       " 'review': \" Love that this is an addition to the Dogpatch area! I remember when this first came to SF I waited 30 min in line at a SPARK food festival to get my hands on one. So nice to walk in and order in an actual brick and mortar joint! This isn't like the traditional ones I've had in China but they're still tasty! The only downsides are as others have mentioned:1. The sauce isn't as spicy as flavorful as I had hoped. Even with the addition of the $1 picked veggie it still lacked a kick. I'm going to order extra spicy with extra sauce next time.2. The outside was a bit undercooked and doughy. Still good but it wasn't as well done as it could be. Still going to frequent this joint though.,I got the roast duck jian bing and the mango sago. Both were really good and reminded me of authentic jian bing!,Happy Cow Creamery & Tea is an Asian dessert spot in the Dogpatch. I've recently just noticed it and was surprised to find out that they house a permanent popup inside that serves jianbing, one of my favorite Chinese street foods.I haven't had the boba or ice cream here, but I have had their jianbing from Hutong Jianbing inside the restaurant. It looks like there's a permanent popup in here that serves Beijing style Jianbing for $10 each. There's several toppings to choose from including plain, chicken, curry chicken, duck, and beef.The jianbing here is made to order. It's actually a bit different than what I'm sued to from what I've tried in Shanghai. There's less egg, the youtiao is replaced with some other type of fried dough, and no pickled vegetables. However, what you get is still solid and one of the only places I know of in the Bay Area to get jianbing! What a great hidden surprise.,Very delicious Chinese crepes, bringing back so many memories about childhood. They come with a kick, so order less spicy if you're like me and cannot take too much spice at once. I like to call in ahead of time when I'm on my way for pick up. It takes a few minutes for them to make the crepes. Very friendly staff, helpful and warm.,Look past the front door of Happy Cow Creamy ¬†& Tea, there is magic folded in the Chinese crepesOne veggie, spicy, was inexpensive and Delicious!Worth a visit ¬†.... with ice ¬†cream for dessert of course,Friendly hosts, and tasty Jian Bing! Wish that pork jian bing is with pork belly not grounded pork, but the flavor is really good.,I've been to this restaurant multiple times now and it never disappoints. Definitely hits the spot when I'm craving Chinese street food, and the portions are super generous!,Good jian bing, but personally I prefer the crispy kinds. Didn't quite satisfy me. Taste was decent and it was okay for a Beijing style.,I enjoyed the original and the roast duck Jianbing! My family was hoping for more sauce on the side. I'll definitely come back again! Great service. The workers follow the 6 ft rule. They wiped down the credit card screen and have a bottle of hand sanitizer out for you to use.,Came here with my baby girl for her first ever salty crepe and both of us LOVE it! We ordered the duck JianBing and oh my oh! Can you image a combo of a chewy soft skin and a crispy sheet with this super flavorful sauces and juicy pulled duck meats!!! Would highly recommend this boba and jianbing to everyone!,This was pretty average compared to the amazing ones from China. Overall, it is tasty but just lacked textures and flavors to be in the next dimension. For example, the crepe lacked chew and the fillings were a bit dull. Solid choice nonetheless for an authentic dish but don't expect magic.,I was quite excited when I learned this is gonna be in my neighborhood. I tried the roasted duck fried pancake and it did not disappoint! The portion was huge (it comes in 2 servings) and the price was very affordable. I'm so glad when I find out this is not just a pop-up and the boba place will continue to serve them. Can't wait to come back and try out a different one next time!,My weekend jian bing go-to! Love the roast duck flavor the most, but my husband and I always have to eat it in the car or else it gets soggy by the time we get home since so much condensation builds within the wax paper bag. If eaten immediately off the crepe maker, the jian bing's interior is perfectly crispy!,I love jian bing. It's one of the many Chinese food I missed the most. Stoped by this place to try it. I'd say it's ok but not as good or authentic as the real one in China. The soy paste inside tasted weird. Their customer service was alright.,It wasn't hard to find the place- just make sure to confirm with the staff if you are unsure. We ordered the curry chicken, pork and a regular bing. There was no one at the place so the food was made fresh and came out quickly. The food was okay- wish it was a bit more crispy and and more spicy(we ordered the spicy one). Conveniently Located for a quick fix.,Got the roasted duck Jian bing. One order is split between 2 paper bags so it's easy for sharing. The flavors were great and the duck was crunchy. Will come back again to try the other fillings! There was no one there when I went around 5:30pm.,Amazing Jian Bing and very fast service. ¬†It's a bit hard to find, as it's a pop up at a boba shop.,It's a new concept from Beijing. It's crispy inside with special sauce. The portion is good for two girls. It's better to eat it within 20-30 minutes.,The first time I learned about this pop up was from another location. This time I ordered their Lamb Jian Bing and it was really tasty. The crisp inside the crepe was crispy while the outside is soft. It's yummy! Note that if you eat the crepe late the crisp inside will get soaky. So better eat it right after it's served.\",\n",

Kinda a small dining room on main level, then a balcony of seats on floor 2 that surrounds the dining room on 2 sides. ¬†Our table of 6 was all by itself on the right upper level- so perfect for us to all catch up with each other.Our FANTASTIC waiter Frederick was friendly and attentive, I wanted a lot of ice, he brought us 2 pitchers of ice! We ordered drinks (note that due to them only have a wine/beer license, their \"cocktails\" are made with low-proof rum or vodka.)We ordered some fried okra and some corn muffins to start and share. ¬†The okra comes with a snappy dipping sauce. (Note the corn muffins are pretty small).I ordered the fried chicken (leg and thigh) with Jambalaya and the collard greens. My man had the short ribs with red beans and rice and cream cheese grits. ¬†Both entrees were heaven, but the fried chicken is one of the top 5 fried chicken dinners in SF. Very crispy and not greasy.For dessert we split all three dessert offerings: a steamed white chocolate bread pudding, pecan pie and the beignets. ¬†Of the 3 we all enjoyed the bread pudding the most.Note there is a $26 lunch special we all agreed we wanted to come back for - which includes an appetizer a entree and a dessert. (If I am remembering correctly),I really wanted to like this pace. We are in need of good creole cuisine. Unfortunately they were having a private party that night. We sat outside, but I think you miss out of the experience. The smells of all the food. The feel of the place. All missing. The food looked alright, but lacked the outstanding taste.I had the shrimp and grits. I normally love this dish. This just didn\\'t grab me. My friend had the Shrimp & Crawfish √âtouff√©e that was slightly better.The cornbread was wonderful! I could have eaten a whole plate of these! And it didn\\'t even need the extra butter, yum!,I enjoyed the vibes of this place. It was decorated nicely for the holiday season.The food was decent. I\\'m not sure if anything stood out so much that would make me come back. Fried okra appetizer was good, great plate to share. The shrimp Po boy was decent. The portion was pretty large, and I only had half and took the rest to go. And it comes with a side salad which is nice. Overall, the mains were good, but not great. Beignets with a salted caramel sauce and the bread pudding were both great dessert options. I would recommend these.,Def worth heading into Cole Valley for this gem of a restaurant. We were sat upstairs and enjoyed it. They currently have cute holiday decorations. The service was fantastic. Our server Julian was incredibly attentive and accommodating. Really appreciated that he asked for food allergies right at the beginning. The food was great. Our table shared the fried okra, hush puppies, and boudin balls--all were tasty. I had the short ribs with collard greens and creamy grits. Highly recommend. For dessert with the bread pudding and beignets--would also highly recommend. ¬†The only thing worth nothing was the restaurant was bit smoky inside and a few us needed a moment to stop coughing.,Meh? It was nice to come here at least once, but I wouldn\\'t come back for any dish or side. We had the boudin balls, fried okra, braised short rib, gumbo, shrimp and crawfish etouffee, and fried chicken to share between the three of us. Highlights - service was fantastic, the ambiance reminded us of NOLA, and the etouffee was seasoned and cooked very well. Things that we\\'d pass on if we came back - the boudin balls didn\\'t have much flavor, the gumbo was extremely briny, and the short rib didn\\'t come out as tender as we would have liked. For the price point, we were also expected some larger portions, but it is what it is. We would opt for a different creole restaurant the next time around.,Came here with my friends for lunch during the SF Restaurant week. It\\'s a cute little restaurant at the corner of the intersection. There were still quite a few people there at 1pm on a Saturday. I got the seafood gumbo as my appetizer and the shrimp & crawfish etouffee as my entree. The pre fix menu included a piece of beignet as dessert. Seafood gumbo - I\\'ve had better. There weren\\'t much of that Cajun kick. Shrimp & crawfish etouffee - my first time trying etouffee so I don\\'t have anything to compare it with. The stew/sauce it came with was on the sweet side. It was decent, but not mind blowing. The corn bread (?) it came with was pretty good though. Beignet - my first time having a fresh beignet. It was soooo good. Perfect sweetness & texture. I loved the sugar powder they used too, but that was prob just genetic powder lol. Overall, 3.5 stars. I wouldn\\'t go out of my way to come here, but if you\\'re in this area and craving dessert, I\\'d recommend giving their beignet a try. Rounding it up to 4 stars for the cornbread and beignet.,Love this bright corner spot serving up elevated Nola cuisine! Really cute space, would be a great spot for a private party. Fantastic chicken jambalaya - I\\'ve never had the pleasure of a whole piece of chicken in my jambalaya let alone one soooo juicy. Friend got the mushroom jambalaya which looked good too, and she cleaned her plate. We tried the boudin balls (delish - and yes you can taste the liver) and oyster brochettes, both of which I\\'d recommend. Was a little meh on the hush puppies (give me more corn!) and beignets (I expected lighter - these were quite dense). Then the fried okra was maybe just a little too much fried food with remoulade you know? Staff was lovely and really busy. FYI they do charge you a deposit for reservations so make sure they subtract that from your final bill!,I went for SF restaurant week and got their lunch menu. I often find that SF restaurant week is really worth it. Usually it\\'s smaller portions, or the same food bundled together into a pre fixe menu and more expensive. I had previously been to CreoLa and really enjoyed their food so I decided to visit again.I got the cornmeal crusted catfish, which comes with two sides. The catfish pieces were huge. The crust was perfectly intact and wasn\\'t soggy. It didn\\'t feel greasy either even though it was deep fried. Highly recommend order this.The beignet was fresh and hot. More doughy than other beignets that I\\'ve had, but still good.The vegan soup was the most disappointing because it was just black eyed peas and green beans (which I ordered for my sides). Nothing special about it.The service was pretty good. We were seated on the second floor and the staff would come and check in on us from time to time.The restaurant itself is very cute and definitely had some New Orleans vibes. If they played jazz music that\\'s be the cherry on top.,CreoLa was a beautiful splash of color and flavor in the middle of the workweek, when I visited SF in July. It\\'s one of the *few* times where I\\'ll admit that my environment was so comfortable and rich (piano music, large windows for people-watching) that I didn\\'t mind the speed of service---mind you, it wasn\\'t slow, but it wasn\\'t speedy. However, this is likely due to the fact that the food is made with ingredients that are quality, and taste+feel incredibly fresh. I definitely got the sense that my food was made to order.Be on the lookout for lunch specials that allow you to sample a bit of everything. I definitely could have done that (eg. that day, they were serving pre fixe lunched with your choice of entree). I opted for a gorgeous catfish po\\'boy, because that Cajun-style fish is so flavorful. Perfectly crispy, sandwiched between perfectly soft and buttery French bread. The kind you expect to cut into your mouth, but this one didn\\'t. I also shared in the Cajun jambalaya, and just look at that color. Spicy, salty, right where my heart needed to be that afternoon.But despite the generous portions, we always have room for fresh beignets with caramel sauce. From the entrees to the piping-hot pastries, CreoLa was dripping with decadence and sheer experience. Definitely give it a try, and always leave room for dessert.,Food was 4/5 stars but the ambiance and service knocked it to a 5. Such a cute little place that transports you out of SF with the jazz music and interior design! The seafood it came with was cooked well; and the dishes were solid. We got the gumbo, fried okra, crawfish and shrimp etouffe, green beans with shaved garlic and side of cornbread. I liked all the dishes but would say it didn\\'t blow my mind. But I really appreciated the server who was so kind and checked up on us at all the right times.,I\\'m impressed. CreoLa\\'s cute interior sets the stage for the amazing meal you are about to have. They have nailed cooked chicken. My chicken jumbalaya was so incredibly moist and flavorful. We even started our meals with a bene and coffee for an affordable $6! CreoLa is great for a casual brunch and also a nice dinner out. Since it\\'s located right next to the park, you can take a walk after to burn off the calories from your delicious meal.'"
