Kothai Republic,"KOREAN-THAI, KOTHAI! It has a nice ring to it. January 28, 2023 - Date night. When Kothai popped up on my yelp account, I knew I had to try it.Honestly, I wanted to order everything on the menu. I wanted to indulge in the world of Korean and Thai mixed together. As a half Chinese and half Korean breed, I've tried plenty of Korean/Chinese cuisines. Never had I ever had Korean and Thai infused together. In my brain, it already made perfect sense because I LOVE spicy. I cannot eat a meal and feel satisfied without having high levels of spiciness. So you can already feel how excited I was when 2 culinary countries known for spiciness and flavor came together. ECSTATIC!Thai Crudo was pretty impressive. It was their take on a papaya salad. I didn't know Hamachi will compliment papayas well. It worked! The flavors were very soft, not overly seasoned. It made this appetizer truly appetizing. It was the perfect starter to get our appetite's wet. Beets and pear salad was so refreshing! They were not stingy with the amount of beets and juicy pears they served. Husband is not about veggies, but he kept going for seconds and thirds. Korean BBQ Steak with their ""garbage"" sauce is a must. My goodness! The steak itself was prepared med-rare and it was super-juicy-super-tender-super-duper-yummilicious! This beautiful, crazy-delicious, concoction of ""garbage"" sauce got us dipping and Dipping and kept on DIPPING with every bite. You'll just have to order it for yourself and find out why it's called their ""garbage sauce.""I've had plenty shares of Hamachi Kama. But the way KOTHAI prepared it was phenomenal. It was a burst of flavors that tingled my taste buds. The breadcrumbs were crunchy, buttery and acidic. The broccoli rabe added bitterness and pepperiness to balance the breadcrumbs. And when eaten with the hamachi, it's like fireworks in your mouth. As I'm writing this review, my mouth is getting watery. My least favorite was the Tom Yum. The rice noodles were over cooked that it was slimy. But that's okay, some people might like that. I'll have to go back to try their beef noodle soup in hopes that it'll be more enjoyable. Thai Tea - MUST GET! Strong, creamy and not too sweet. It's my kind of style. I'm sensitive to caffeine so I was up all night feeling jittery, but so worth it! It's the best Thai tea I've ever had. In a world where boba/thai tea drinks are life, finding my favorite Thai tea spot is a true gem. Service was slow at first. We had to wait a while to order, but once the order was made, it was smooth sailin'. The owner (Korean) served most of our dishes and he seemed so personable. He engaged in conversation with us which really made us feel welcomed. He also expressed his gratitude to us for trying his restaurant. It was refreshing to be acknowledged because many places nowadays lack this form of hospitality. There's several more dishes that I want to try so we'll definitely be back! Oh~ I can't wait. Welcome to SF KOTHAI! You've settled in the most perfect place, a city that's always cold, your dishes will bring such warmth to our souls.,I heard about this Thai/Korean fusion restaurant that opened up recently and I just had to try it. I came here to eat lunch with a friend and both of us enjoyed the meal. We did order a little bit too much and did end up having to take some food back home.The three things we ordered:- korean spicy noodles with pork- tom yum noodle soup with small rice noodles- bibimbap (not pictured)We also ordered their thai tea and their lavender coffee. For me personally, I thought the thai tea was too sweet for me. I would have preferred if there was less sugar in the tea. The korean spicy noodles were great! It had a great amount of flavor and I would order this again. The bibimbap was also delicious. The server came up to me and recommended us to eat the meat with their green sauce and that was delicious! Make sure you try their green sauce that they will provide to you. Lastly, the tom yum noodle soup tasted a little bit different from what I am used to. This wasn't my favorite dish out of the three, but it was still good. Overall, I would come back again to try their dishes. The service was great as well, and the interior was really pretty. This place is definitely a good spot for a date night or for a casual lunch or dinner with friends.,Great dishes and execution. I loved the Tom Yum, grilled fish and Korean noodles. The food was fantastic and gave me and my partner positive moodletts for the times we went. Pro-tip: It's not on the menu but the cheesecake is amazing.,Kothai Republic has so much potential and I can foresee that if they tweak their dishes just a bit, this place can exceed expectations. Came here on a Tuesday and there was no one in the restaurant but my boyfriend and I were enticed but the pictures so we decided to give it a try.Waitress was amiable, quick and efficient and made sure we were checked up on constantly. The food, on the other hand, was of high quality ingredients but I didn't really care much for the execution of the dishes. The pear and beet salad was a strange combo and the sweetness of the pears overwhelmed the overall crisp salad which I personally could not palate. The beef noodle soup was delicious but the broth was overly salty for me. The beef was tender and juicy and made up for the broth. The noodles were cooked to perfection and was able to withhold  the flavors the broth well.Overall, I do see this place taking off in the near future.,Food truck turned brick and mortar. Still definitely working out the flow (saw our food pass our table twice, return to the kitchen to check which table and then brought to our table hahaha) but overall very well ran kitchen with great food. Would've tweaked a few things about the food but overall would give them a 4.5/5Ambiance: 4/5 smallish open seating area that is simple and clean. beautiful plates! Definitely be prepared to wait if you arrive 7p or later on a weekend night. Service: 5/5 staff was prompt and made sure our glasses were never empty.Food: Kimchi fried rice balls: 5/5 really nice texture. Mayo sauce on top was Yumm. Korean noodle: 5/5 would def order this again. They subbed the chicken out with pork and the pork was perfectly cooked and the sauce on it was the right amount of umami. It was paired with a refreshing cabbage slaw and the noodles were seasoned perfectly. Tom yum: 5/5 probably not your typically Tom yum but oh so yummy. Def more creamy than I'm used to but it was really good. Portion size is generous. The pork in mine was a little firm but the shrimp were JUICY and THICCCC. Spice was just right as well. The noodles do really soak up the soup though so would recommend splitting this if you don't eat a lot - wouldn't recommend taking this home for leftovers. Would def order this again. Beef noodle soup: 5/5 again not the typical BNS - the noodles are more like vermicelli/rice?? Not the egg noodle I'm used to. Almost had a pho like spin on the broth as well. But the add in spice sauce was fire and the meat was TENDER in this soup. Same comment as the Tom yum- finish it here; won't go home we'll. Chicken noodle: 3/5 chicken itself was really tender and good. Noodles were cooked well but a little bland. They come with a mushroom sauce which I didn't feel like it added much to the dish. I would love to see this dish with garlic noodle instead ! Overall definitely a place I will come back to!,Amazing. Will 100% come back again!! The food was exactly what we were looking for. Tom Yum Soup- Our favorite of the night!! It had fried pork skins in it that added such a nice savory crunch to the soup. The flavor of the soup was rich and complex, not too sour, and not too sweet. Kimchi Rice Balls- We reallyyy enjoyed these!! The crispy exterior with the mayo sauce and savory kimchi fried rice was a good combo. Korean noodle- awesome. I'm Korean, and I definitely know I had something like this before so it reminded me of mom's cooking and still tasted really good. They substituted it with pork on the menu this night, and it paired really well with the fried rice. Chicken Noodle- The chicken in this dish was really good good. Super moist and tender chicken that fell off the bone. The noodle wasn't as flavorful as I hoped, but it was fried well. Beef Noodle Soup- My friend got the beef noodle soup and he loved it! The Thai iced tea was to die for, all of my friends are milk tea fans and this one had great proportions of cream and tea. The service was also pretty good. They were so friendly and quickly and kindly accommodated any requests, and made sure to keep filling our waters. I'll be back for sure!!! So happy to find such a great place!! My only recommendation is to come earlier rather than later, since it fills up at around 7pm!,We went at 6pm on a Friday night and was immediately seated. It's good to go early because it was a full house by the time we left, with people waiting at the front and outside. It was the two of us and we ordered three items: peer and beet salad, hamachi, and tom yum noodle soup. I thought I would need dessert after but we were full at the end. Our eyes eat first and Kothai beautifully presented all their dishes. The salad started my appetite with the delicious taste of feta cheese and picked onions. In contrast, the pears and beets were light and refreshing, a great combo! I would reorder this dish. Hamachi seafood dish came out the same time as our salad. Again, a feast to our eyes. The skin was perfectly crispy and the inside was tender. No need to add lemon as the chefs have already done that for you. Don't forget the broccolini with the crunchy breadcrumbs. Tasty! I would recommend a bowl of white rice to complement all the flavor.Finally, after conversing for a while, the Tom Yum noodle soup, came out. The soup isn't like the normal soup at Thai restaurants like Banana Island. I would liken it to ramen soup which is thicker. Surprisingly, it was still light to the taste. The bean sprouts and crispy skin toppings provided texture to the noodles. Yummy! It's been awhile since I gave a 5 star review, but this is one of them. Service was a bit slow but they are still new and it was a Friday night. Viet Gao has a competitor on the block!,Possibly closer to a 3.5 than 4, but since it's a new restaurant and I've only tried 2 items I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.I was super excited when I saw this place opened and it's a fusion of two of my favorite cuisines, Thai and Korean. The interior is super bright and modern, and street parking was relatively easy to find on a weekday at lunch time. There was no wait so we were immediately seated. The waitress bought over the menus and immediately asked me if we wanted water or hot tea. Maybe I should've known better than to assume since it's SF, but since it's partially a Korean restaurant I assumed hot tea would be free but was surprised after I ordered and actually had time to look at menu that it was $5.We ordered the tom yum soup upon recommendation by one of the staff members, and the Korean Spicy Noodle. The dishes were beautifully presented and we were super excited to taste it. We really enjoyed the Tom yum noodle soup; it had a nice kick and was flavorful. Unfortunately we did not enjoy the Korean Spicy Noodle (non-vegan version) dish anywhere near as much. The crispy chicken as mentioned on the menu actually came in the form of a fried chicken ball that just did not work for me. It seemed to have a very strong curry/lentil flavor mixed with shredded chicken that just did not pair well with the dish in my opinion. The noodles themselves were alright, nothing spectacular.I do hope to come by again in the future and try some of their other dishes as I do think there's quite a few unique items they have that I have yet to try!,We saw this new restaurant the other day while walking and decided to return to try. The restaurant is lovely with wonderful bright lighting from the windows and stylish furniture. Their liquor license is pending but that wasn't an issue for us as we tried the Thai iced tea which was really good. It tasted the way Thai iced tea should. Hubby and I really liked the bibimbap. Tasty and even more Unami when you add the sauce on the side. I would order this dish again. The Tom yum soup was good and I really liked the rice noodles and 3 pieces of roast pork (gimme more!) but it was too spicy for me. We ate the dish and left some of the soup behind. The wait staff was also very nice. We sat near the kitchen staff window and were able to see the busy staff at work. Such a nice place. Menu is limited but we plan to return to sample some of the other dishes.,Great new addition to Inner Sunset. Overall a great experience but since they're new want to post some feedback on what could be improved. The meats were very good, especially the skirt steak galbi special they served the night my friends and I went (would recommend bringing that into the default menu!). Biggest area of improvement were the noodles. The noodles tended to be very bland, especially the chicken noodles. I'd consider mixing the sauce into it instead of having it plated separately. The kimchi noodles were definitely a bit better flavored. This is more opinionated but I would have preferred more of the kimchi spice to shine but instead I got a lot of gochujang flavor.,I'm so excited to have this amazing restaurant in the neighborhood. For now it's easy to walk in, but I'm sure people will catch on. The soups were very tasty- broths were complex, lots of noodles and textures. I'm not sure which one I liked more.  They were perfect for a cold night.,For dine in on Tuesday, January 10, 2023The restaurant would be closing in 50 minutes for the afternoon when we left the hospital for lunch. My sister asked for recommendations because it was our first time eating there. I had intended to order chicken noodle and was disappointed that it wasn't available. For starters, we went with the popular Kimchi Rice Balls. I chose the Bibimbap and my sister, the Beef Noodle Soup.It was very clean in the restaurant and we were able to see the chefs cooking in the kitchen.The Kimchi Rice Balls had a crunchy exterior and plenty of flavor. The beef noodle had 2 big pieces of beef shank, on choy, and crispy pork rinds. My Bibimbap had beef cubes, sliced shitake mushrooms, sprouts, baby carrots, zucchini rolls, radish kimchi, and a soft egg not overly runny. There was flavor already and I found myself only putting dabs of accompanying sauce for extra flavor.We had enjoyed our little adventure out to try a restaurant near the hospital and the storm had held. It was time to go back to the hospital.,A spot worth trying with an explosion of flavors!O R D E R E D- pears & beets- hamachi crudo- korean spicy noodle- chicken toast- hamachi kama- chicken noodle- beef noodle soupV E R D I C TIf you haven't tried out Kothai, you are missing out! They have the perfect spot for lunch with their open window / open kitchen interior and you have so much light that comes in to keep you warm and your food looking bright. All of their dishes hit the spot in the flavor department, as well as being photogenic. The Kothai team puts their own spin on some staple dishes, as well as some they created on their own. They put a mix of Korean and Thai flavors and spices that won't leave you disappointed. I don't have a favorite dish because  everything was delicious - I will saw the pears and beet salad did blow my taste buds away as soon as I tasted it. Everything was so fresh and portion sizes were perfect with some extra to take home for later. You can taste all the effort the team puts into each dish and how everything brings the flavors all together. Parking would be either residential or in the public lot at the end of the block near Irving and 9th. They are located RIGHT on the corner or Judah and 9th. They're great for both dinner and lunch, see you soon!,In the past 2 weeks, we've been here 3 times. Yes, it's that good. It's comfort food with a pleasant twist. My favs so far are the chicken noodles (dry style) and apple cheesecake (not on the menu but GET IT). The flavors, textures, and presentation are so carefully curated and thought out. These guys are passionate about their craft and it shows. One of the owners (Hi Sung!) genuinely cares about what you think and will take any critique into consideration to try to make their food even better...which is hard to find nowadays, especially when you've been in the food industry for as long as he has. Oh yeah, and it's BYOB! Come give it a try before it gets too popular and busy!,My partner and I were really excited to try this new restaurant in the neighborhood! This Korean/Thai fusion food truck-turned-restaurant is a wonderful addition to the inner sunset. Service was great and super friendly. The interior is clean and minimal with beautiful plate ware. We loved the beef noodle soup and the Korean spicy noodle dishes! We're glad we came in and can't wait to try other dishes next time :),We stumbled unto Kothai Republic. Just come check out their beef noodle soup. Say no more.The cleanliness of the space and open ambiance brought us in but the taste and quality made us return two days in a row. They're also super friendly and with a mission. It's unbeatable at the price point. We've been to literally all restaurants in the neighborhood and we are very excited for Kothai Republic. Taste: Quality: Ambiance:,Nicely decorated and good service! The restaurant is within walking distance of Golden Gate Park. Dishes were beautifully presented and excellent balance of spice and flavor. Good portions - we walked out full! Forgot to take pic of arugula salad with pear and toasted coconut - refreshing and dilling. I squeezed a lime on the Tom Yum soup and was very happy.,Everything was so good! Brought a few friends and was able to try literally everything. Perfect date night place too, not too expensive with Michelin like plating and nice ambiance (^u^),We were a party of 3. We shared appetizers and each ordered an entree. Me and one friend do not like cheese so they were kind enough to put the feta cheese on the side for the person that likes cheese.Some up us cannot handle spicy so they were able to accommodate us. Everything was delicious. We would definitely go back again. All of us said our entree meats were cooked to perfection: so moist and tender.,Solid place! We had the Tom Yum and the Beef Noodle soup. Delicious :)The staff are extremely friendly and the atmosphere is super chill. You can tell they staff are very passionate about customer service.,Shiny, new, very inviting setup. The owners seem like family and are very, very happy to see you. This was really pleasant. The food is tasty-- I had the kimchi rice balls and the Tom yum soup. The soup is AMAZING. I will definitely come back for it. It was packed full of proteins and I don't think I've ever had better prepared giant shrimp in a soup. Shrimp are so easy to overlook, but these were tail free, enormous, and perfectly cooked so they weren't tough or rubbery. And it was incredibly filling. I'd come back again and again just for the soup alone!,Best new addition to the Inner Sunset's 9th Avenue corridor. A small, focused menu brings out incredible flavors. Best tom yum I've ever had. As the family will tell you, they take the time every day to create their own shrimp stock, a detail which matters when it comes to depth of flavor. Everything else we ordered was elevated without ostentatiousness, well-portioned, and satisfying. Can't wait to go back.A warm, welcoming, bright space, Kothai Republic has that undeniable feel of a new restaurant in SF which (if we're all very lucky) will grow to be an iconic neighborhood spot.,Highly recommend this wonderful new spot! Flavors and seasoning were bright, crisp with fresh herbs. Unique combination of Thai and Korean - can't believe haven't tried before! Wasn't too garlic forward which suits our palette. Recommendations - hamachi collar, spicy Korean noodles (the meat is an extra delicious surprise.)  swing by arzemendi for a sweet cookie after!,My first time at Kothai - I went for lunch and had the beef noodle soup - really enjoyed it!Broth was tasty and all ingredients looked fresh and good - looks like a lot of care is put into the cooking. I am glad that we have such a special addition to the neighborhood and hope they will keep up the good work - we needed such a restaurant.I'll be back for more - thank you!,Kothai Republic is a welcomed new addition to the great food scene in the Inner Sunset. Clean, minimal aesthetic inside lends itself well to a either date night or a casual night out with friends. For dinner, we had the beef noodle soup and bibimbap. The soup had a great, rich broth and super yummy braised brisket. The bibimbap had super fresh vegetables and was a sizable portion for around $18. For an appetizer, we ordered the kimchi rice balls which had a panko-type crust on the outside, filled with kimchi, fried rice, and bacon on the inside. My only feedback is that I wish there were 3 kimchi rice balls instead of two - they were awesome, and awe would have loved to have split a third one! Service was great and attentive as well. Overall super positive dining experience, I will be back!,Food is interesting and delicious. I am looking forward to exploring the rest of the menu.,Small mix of Korean and Thai selections.  Very good tom yum and other items are tasty as well.The space is comfortable and a good addition to the neighborhood.I look forward to my next visit.,Loved all the food, especially the pear and beet salad. The space has a nice clean design with lots of natural light and the service was great. I can't eat gluten and they explained which dishes are GF and which can be altered to make them GF. We'll be going back soon!,Really nice new restaurant on 9th with great Korean food! The staff were very kind and gave us a free appetizer. The Korean spicy noodle was fantastic!,Tom yum soup is a must try if you enjoy a kick of spiciness in the broth, it's hearty with intense shrimp flavor, and probably boiled in high heat for a long period of time. Kimchi is super fresh, as you bite into the leafy cabbage, the crunch of will ignite the nostalgia of hometown cooking. A dish I will order again. It's a great addition to the neighborhood.,KP was outstanding! The food was delicious and service impeccable. Shared the Asian pear/ beet salad and bibimbap braised beef. Dishes were beautifully presented and cuisine outstanding. I would go back again and again.,This restaurant has a small menu but the food is different but  very tasty .Healthy and thought out.Give this place a try.Fusion Asian food.Servers are nice and helpful.Refilled our hot water. Checked on us many times.We went for lunch.I had the Bimbibop. I substituted for chicken.They gave me a chicken leg. So tender.My friend had the beef noodle soup. She was very satisfied,my bestie and i enjoyed this place so much. we went for a quick lunch during a busy day and the vibe here was so calm. the servers are really attentive :) even though they don't have a large menu the food seems to be well thought out and there is definitely something for everyone. it quickly joined our rotation of regular spaces!,Amazing new family-run restaurant! Super delicious flavors (we had the crispy pork, bibimbap, noodle soup and wish we had room for more), friendly service, lovely modern space, nice ambiance. Excellent portion sizes and prices.,Outstanding food made with attention and love.  Front of the house staff is friendly and informative and the kitchen staff pays attention to every detail.  I came here for lunch with two friends and all three of us were blown away.  This is a family operation and we're going do our part to make sure they are successful!  Don't miss the skirt steak!,Creative and tasty menu! The beef stew tasted amazing, and the Bibimbap bowl was hearty. Vegetables were flavorful and substantial. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Definitely will be coming here again.,One of the best restaurants I have eaten at in the sunset districts. Each food item was immaculate with an abundance of flavors in every single bite. The owner was amazing and created a fantastic menu. Highly recommend this place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Savor,"I ordered the Mushroom Shawarma, I was very impressed with the flavor! The sauce that is in this sandwich is amazing! Goes well with the greens and mushroom inside. Will definitely be coming back to try more. The soup that was included was the curry lentil soup. That had good flavor as well. I am not crazy about lentils so not so crazy about the soup but it was flavorful!,Some of the best food I can remember. Just had dinner, where we ordered the artichoke tangine, wild mushroom pate, Beyond meat shwarma wrap, fennel baklava, and wild mushroom knaffe. Everything was across-the-board delicious and astoundingly tasty. There was so much detail and unique touches to every dish, and so many creative layers of flavors. The place looked like a cafe but the food felt like it came from a much fancier restaurant.My particular favorite was the shwarma, which was probably the tastiest wrap I can ever remember eating. The spices, the pomegranate seeds, the garlic yogurt sauce, the way the textures combined was just fabulous. Can't wait to go back. As a side note, the music and sound system was surprisingly good.,Absolutely blown away by the food here! We love ordering to go, and have tried these dishes so far:Artichoke Shawarma (3/5)- This is a popular one, but not as flavorful as some of the other dishes IMOPortobello Mushroom Shawarma (4/5)- solid vegan optionPulled King Trumpet Burger (5/5)- I don't know what they put in this but we were blown away! The king trumpet is so juicy and seasoned well, and the ""buns"" of the burger are made from a croissant like pastry that complements the burger so well. Highly recommend trying this oneSavor Platter (4/5)- Good mix of different dipsPotato & Sage Torte (4/5)- what's not to love about potato and phyllo?Mashi (stuffed eggplant) (4/5) - great flavors,Excellent!* Probably the best Mediterranean food I've ever eaten.* Very creative dishes. First time eating savory knaffeh. * Meze platter was spectacular - fresh peta, perfectly fried falafel, even great baba ganoush, which I usually don't like because I dislike eggplant.* Very friendly chef and staff* Already looking forward to coming back for trying the remaining dishes and desserts!Cons:* Price is on the higher side, so perhaps can't go here too often. These are all tapas small plates. * Decor is ok but as the business takes off, I'm sure this will improve.,We ordered a platter, mushroom knaffeh and beetroot salad.Gosh! The food was amazing. I think this is probably the best Mediterranean food I have ever had! One of the best vegetarian restaurants in the city.1. Flavors were on the point 2. Amazing presentation 3. The falafel was moist and crispy 4. Innovative food like savory knaffeh! Really?5. I wanted a dressing on side and they were accommodating.The restaurant is small and has few tables. Our server was nice! We even talked to the Chef and he was nice to talk to! If I could give this place a 10/5 I would have Don't think just visit this place!,Had a great lunch here this week. I'm not vegan and didn't realize it was a vegan restaurant until we looked at the menu. Everything was delicious, we had  the mushroom knaffe, the Savor platter, the daily soup and baklava. I'll definitely be back.,Incredible new stuff every week, some of the best desserts and soups I've ever had in my life. Don't bother looking at the menu, the best stuff is the daily specials - just come in and ask Mohammad for lunch (or dinner).,If you're vegetarian or vegan and love Mediterranean style food with a creative flair, Savor is for you! Great service, full flavors and a nice location close to the park make this a go to for you and your friends and family. Very thoughtful and caring establishment.,What a gem of a find.  I have never experienced vegetarian/Vegan food I have really enjoyed......until now.  This is my favorite restaurant in a city of restaurants.  If you want excellent coffee, pastries, torts, etc.  for lunch or dinner do yourself a favor and dine at Savor, you will thank me for the referral.  I can't recommend one dish over another because everything served is michelin star quality!  The trumpet mushroom burgers are to die for and don't forget the unbelievable breakfast burrito.,This is the best mediterranean food I have ever had! Muhammad the owner runs the place mostly by himself and does an incredible job. He even makes all the pastries in house!  Highly recommend checking it out!,Truly makes you want to savor every bite. Incredible combination of quality ingredients and delightful flavours.Appearing quite reserved at first glance, the owner lives and breathes hospitality, cooking and serving the meal himself when crowds allow. Here you feel taken care of in the old-school 5-star hotel kind of way.Beautiful original pencil sketches on the wall and middle eastern decor spice up the ambience. Come see the master at work.,HOLY YUM YUM BATMAN! This place is absolutely phenomenal! I haven't been this blown away by a new restaurant in a while. The food here is fresh, healthy, delicious and made with love! The owner kindly recommended the artichoke shawarma and it did not disappoint! Packed with flavor, this sandwich was creamy, fresh and delicious. I paired it with their soup of the day, gazpacho, perfect for a hot day like today! I've actually never had cold soup before but this was soooo refreshing and the flavors were blasting through each sip. Lastly, he recommended a gluten free/vegan pastry they had today made with apples, chocolate and almonds. Needless to say, it was obviously spectacular! I can't say enough good things about this place, I wish I could be I've more than 5 stars! I can't wait to come back and try everything on the menu!,I've followed Chef Mo for years - he's always had the best vegetarian food and at his new place here on Irving - it's just as I remembered maybe even better. We ordered the fattoush salad which was bright, lemony and fresh. Then my favorite surprise of the mushroom shawarma and artichoke soup was fantastic.  You don't miss meat - you leave feeling full and light and healthy. Such beautiful food from a beautiful human.  We will be back for dinner!,This place is fantastic.  Have been there for dinner twice in the last week. Don't less the casual feel fool you - the food is very creative, fun, and delicious, and the chef and staff are super friendly. I'd recommend going with a few other people so you can try as many things for the menu as possible!,Awwww this was genuinely unique. Solid 4 because the chef was so nice. My brother has a gf and nf allergy and he said ""next time I'll try to have a dessert for you""! How sweet. This is how vegan food should be. Very much emphasis on the natural flavors of the plants. Wouldn't get the knafe again bc sauce a little too sweet. And the top was crispy but bottom too soft for me. The textures together of soft and crispy i couldn't get around. 3/5. But still I could acknowledge some of the nuance and uniqueness so I was happy. Quinoa cake was a surprising banger 5/5 I wish I could've had more haha. The sauce or mash thing on the side was interesting but the cake layers itself amazing. My gf bro loved it. Beets 5/5 the sauce is divine. He made it nf almond free for my bro. Great flavor complexity. This is fine dining. Asked the waiter for some sumac and he gave me some to sprinkle for extra. So sweet. No extra charge. Clean simple quick spot and service. Unique Arabic food for us vegans loved it.,This is the best hidden gym in inner sunset.Food is so different and tasty from everything else on the Irving/9th strip. So refreshing.A lot of vegan/veggie options. Fresh. Tasty. Grab a latte and fresh baked item. Brownies are amazing! And croissants. Basically everything Mohammad makes. Or have a full lunch. Paninis and beet salad are my favorite.Oh yeah the soup!! He has this magical artichoke soup that is life changing. Must try,I have followed Chef Mohammed ever since he was at Patisserie Cafe back in the late 1990s/early 2000's and Knew him from SAHA (SF and Berkeley).  I'm a huge fan of his soups and sauces since he can make even vegetables you hate taste wonderful.  Since we are friends with Chef, we let him do his thing.   We got the mushroom shawarma and artichoke shawarma and split them.  His food is extraordinarily delicious and fun to eat.  Everyone I spoke with was in a GREAT mood, smiling and enjoying the delicious food.  We were so happy and will definitely be back.,My second time here - and it's as wonderful as the first!  Super flavorful and delicious!  I'm not vegan or vegetarian and I LOVE this place :),Excellent!* Probably the best Mediterranean food I've ever eaten.* Very creative dishes. First time eating savory knaffeh.,I stopped by on soft opening day and was very pleased. Both the portobello shawarma and the malfoufa were delicious with a tasty side salad. They have coffee and bagels, so this will be great for weekend breakfast as well. Start a great addition to the neighborhood!,My husband and I just enjoyed a late lunch at Savor. It was spectacular!  Everything we had was fresh, cooked perfectly and danced with flavor. Chef walked us through the menu and we went with his suggestions. Harvest salad of oven roasted root vegetables was outstanding. Mushroom shwarma were deliciously sloppy!  Kale and lentil soup was fresh and nourishing. Chef had us try their vegan croissant with raspberry filing. UnbelievableEven the cup of Two Leaves and a Bud green tea was superb!Please go and enjoy this neighborhood treasure!,This is easily the best restaurant ive been to in years. The food is sheer bliss. Ive had the green spanish melt, the portobello mushroom shawarma,   stuffed baby beets, and a vegan jam filled croissant; All completely amazing. It is somehow both extremely flavorful and healthy at the same time. Both times ive eaten ive felt physically good and energetic after because of the food quality. Most places the side salads and soups you would just pick at, but this place I scraped the last remnants of them up because theyre so bomb. The food is pretty and the atmosphere of the spot is calm and homey. Great cappuccino and chai latte. The owner was also super nice and inviting even though im a very strange looking queer person. Have already been telling all my friends about it, and am excited to work my way down the menu.,Good food, friendly proprietor, vegan/vegetarian friendly!  We enjoyed our lunch here.It could have been warmer inside.,I go there often... they are small and local. The quality of the food and pastries is amazing. Everything is fresh out of the oven.,WOW just doesn't cut it. Came in with two friends and our collective socks were knocked off!!! Every. Single. Dish. was absolutely mouthwatering, inventive, and soooo tasty. I've never had Yemen food and already can't wait to return to try out every other dish on the menu. This is what small mom & pops are about; inventive, consistent, warm, original, and unmatched. Trust me and goooo! Mohamed is beyond affable and you can really tell he understands flavors. We had the mushroom knaffe, savor platter, eggplant, quinoa cakes, falafels, tofu, coconut curry, banana blueberry bread, and prune tart - there's not a single dish that I wouldn't recommend,Incredible meal -- flavorful, unique flavors, and healthy without being austere. I didn't miss meat at all during the meal which was particularly impressive to me. The staff was friendly and restaurant was cozy. Definitely one of the best dining choices in the sunset!,We had a very nice lunch that included a tasty mushroom Shawarma sandwich with an extremely delicious soup. The bread pudding dessert was extremely good too. The owner made it a very comfortable, welcoming experience. We look forward to coming back for dinner!,Unbelievable. Very homey spot with a chef and owner who cares tremendously about both the quality of food and guests. The mushroom croquette and mushroom shawarma were great but the croquette is OUT OF THID WORLD delicious. Oh my god. This spot is definitely worth savoring.,Wow, we've had brunch here several times and the savory dishes are AMAZING! All the dishes we've tried have been wonderfully seasoned and incredibly well priced. Friends from outside the neighborhood have trekked back to Savor on their own because the food is so good - not just a neighborhood spot!,Found my best dish yet - really reflects Savor flavors.Cauliflower Zatar with lentils - a hands down winner for the complex and fresh spices that came through in both components. So glad this eateryis only one block away - at last an organic (a must!) vegetarian/vegan restaurant for my cooking nights off.  And enough GF dishes/options that I have multiple menu items to choose from.,Very,, very flavorful lunch. The garlic soup was a fabulous start! We each had 1/2 of the artichoke humus shawarma and 1/2 of the mushroom shawarma. We ended with vegan bread pudding.(Was it really vegan? I didn't ask)We bought his cookbook so we can make some of this at home.,If you're looking for some vegan food with a Mediterranean twist, head over to Savor. Their Savor platter is a good start with dips and falafel and we really like their trumpet mushroom burgers.Right on Irving St., it's not far from GG Park.,I stopped by this place after my two hours walk in Golden Gate Park and I were looking for a healthy choice for dinner, and I said let me try this new place and I was so happy that I give it a try.  This new spot has many choices for healthy and vegan food, I tried their fattouch salad was really delicious with fresh ingredients and for drink, I tried their turmeric latte it was the best latte I had for a while.  Excellent customer service, you should give it a try and support the new local business.  Definitely I will be a regular customer at Savor and looking forward to try more vegan choices they have in their menu.,Beyond amazing. Chef Mohamed very warm-hearted. As for everything served, gourmet and authentic! The menu is exceptional and the food lives up to it. I cannot convey in words how delicious, fresh, and distinct the food was. The croissants were sweet, savory and quality: buttery seeded flour encasing a melt-in-your-mouth, savory raspberry filling. The Sougar was dipping into rich tradition come alive: no less authentic and yet modern. SF local hodo tofu accompanied by rings of carmalized onions, with sumptious babaganoush against the flavors of harissa and sumac. Topped with pine-nuts and served with seeded bread. Remarkable quality. Need I say more?This is either the best dining experience I have had in my live, or just beat out by Han Il Kwan: I have yet to decide. Obviously gets my highest reccomendation!,Warm, cozy environment, food, and service. All vegetarian with lots of vegan options too! They don't service alcohol but you can BYOB.,Everything is delicious including the pastries despite being made healthier with less sugar and gluten. Everything is fresh and so, so yum. This place has definitely become a favourite for hearty vegetarian dishes as well. Even my partner loves their food and he's usually the type to pout if there's no meat on the menu. I can't wait to try more of their items including the savory knaffeh!!,Savor is more like a savior if you are a vegan or vegetarian.  Even if you are not I promise you will extremely enjoy the delightful dishes served at this fine establishment.  The menu has so many delicious options it's hard to choose because each order was better then the last.  Service was great, food was better.  Before leaving I told the server that I hadn't left and couldn't wait to come back. Thank you.,Had to try this after seeing the article in Eater and This place knocked my socks off!  I really like a lot of middle eastern food and was excited to try this place out to shake up my WFH lunch rut.  I sometimes eat meat but mostly eat veggie for environmental/sustainability reasons.  The owner, Mohammad, greeted me and was available to discuss the menu and ingredients.  I tried the artichoke shawarma, which came with soup or salad; I selected the cauliflower, quinoa and lavender soup.  I added on a pear almond pastry that looked too tempting to leave behind.  The shawarma had so many layers, flavors and textures in a perfectly toasty wrap of generous size; it was like a music festival in my mouth (except without any of the lines for everything, rude people and crazy prices).  10 out of 10Flower flavors in food can be tricky, so my expectations were not very high for the cauliflower/quinoa/lavender soup.  My mild concern was entirely misplaced.  Another 10 out of 10.  The pastry looked beautiful but not necessarily extraordinary.  Wrong.  The pastry was very flaky and light.  Fillings were not overly sweet, gloppy, artificial.  The flavors were subtle and there was some mysterious element that will require my further investigation of this and other sweet options.When COVID challenges, supply chain and other pressures on restaurants; many places, old and new, have shorter menus, expanding prices and occasional gaps in quality or service; this lunch was 100% joy.  There is literally nothing I would change about this place.  Can't wait to go back.,We went because one of our party was vegetarian. The food would satisfy meat or dairy (food here is vegan) eaters as well. The menu offers a wide range of dishes which are indicated as ""tapas"" size for sharing (portions were adequate for that purpose). We tasted about 5 items; all were unique and flavorful due to the well considered spices and preparation. Based on our experience, we would definitely return. Please be aware this is a tasteful and spartan place. The staff were fantastic.,This place is amazing!! Their soup is the best. So fresh and yummy! Their food is so tasty! My family and I come here often. The owner is super friendly and welcoming. Their dessert (baklava) is best I have had!! My husband had a great decaf latte. They make food with love!!,So happy we found this restaurant. Very conveniently located close to UCSF hospital (4 blocks away)I had the trumpet burger and it was absolutely delicious, full of flavors! It came with a soup and that day was a broccoli soup, excellent. Mohammed (the owner?) was really nice and engaging. We will return!,Great addition to the Inner Sunset: A vegetarian Middle Eastern cafe!Savor is run by Mohamed Aboghanem (he used to run the well-respect, now closed, Saha Lounge restaurant downtown). Initially, the hours are 8 am to 3 pm for the rest of this month, and then 8 am to 8 pm beginning in June.,So delicious! The eggplant was amazing and everything was unique and freakin tasty!!!,Beware items on the menu noted as ""vegan"" are not really!!! My friend is lactose intolerant the type that get really bad rashes, he ordered an ""vegan"" item until he tasted cream.. The chef says the items are actually ""vegetarian-vegan""!! It's not right to falsely advertise food, that can be dangerous for some people!! Also crazy crazy expensive and tiny portions...,Thought of giving this a try because of the previous good reviews from others . But, the food and ambience were not good enough to explain the high prices and portions were extremely small. Service was fair given that they had only one person doing that. We will never go back though.,I love meat. When given the option, I will eat meat-centric entrees for nearly all of my meals. So please trust me when I say you need to come here even if you love meat, despite the heavy emphasis on (or was it exclusively?) vegetarian options. We came for dinner. The food was amazing. Both in quality as well as presentation.The interior is well done and comfy (RIP Martha's though). They also seemingly had some nice breakfast options that I'll have to come back to review. Our host was polite and gave us some amazing recommendations. Very well priced. Hopefully they'll have their liquor license soon!Overall highly recommended even if you don't fancy yourself a vegetarian.,Tried Savor for the first time the other night. Great food! Highly recommend the mushroom shawarma and trumpet mushroom burger. Was able to that to the owner, Mohamed, and he's doing a great job serving amazing food,Initially excited for a veggie/vegan restaurant. The food was very bland, save for the excessive use of garlic in the tzatziki. Phyllo dough, which is usually good, was overused and featured in three of the four dinner items, as well as the dessert. No contrast or taste in the dishes- no salt, tart, sweet, or umami flavors... just a slightly beany or daily vitamin vibe to the flavors fell flat. The dessert was the low point, a massive lump of undercooked phyllo, with little or no sweetness, no pistachios or nuts, honey seemed to not exist in any meaningful abundance. How do they mess up baklava? Oh also No alcohol, byob... so don't expect wine with your meal. Good service though. A smattering of old well to do Marin hippies inside made  it seem like I was transported to Fairfax, CA.,Excellent food!!!  Service was a little slow but efficient!!!  Address I thought was 41 Irving but was 401. But worth the confusion!!  Has its regulars so need to get there early,Savor offers delish food that just happens to be veg! My family and I come here often, and we have loved everything. Mo is just a genius when it comes to flavors and spices. Make a reservation for dinner if you can to guarantee a table. And BYOB/BYOW at the moment!,A contender for the best soup I've had in my life. The sandwich was delicious too. I highly recommend!,I'm not vegan or vegetarian, but this place makes killer food.   The owner, who is originally from Yemen, makes some really interesting dishes that you can't find anywhere else - all made from scratch.  We had the knaffe (think mushrooms in a cream sauce with phyllo dough) and the trumpet mushroom burger - both were amazing.,I ordered several vegetarian dishes for a BBQ that my boss was throwing for our team. HOLY MOLY! Every single thing was so delicious, SO flavorful. People cleaned out the vegetarian dishes and we had a ton of left over BBQ ribs and brisket. 3 people emailed me to ask where we got the vegetarian dishes from. Additionally, Mohammed is so dang nice and accommodating. I'd give this place 10 stars if I could.,I LOVE THIS PLACE! More importantly, I love Chef/Owner Mohamed. I have followed him now to three restaurants. Times have been tough - but he's still around making the BEST soups and sauces then you can believe. At Savor, he focuses mostly on vegan and vegetarian and everything is delicious and wonderful. As a fan, when I first went we tried it ALL. We loved it ALL. Even took home some desserts and pastries. If you're in the area and you want HIGH QUALITY and what is really too low of a price. GO HERE. If you just want your morning coffee fix, he's good for that too!!!,Savor is such a welcome addition to the neighborhood! I got the artichoke shawarma and the bread pudding. Both were fantastic. The shawarma was so flavorful and I did not miss the meat at all, plus side salad that came with it was perfectly seasoned. The owner asked if I wanted crème anglaise on the bread pudding - I mean, who wouldn't? It was perfection. The owner is very friendly and I'm excited to go back!,Such a gem...this is a cute neighborhood restaurant with gourmet food at a very fair price. I've been here twice and each time was so delicious. The trumpet mushroom ""burger"" is on a buttery roll that is like no other. And you get two small burgers. The homemade soup of the day was kale garbanzo bean- tasty and perfect on a cold day. To top it off, the owner runs the kitchen, takes orders, serves the food...all with a smile and warm hospitality. Please patronize this restaurant so it stays around! You're tummy will be happy.,Exceptional food!  And so nice to have a vegetarian / vegan cafe in the neighborhood.  Looking forward to trying more from their menu soon.,Absolutely delicious. I'm so happy I found this place. Everything we ordered was artfully and expertly crafted. Clean food. Fresh, healthy, amazing.I'm a meat eater and didn't miss it at all. Left feeling full, and grateful. Go before this place blows up and you can't get a table.,Delicious -- and that's coming from someone who usually loves meat. I had the House Falafel Sandwich which was so good that I came back for the Portobello Shawarma the next day. Mohamed is a super nice guy who takes clear pride in his food. Must try!!!,The malfoufa is superb. It's the most delicious potato tart I've ever had. The wild mushroom knaffe is so unique too. Their food is seasoned perfectly, so many flavors and textures!,A lovely new addition to the inner sunset! I've been in pretty consistently since the soft open and have loved everything I've tried thus far! DEFINITELY recommend the bread pudding, whenever they have it I buy at least two slices; it's my personal favorite item. Chef Mohamed and the other employees are so kind, and Savor is overall a great spot for a morning coffee or tasty lunch!,The Falafel sandwich was great!! I'll definitely be coming back to explore more of the menu.,Everything rocked! The marinated tofu dish is beyond. Shouting from the rooftops and recommending to everyone I know.,I'm a big fan of Savor: delicious and creative food, friendly vibes, relaxed atmosphere, convenient location, and pioneering executive chef, Mohamed. Excellent for vegans and plant-based eaters, as well as omnivores alike. I recommend basically everything. Sougar, lentil soup, potato and sage tart (!), baklava, etc. The food is elegantly presented and the flavors are dynamic--mixing cultures, ethnicities, and international flavors. And shout out to Mahamed, a pioneer in creative cuisine and of Saha fame. Recommended and enjoy!,It's organic and mostly vegan, and has dishes I can't find in SF like Yemeni molokhia leaf stew. Best vegan artichoke soup (soup of the day)! It tasted like it had mushrooms in it. But it didn't.I'd order all that and the malfoufa potato tart and tofu dishes again.The chef brought our food to us and sat for a minute to tell us why he always knew the last restaurant he'd create would be vegetarian and vegan. And the  pride in his food shows in his beautiful presentation.,We came to Savor in order to continue the great experiences we had at Saha---and were not disappointed!The menu is more casual befitting the café setting, sandwiches, salads and Shawarma. As an added attraction, everything is vegetarian, and mostly vegan, not that you will notice or care. It's all delicious! (And it's a great value for the quality.)Whether you are looking for a hearty lunch or coffee and pastries, there's a lot to enjoy! We made the trip from Glen Park, and this our new favorite ""neighborhood eatery"",This is an amazing find in SF!  The food was delicious, healthy and Very comforting.  Mohamed, the chef was kind and personable and recommended the Spanish Green Melt that was to die for!  They have vegetarian and vegan selections and it all looked terrific!  Highly recommend !,Amazing food, lovely employees.  Unassuming interior but the food could pull its in a Michelin restaurant.,100% amazing. We went for dinner and had the samosas (they're more like burekas or boregs), the mushroom knafe, the fatoush salad, and the dessert. Everything delicious. Service attentive but not fussy. Not a fancy place but very fancy food. Love having a solid vegan/veggie joint in the neighborhood.,Savor is a vegetable lover's dream come true. I came here for a celebratory dinner back in August when we ordered the beet salad, artichoke soup, quinoa cake tartare, potato & sage torte, and baklava for dessert. Everything was delicious but months later I'm still wondering how a green soup could taste that flavorful so that was definitely the highlight. I was too shy to properly say hi but Savor has a homey set-up; there's just the chef and the server, both of whom were beyond hospitable during our visit. Because it was just them there was a sort of relaxed energy to the dining experience that made it feel more like you were at your cool uncle chef's house for dinner and being served by your cousin than at a hustle-bustle restaurant. That's not the best way to describe it lol but a very unique memorable dinner, I definitely hope to visit again (maybe for lunch next time)! and recommend to all my friends studying nearby,I am a little reluctant to write a review because this superb restaurant is undiscovered and if word gets out, you will not be able to get a table. I went there with 2 friends who are picky eaters. We ordered different dishes including the sampler plate and loved absolutely everything. I returned last week for my birthday. I dislike beets and yet Mohamed recommended a beets dish that we ordered. It was delicious! We loved the mushroom dish and the eggplant dish. The bread pudding dessert was exceptional. Get to this restaurant while you can still get a table!,The food was so flavorful. I had the artichoke soup and it was like silk on a spoon and the flavor was so good. The mushroom Sharma was just the right flavor. The bread pudding was the perfect ending to a great meal. The prices were better than reasonable. I will keep coming back. You should too. I wish we had this in St. Louis.,Just love the food here Mohammed is creative, delightful and surprising on how he can squeeze wonderful and delicious Mediterranean and Yemeni vegetarian / vegan food from a tiny coffee shop. Sometimes with an Asian or French twist.  My family or just myself will stop by for coffee, pastry, or lunch and dinner more than once a week.Thanks! Chef Mo!!,What a wonderful addition to the neighborhood. We enjoyed the cappuccino and the pastry. We plan to try the stuffed beets and falafel. So nice to have a vegetable forward spot nearby.,This place is outstanding! We came for lunch on a Sunday, and had the asparagus soup (sooo good), green melt, falafel wrap, and bread pudding - everything was delicious, and I can't recommend this place enough (especially for all the vegetarians/vegans out there)! We're certainly going to be regulars!,I ordered for delivery the Savor Platter for $20 and was beyond disappointed. To begin with there were only tiny dollops of the various item that didn't fill up the compartments with two turd shaped falafels (were supposed to be 4) that were microscopic. It  looked nothing like the photo on line. And they were all tasteless. The falafel were soft with a tiny tiny smear of what I assume was tahini. This was by far the worst mixed middle eastern platter I have ever had in decades. And I've been eating Falafel, Babaganoush, and Hummus for decades. I also ordered the Fattoush Salad for $14.  The portion was generous, but the dressing was generically sweet and  acidic with no discrete or recognizable flavors of the various ingredients - olives, vegan feta, sumac, mint. And everything was soggy, including the lettuce, cucumbers - things that I expected to have a at least a little crunch. Didn't see any tomatoes. Pita bread was very thick and doughy. Was the regular chef was out to lunch somewhere else?,Great to have a foodie destination right in the Inner Sunset! Savor took over an old cafe and so the space is unassuming, but don't let that fool you. The food is on point! Bring your friends (omnivores will love this place as much as veg-heads).,Fantastic new place! We came here on Saturday and enjoyed a veggie croque monsieur and the green Spanish melt. They come with either soup or salad. I had the cauliflower lavender soup which was amazing. The flavors were absolutely divine! We can't wait to try other items on the menu. Savor is a great addition to the neighborhood.,I was a huge fan of Saha so was thrilled to see Savor open its doors. This is not your average Middle Eastern fare -- the dishes and flavors are familiar yet unique and beautifully spiced. The stuffed beets? LOVE. I also had the meze platter which was generous and made great leftovers too.  I can't wait to try everything on the menu.,I just had the most fantastic lunch there today.  Incredible quality, very delicious food.  Ordered the Green Spinach Melt and the Falafel wrap and both were served with a delicious Arugula salad.  Even had some of the desert items, absolutely delicious.  Overjoyed we have a new restaurant in the neighborhood serving very high quality breakfast and lunch!,Mohamed Aboghanem is on fire! Savor is a cute little place with a very amiable server, and the food is inventive, flavorful, and beautifully presented. I loved Saha when it was in San Francisco years ago.

Saha's food didn't quite do it for me, but Savor is a home run. My favorite dish tonight was the potato and sage torte, followed closely by the fennel baklava.  Jackfruit samosas were also good. We enjoyed a creamy dessert, not sure what it was called, and a couple of lattes to finish the meal. We'll definitely be back!,Both portobello and artichoke shawarmas were amazing! Chocolate Brownie was great too. Highly rec,Delicious beet salad. Beautiful presentation. Friendly service. We highly recommend Savor.,So glad to have found Chef Mohammed in the kitchen again. After spending time at the Cal Academy and Botanical Gardens we happened upon Savor for dinner last Friday. Once I saw Mo behind the bar, I knew I was in for a treat. Mushroom Pate is to die for as always, but I think the artichoke dip on the savor platter was this nights highlight. True to the name, every dish made me stop and consider all the complex flavors. You can't help but savor the experience.,So good! You won't believe it's Vegan! Tasty and affordable, glad to have this healthy option.,Outstanding. Simply outstanding. Several Vegan options. Clean and healthy food. Great customer service. Every dish we ordered was on point and I will definitely recommend to others.,Phenomenal vegan and vegetarian Yemeni inspired dishes. Get the vegan breakfast burrito, even non vegans like it. The wild mushroom knaffe is a filo stuffed pastry like none elsewhere in the city.  Conveniently located on Irving right by the n Judah stop, it has lots of seating, great service, and delicious espresso drinks.,"Amazing! So happy to have this place in the neighborhood! Artichoke Shwarma is especially good.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Starbelly,"Starbelly is a neighborhood gem that needs to be a part of everyone's regular rotation. It's a great option for a weeknight burger and fries, but the star for me is when you have a weeknight pizza craving. The bacon pizza is so scrumptious. The crispy crust with melty cheese and crisp bacon is a combo to salivate over. The arugula adds a nice peppery touch. This specific night I decided to try the Toffee Cake, and added a scoop of the seasonal ice cream, which was the Chocolate Caramel Crackle--the two together was AMAZING. I'm going back just for that dessert combo.,I'm here for the beautiful cocktails, easy atmosphere, minimal lines for weekday brunch, the amazing blonde waitress that made our day and simple California-style menu :-)Perfect place for catch up time with your friends, beautiful outdoor covered area / sunroom. Just gives you a happy feel good vibe and their menu served perfect portions for a table for 2,One of my favorite places in San Francisco to have delicious & beautiful food with wonderful cocktails. My go to is the house made pate - decadent, white bean dip - beautiful, fries with 3 dips - LOVE (goes so well with a martini) and wonderful Starbelly salad. Although the pizzas are phenomenal there too.The service is on point- upbeat, and very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu.Had the newest cocktail -Passionflower: tequila and passion fruit. I tend to order a vodka martini, but this sounded so amazing.! And it was so yummy. I'll add more to my review the next time I go. I just go so often that, silly me, forgot to give them the a great review ;),Made reservations for Wednesday brunch at 11:30, upon arriving we were seated promptly. Inside of the restaurant was pretty vacant but the patio in the back was full. Food: Challah French Toast - great sweet brunch option, two large slices of custardy french toast serve with strawberry conserve, mascarpone and pistachios, not too sweet and surprisingly light definitely worth ordering if you're looking for something sweetButternut squash pizza - a really interesting combo of flavors, base was a pesto along with black garlic, ricotta salata, pepitas and butternut squash, crust was good, crisp and chewy, a bit on the greasy end but over pretty tasty Bibb lettuce salad - tasty, salad was probably dressed, and well seasoned, bacon was crisp, chicken was well grilled, overall a very good classic saladFries - thin and fried crisp, my preferred style, can't go wrong,  thoroughly enjoyed the trio of sauces that came with them Service was good, no complaints, were offered water and coffee refills when needed. Overall one of my favorite spots in the city for an affordable brunch or dinner. Food is always dependably good, drinks are reasonably priced and the menu maintains a good balance of classic dishes along with interesting seasonal offerings.,Good place if you want a cheap restaurant (we spend 60$ in 3) or an easy reservation. Speaking of the food, they have basic dishes. The quality is ok, not something very outstanding but you can easily enjoy. The ambiance is nice and the service is pretty fast and efficient.,Had a reservation for 2 on a Sunday night at 5:30, plenty of space, so I was seated immediately. The space has a really nice dimmed lighting, creating a great intimate space for small groups. Ordered the broccoli rapini, flavor was great but a bit salty and extremely oily. Asked for half vegan cheese on the pizza and they accommodated! It was really good, crispy and thin crust just how I like it! Managed to finish all of it with 2 people. Although I just realized that the arugula we ordered did not get added on top of the pizza and I forgot to mention it since we were so hungry! Regardless it was a pleasant experience and appreciated them for catering to my sensitive stomach!,Weekend brunch is where it's at! I have a sensitive stomach and always order the chilaquiles, which are perfectly seasoned without being too heavy or salty. Good mix of chips, chorizo, egg, salsa. The side salad and avocado help balance everything out. I've also been here for lunch and dinner multiple times. Pizza is hit or miss, skip the fried chicken. They seem to always have space available for two people to walk in, but for larger groups definitely reserve. The back patio is covered so it's not windy but still has ventilation. Bonus: there's an option to use the InKind app to pay, which is completely contactless and you don't have to wait for the server.,GREAT brunch spot especially with a bigger group!  The restaurant was very spacious and saw they were able to accommodate larger parties. The three of us decided to split several dishes and none of them disappointed. My favorite was the margherita pizza,Came for dinner with a group of friends and we shared a few dishes! We started with fried, pate and cauliflower. It was all sooo delicious and loved how unique the food was.For mains, we shared two pizzas that were both amazing! It was just enough food for the 5 of us where we were satisfied but think we could have eaten one more large dish like a pizza to be properly full,Dinner before a movie brought us to Starbelly for an early dinner. We were seated inside at a high-table. Started with the chicken liver pate. It was good but somehow it lacked flavor!! I am a Pate lover and it just didn't leave the greatest impression. My salad was good, and my husband enjoyed his burger. The burger and salad were both in the small side!!  Entrees tasted good but nothing was a standout.,Tasty fried chicken sandwich, I like things saucy and would have preferred more slaw. Bun was good. Fries reminded me of In N Out. Wish they remembered the aioli for my takeout order. Not crowded at lunch.,Came here after doing Barry's Bootcamp so this was super conveniently close and lots of reservations were available. Good:- Loved the cauliflower soup - so much flavor packed into each bowl- Fan of the Star bacon pizza - I liked the tomato sauce and bacon combo and it was good even though I'm not usually a fan of arugula - I liked the loco moco - definitely on the smaller side but the medium rare loco moco was tasty and left me wanting more - The freshly squeezed orange juice was heavenly - started drinking it and couldn't stop! - Upscale modern ambiance Bad: - The butternut squash didn't work as well for me - I didn't like the combo of flavors very much and the cheese didn't really sit right for me either Overall very high quality place and great for dates - we came for a double date and would come back - reasonable prices too.,Came for an early Sunday brunch, easily secured a table for 2 around 11am but the place definitely seems to fill up as time goes by.The inside is real nice, spacious and bright. There is a patio where you can sit with your dog, as well as seats in the front. Inside was fine, although it got pretty loud once more people arrived adjacent to our table.The menu isn't as expensive as other brunch spots, but still has some fun stuff on it. Win! I got the Chilaquiles and a coffee, my vegetarian companion got the Italian eggs with a side of fruit. I didn't see any fancier coffee options, so I would double check with them if that's what you're into.The food was solid - good, but not mind blowing. It hit the spot for a casual brunch. What lacked -the chilaquiles, while tasty, felt a bit one note and could have used some more heat or zest. House made chorizo didn't stand out that much, I guess. The fruit side was a bit worse for wear, although I understand it's not the season for lots of brunch fruit. I am lowkey suspecting my coffee might have been part decaf, or maybe it was watered down? Didn't feel very strong. Maybe will go for some alcohol next time instead.Again, good for casual brunch - I wouldn't bring a foodie with expectations, but great vibes, friendly prices (for SF) and ambience if you're getting brunch to be social.,Easy to get a table for Sunday brunch. There is parklet seating and a huge backyard seating for outdoors then inside tables and a bar as well.Chilaquiles were a good portion and tasty. Would have been better with more spice or a salsa. Side salad was mildly dressed and nice to have greens with the meal.Lychee cocktail was pleasant but I wish there was more flavor to it. Lychee itself was light and overpowered by the lemon. Definitely a lot of create cocktails I look forward to trying in the future,We came here for my coworkers bday, and it was great vibes all around.We ordered a lot, and we spent $89/person for about 13 people. We ordered hella appetizers, including fries and more but I ordered the burger, which was very solid with the melted cheese.Would def come back and try ordering less because I was just too stuffed,The service was very nice. The waiters were friendly. The butternut squash pizza is a 10 out of 10 I would highly recommend. Very flavorful and unique. The crust was thin, but nicely crunchy. The chicken Po boy sandwich was very good. They set a lot of fries. Had some left over but finished it. You have to order the fries separately though. I think it's like two bucks, but it was worth it couldn't hear the waiter though he is very soft. outdoor seating heater was on. Very modern very San Francisco.,This place just keeps getting better.The bar menu is wonderful, so many creative concoctions. The food menu covers all the bases, small to medium to large to ginormous, as in pizza for 1. Great service, attentive and helpful.One of the best in the 'hood.Enjoy!,Came here for SF Restaurant Week 2022! The lunch comes with a starter and an entree for $15! What a DEAL. I ordered the 1/2 liver pate plate and chicken po'boy. The pate was a great deal - it came with a toasted piece of bread, pate, jam, and mustard. I should have ordered another slice of bread! The chicken po'boy was a good size and chicken had a tasty flavor but the slaw was a little bitter to me! Stop a great meal for $15!,Love this place! For a a great spaghetti (all of their other dishes are good but the spaghetti is my absolute favorite!) and a nice spot to go on your own, with friends or family this place does not disappoint.,The ambiance of the restaurant is very cute and the staff were super friendly. I ordered the lavender lemonade and the chicken & waffles for brunch. The lemonade was a bit bitter and I could not really taste the lavender. The waffles were light and fluffy and had syrup already soaked into them which tasted so good. I was not a fan of the chicken. It was a bit rubbery which grossed me out. Parking is a bit of a pain around here too, alas welcome to the city.,Appetizers and pizzas were really solid. The bangers and mash was undercooked the first time with a significant amount of pink left in the sausage. The second plate they brought had less pink but was still visible. After sending the food back a second time, the manager came out and agreed to comp our appetizers, but was defensive on the coloring of the sausage. Highlighting that it is fully cooked despite the color, and it's made in house. However, a friend who got the same dish as me had no visible pink coloring in theirs.,Starbelly gets 5 stars from my belly. Every dish I had was satisfying. I will drive to SF from Vallejo just to eat here again. The staff was friendly and accommodating and attentive. The interior was cute and they have outdoor dining in the front and in the back with heat lamps if you're concerned about COVID like me. But back to the food and drinks. We had the Dungeness  crab & garlic with squid ink noodles, fries, a star belly salad, Margherita pizza, and a lychee blossom cocktail--and all of it was devoured with nothing left to take home.  Parking was easy on a Saturday night also. Thank you for great service and food made with love.,This simple rustic restaurant is full of energy and good vibe. It has a semi-open kitchen, so you can see all the actions when the food is prepared, and it also has a back-yard under a tent like a German style beer garden. The food is very savory and tasty but not overly heavy. The service is great in that the attentive staff is always there when you need them, and makes excellent recommendations, but they'll leave you alone to enjoy the food, when you don't need them. Overall, we love this restaurant and will definitely come back.,This is such a neighborhood standby. We've been coming here for years, even before we moved to this area. It's easy to get reservations, the food (chicken liver pate with that bread!) and cocktails are always good. They have quite a bit of seating thru their deep restaurant, including the lovely back patio! We've brought friends and family here, and it's always a hit. Easy pick.,This place is pure magic..how the tiny kitchen and small staff are able to accommodate such a huge space is beyond me. The chill severs and relaxed vibe make this a neighborhood go to. The dishes are simple and oh so comforting. The menu changes seasonally but there are staples that you can always count on being there...the fresh spaghetti, pizzas and burgers are popular favorites, and every iteration of the decadent dumplings are a must try. This is one of the few places you can go in the winter and sit outside and really be cozy. The wide selection of tables/ atmospheres means there's a place that everyone will love. The back patio is either fully or partially covered, giving you the experience of being outside but with the warmth of huge heat lamps. I've found it's actually sometimes warmer there in the winter months than inside even. It's also the most happening section in the whole place. I've heard you can rent it out for private events and I can't wait to plan a party there. The parklet tables on the street are like your own private oasis..warm to the point where you'll shed your jacket even on the coldest nights. Inside offers both high top tables, standard seating and a huge communal table. Spots at the bar are great for cocktails and convo with their fun and friendly bartenders. It's very easy to get a reservation and they almost always are able to accommodate walk ins. Parking can be a bit challenging in that hood..but a couple spins around the block usually lands you a spot. I've never had brunch there but the dinner experience is fabulous. You'll find yourself being a regular there for sure :),Went here for brunch and sat outside.Pros: cute venue and walkable from our hotelCons: While we were seated quickly, it took over 10min for a waiter to stop by our table with water.A leaf fell out of our water pitcher while we were pouring water - it was clearly not something that was intentionally added to the drinkFood was delivered BEFORE our drinks - also the warm drinks were cold. Food was COLD This was my experience - I'm sharing because of how notably unfortunate it was and how disappointed I am - I was really looking forward to my French toast and waffles,Super cozy spot in the Castro area! The small plates were particularly good -- I really liked the potato dumplings. The pizza was alright, but next time I think I'd order more of the sharing plates!Dined: June 29, 2022,Mission Fig Pizza: figs, arugula, serrano ham and manchego cheese. Pretty good but just a little dry. Could've used some balsamic glaze or something. Chicken and waffles: chicken was just okayLoco Moco: one of the highlights of the meal but also small portionedPo Boy: loved the fries, slaw was good, chicken was okay Honestly thought the food was just okay, nothing super memorable. I liked the pizza the most but honestly wish there was a glaze on it because it was kind of dry.Service: sitting outside, we had a hard time getting the server's attention. Reservations: super easy to make through YelpDrinks: mimosas with grapefruit or orange juice, nice and refreshing,Probably should have made reservations on a Sunday evening, but thankfully, some seats opened up at the bar and they were able to seat us pretty quickly. We had the chicken liver pâté, which was out-of-this-world! That grilled bread was so good all on its own and paired with the pâté, fresh mustard seeds, and jam/jelly on the side just knocked it out of the park. The Starbelly bacon pizza just elevated the experience even further. The bacon with the arugula, jalapenos and that green goddess sauce (OMG) was the perfect blend of savory, bitter, spicy, and tangy. It looks like they change up their menus seasonally, so I'm long overdue for another visit. Until then!,Restaurant week 10/21 to 10/30/22 yay! Starbelly my favorite choice but only Monday to Friday.  $15 lunch.  I love their pate which is half an order of their regular menu.  It is enough!  Love the jam with the pate.  The po boy fried chicken was excellent.  Got too gung ho and burned the roof of my mouth.  There's only limited time to get back to work.  Rushy rushy.  Big yum.,Came here before a show at Castro Theater and had some really yummy pizza! There's a nice covered back patio area filled with beautiful plants which made for a great ambiance. We were told our table was limited to 1 hr 15 min, but I don't remember if they actually enforced that. I was happy to see there was a corn pizza, and it was enough to have leftovers for later! Also if you haven't tried corn on pizza yet that's something you NEED to try,The food was delicious and the service excellent. Everyone was very welcoming and friendly,On our weekly date night, we decided to grab some dinner at Starbelly as it's always a great choice when dining in the Castro. Located on one of the busiest intersections, it's super accessible. I love the space! Lots of options for dining - outside seating in the front and the back patio, bar and high top seating, and a proper in-house dining area for tables. There's a climate and seat preference for everyone. The menu is seasonal and packed with locally sourced ingredients. Here's what we got off the winter dinner menu 2022: - Rose of Pinot Noir - Latransa for $48 a bottle- House-made chicken liver pate for $12. It's on a board with bread, sweet onion marmalade, and grain mustard. I love a good charcuterie board with different items; this was great! I also love that they bring more bread upon request- Grilled bavette steak for $30. While it comes with potato puree, we opted to get the french fries instead. The place also included crispy brussels sprouts and garlic porcini butter. So good! Love the flavors and am glad we got the fries! As mentioned, Starbelly is always a great place and option while visiting the Castro. Great food always!,Let me just say, their Starbelly bacon pizza was EVERYTHING. Whatever the green goddess dressing that was on the pizza was spectacular! ($17)Their house-made chicken liver pâté was so delicious. The amount of pâté they gave you was so generous, we had to get extra buttered bread to finish it off! It also came with a side of sweet onion marmalade and green mustard. ($12)For their spring menu, they are currently serving house-made andouille sausage and gulf prawns w/ wild rice, okra and sweet peppers. (1 big sausage and 4 prawns) It had a medley of everything and I thoroughly enjoyed it! ($28) Both cocktails were great. We got the strawberry alarm clock and a banana drink that i unfortunately forgot what's it called! ($11-13)I will be back!,This small, and relaxed atmosphere restaurant is presented on a bustling 4 corner section in the Mission district.  You will notice wine bottles crisscrossed in the windows as you walk up, which was a marker for me, and super cool.  The service is top notch.  We were greeted, and received caring service throughout the meal by thoughtful staff.  And be prepared to be presented a small double page menu that packs a great selection of delicious food, and drink options.  Seriously, everything was amazing, and we are going back today!  You are given the choice of bubbly or still water, had to go with the complimentary bubbly water, because bubbles.  We started with the bean puree dish, and the marinated olives which had a delicate flavor of star anise which was surprisingly good. The puree bean dish had alot of flavor between the white bean puree, and the slightly pickled tasting veggies.  I want to go back for that dish alone.  I ordered a salty dog, and it tasted fresh like pressed grapefruit.  The best salty dog I have ever had hands down.  My husband ordered the Margherita pizza with vegan cheese, and ate the entire pizza but let me have a few bites of a slice.  It was a light, thin crust, and very fresh tasting ingredients.  Not the out of a tin can tasting sauce you are typically presented with.  I had the house made bangers, and mash.  That is the best bangers I have had outside of Europe, and I am already craving this dish again.  I ordered the toffee cake to go.  It comes with heavy cream, and candied figs.  I enjoyed it back at the hotel with a brandy sitting in front of the fireplace.  A perfecf dessert to end a perfect dinner.  If your in the area,  do yourself a favor and stop in for a memorable evening.,Always fantastic !! Food , service , drinks are great !! The seasons and mock tails ( for Dry Jan) are also great,Five stars for service... everyone who works here is super nice and the service is great. The location is great and the restaurant has a cool vibe. Now the big problem is the food is boring and not that flavourful. And ask any of my friends when I sit down I am going to say, ""they still haven't changed the menu."" I love this restaurant group so much I love delarossi and a mano but why is starbelly so star-boring? Even their pizza is dry and lacklustre.... Maybe for non-vegetarian there are some good options but their veggie burger is dry and boring. I try to talk my friends out of going there when they choose it...,Really good spot in the Castro. Good food and decently priced! Pretty hopping place so reservations are good to make. Service is good as well.,Looking for a last minute dinner reservation and I was happy to be able to come here. The staff is great and the service is really fast.  We decided to share several small plates and one main entree.  The burrata was good but the bread was too soft.  The pate was really good.  The lamb meatballs were delicious.  The starbelly salad was good but slightly overdressed.  Finished up with the shrimp and andouille sausage and rice with okra.  This was all really good. The okra was cooked nice which isn't always easy to do.  It had a great taste overall and although super buttery it was so good.  Overall it's a nice place and I would go back if I lived here.,Such great food and our server was very personable! I loved their pasta. Great place to catch up with friends.,Star belly is super cute inside and has a really pretty back patio to sit on! Going for lunch is the best time to sit out as it is warm but usually not windy. The fried chicken po boy and the shrimp tacos were great, as well as the pate appetiser (if you like pate). The date and toffee cake that they have is also super yummy, it is definitely worth stopping here for lunch if you're in the Castro!,Starbelly is a casual restaurant in the Castro. We came here for brunch on a weekend and it was surprisingly not packed and we didn't have to wait to be seated. Do note that they take reservations by phone if you have a larger party.The brunch menu has classic American brunch dishes with some more unique options. The Fried Chicken & Waffles has to be my favorite. It comes with two large portions of flavorful and crispy fried chicken sandwiched between fluffy buttermilk waffles. It's flavorful and filling. The farmhouse eggs with potatoes and bacon is also a good option. Their potatoes and bacon are very crispy, which I enjoyed.The venue was cute and spacious. The service could have been a bit better, however. We received the incorrect order and it took a bit for it to be corrected. The food was then sent to another table rather than being discarded. The check also took a while to receive.,Wonderful place, such a gem I hope to be back next time in San Fran. Amazing service, friendly staff, delicious food, beautiful atmosphere, and string drinks. What more could you ask for?! I loved the decor and the vibes the food was so good too! I can't recommend this place enough.,I just came here about two weekends ago for Saturday Brunch. I have gone here prior for dinner with friends. But, it actually was a 4 star experience. I think the reason for the 5 is because of the service.The brunch drinks are delicious. I had a strawberry drink that was pretty strong and we all ordered them. As far as food this is what we indulged:- Pizza with Bacon and sausage- Chorizo Chilaquiles-- these were okay nothing to die for, I would probably get the pizza for myself next time.- My friend had the 2 farmhouse eggs, potatoes and a breakfast sausage.Overall it was a good experience because of their outside area and the service was spectacular. :),A very unremarkable brunch! Not bad, but not great, so a solid 3. The marguerita pizza was hard on the bottom and chewy on top. The chicken and waffles was just fine, the chicken was pretty crispy on the outside. I enjoyed the salty dog cocktail. Nice elderflower flavor comes through and pairs well w/ the gin and grapefruit. The tea for two was bitter, would not reorder. Service was good. There is seating on the front and back patio, and inside in the main dining area.,This great restaurant has: Astounding service.....Delicious food....eclectic patio space and park let seating....and marvelous creation cocktails.  My husband and I drove from Petaluma to have a pre-holiday lunch with our daughters.  They seated the girls right away even though we were a bit late and, I really appreciate this small cordial touch.The menu has an array of temptations for your pallet...f salads, pate, pizzas, home made chorizo, breakfast lunch and more. The cocktails are on the back of the menu. Do not miss out. My husband snd I split the Fried Chicken Po boy with Spicy slaw and, corn meal crusted fish tacos with slaw that melts in your mouth. Both come with pickled jalapeños too.  Our girls ordered the pork belly sauced pasta and a burger.Best of all......we ordered a group basket of their fries....do not miss the fries . This comes with 3 dipping sauces.  I'm so impressed. Every bite was a burst of flavor. The burger and the chicken came on challah buns. This is so smart.  I am Super impressed. We all were. The only suggestion we have is, please move the tables apart.  We were really close to a lot of people. I know the vaccines were checked but, with new virus....not comfortable completely,Great neighborhood restaurant to get a bite to eat. Try the pizza try different specialty menus does get kind of crowded make sure make reservations. If not, you can walk in his wish. The tears were a little more comfortable services. Good I would recommend this place to anyone visiting and to change it up a bit.,Starbelly is pretty cool! We began our meal with cocktails. My gf ordered the Strawberry Alarm Clock and I asked the waiter if they could make me something with Scotch, and they brought me Penicillin (the cocktail, not the antibiotic). Both were on point - and I was especially pleased with the Penicillin because this was not on the menu (but the waiter was correct that they had great bartenders ay Starbelly).For appetizers, we shared garlic fries and sweet potato dumplings. Also on point. Fries were hot and sufficiently garlicky, and unlike what appears to be popular at most restaurants, these were thicker fries (almost steak fries) that nonetheless maintained a slight crisp (without being crunchy) - anyway, they were above average. The dumplings were magic, savory and smooth with a touch of sweetness and great mouthfeel.I ordered a steak and my gf ordered a burger. My steak was good, if a bit more cooked than I wanted (I asked for medium-rare, and it was on the well done side of medium). The mashed potatoes that came with it were smooth as silk and tasted wonderful and the brussels made for an excellent sidekick. The burger was solid. As for non-edibles, the wait staff was lovely and the space is great. We sat inside, which had light and tasteful holiday decorations, but the patio looked cool, too. We hope to come back for brunch sometime.,Came here for brunch with my bestie since a nearby brunch spot that we originally wanted to go to had an almost 1 hour wait. SO glad we came here instead! The vibes were amazing - beautiful decor, friendly staff, and plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Didn't need a reservation to sit inside since they had space (it was a Saturday, late morning), though I've heard it can get  busy..maybe we were just super lucky. I ordered the chilaquiles which came with a yummy salad and half of an avocado - loved it! My friend got the margarita pizza which was also delicious. Food was really vibrant and flavors were amazing. Totally recommend checking this spot out!,I love their spaghetti! Probably the best spaghetti I have ever had. The perfect amount of spice, flavor, and sauce. I really enjoyed the bacon, it feels more like thin cuts of pork-belly lol.  The only problem is that I wish I had more! This should be enough to get you coming thought the doors. I also lucky ordered their fries as an app (I know carbie barbie), but it was worth it! Three dipping sauces all good, maybe adding another exotic sauce? Not needed, but would be appreciated. Parking is a bit hard over here, but make the trip, you'll like it!,You have to love this busy restaurant. You can choose to sit at the communal table or at a high top table for two. The food is outstanding - especially the pate and the pizzas. The choices are hand prepared, earthy and prepared with the highest quality ingredients.We over ordered from the mini dishes, but were happy with every selection.,I really really wanted to like this place, but unfortunately it didn't hit the spot, or maybe it was an off night? My friends and I got the fries, potato dumplings, Brussels sprouts, chorizo pizza; and the spaghetti. The fries came unseasoned and also a little cold, and the sauces were nothing too special. The potato dumplings were decent, but a little too much cheese for someone like myself (not necessarily a bad problem to have). The Brussels sprouts came overly burnt as well. The chorizo pizza wasn't anything special, but the spaghetti was okay. Overall, disappointing due to the amount of good reviews they have, and the cocktails were also mid.,Great Brunch here on the patio.  We shared the fried chicken sandwich and the pizza with sausage.  The pizza was great and loved the thin crust.     The poi boy sandwich was equally terrific and the brunch cocktails were perfect.,This has become one of our favorite restaurants in San Francisco.  Besides the food being excellent - we love the white bean purée, as well as the pasta appetizers....   and steak for main entree - the service is great.  The service here is top notch.  It hasn't mattered who is our server, this is an extremely well run restaurant.  Orders go in and food comes out pretty quickly.  Someone is always checking on your table and proactively refilling water, etc.  Its clearly a well orchestrated team effort rather than one person doing everything for your table, and it works well. Last time we went we tried out the back patio.  It was much quieter than the main restaurant and still had decent airflow but with heat lamps.   Very pleasant.  We got there at 530 pm and there was hardly anyone there.   By the time we left, it was about half full but I know this location gets much busier around 7.,First time at Starbelly was an experience that I could only describe as delightful. Atmosphere was lovely on the back patio with music at a perfect volume so conversations wouldn't get lost, and it was very well shaded. I had the white sangria and the fried chicken po'boy off the summer brunch menu. The sandwich and fries were divine, but unfortunately, the sangria was nothing to phone home about. It could've used some more cut fruit and a fuller flavor palate. But overall, everything was very good! Service was great and we were there for a friend's birthday so they gave her a dessert with a candle...so cute. I'd highly recommend Starbelly if you're looking for a chill brunch spot!,Have been here a few times and have enjoyed each experience. The starbelly bacon pizza and house cut fries are a staple. While I normally don't order desserts, I've had a few here and very much enjoyed them. Depending on the day and time, the noise levels can get a bit high. Just something to be mindful of depending on occasion.,I'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e heard about this place for a while now, but hadn't been able to make it yet. Finally got to go there on New Year's Day. Not only is the vibe definitely positive, but the staff and food are great. I got the chicken and waffles for brunch, and I have to be honest that it was quite amazing. I'm pretty picky about my chicken as well. Definitely will be going back!,The food at Starbelly is hella yummy !!!I love  eating the fries, margherita pizza, and the bolognese spaghetti  with jalapeños and bacon !!!,Came here for a team dinner that was very well organized! We were able to customize a set menu ahead of time and the food came out at a nice pace.FOOD- Pizza margherita: simple and yummy- House cut fries with three dips: particularly tasty because we were so hungry lol. My coworkers and I couldn't figure out what the green dip was but it was yummy- Fresh spaghetti: simple and tasty! Spaghetti was cooked to perfect al-dente texture- Seared Ahi tuna: Loved the crispy broccoli di ciccio. The ahi tuna itself was a bit overcooked which was a bit disappointing- Salted caramel pot de creme: surprisingly very tasty given that I don't like caramel. The cornmeal-rosemary cookies were a huge hit across the team-  Chocolate toffee cake with dates and mascarpone: also very delicious!DRINKSOur team had a good selection of wine. We also ordered a variety of cocktails which all looked pretty. I tried the Salty Dog which had all the flavors I like and was perfect for me.Overall, good venue for a team event. Food is simple but tasty and it was pretty busy on a Tuesday evening.,YUM! I tried this place for SF restaurant week and fell in love. The ambiance is amazing and their outdoor patio is very cute. The servers are friendly and attentive, and the food was delicious! My favorite dish had to be the cauliflower soup -- it was so creamy and AMAZING. All of the food tastes very light and clean. I was in awe of how they managed to make every taste so good without it feeling too oily or unhealthy like many restaurants do. This place is a great spot for a date or quick lunch break during work!,Starbelly has remained good and consistent over the years. We had a nice frito misto to start which was a pleasant surprise with cornmeal in place of traditional coating/batter. The fig and Parma ham pizza and baby kale caesar salad was so fresh and tasty. Finished off with the warm toffee cake and pot de creme, both of which were incredible (still)....Happy to ssee a restaurant coming out of the pandemic staying consistently good....good service, tasty food, and great value.,Walked in here to get brunch on a Sunday, and ended up waiting for about half an hour, which was decent given the popularity of this place.We ordered a couple cocktails to begin with, and they came out p quick. Taste was a solid 7/10 on both.Next we got the fish tacos, french toast and a dish called the loco moco, which is essentially a beef patty topped with a runny egg.The fish tacos were crunchy, fatty, and made helluva brunch. The french toast tasted super satisfying, but the amount of calories on that plate, my god. The loco moco was a good balance, and the patty was cooked as I had asked for, the egg had a nice mouthfeel, and the rice made it a complete dish.The portion sizes on each was good, and is enough for an adult, unless you go splitsies. The waitstaff was warm and the ambience was very welcoming. Definitely a go-go!10/10 would go back again!,I went to Starbelly with my friend on Sunday at 2pm so there was no wait and the food was delicious! Ask to sit in the back patio. It is covered but has nice, fresh air and a welcoming atmosphere. We ordered the lychee drink and the berry margarita. Both were very good and would highly recommend getting the margarita! For food we ordered the arugula bacon starbelly pizza, fish tacos, and a side of fries. I highly recommend getting a pizza here and was even great as leftovers the next day. Overall, great food, cocktails, and the staff were very nice and friendly. I will be back again,Came with a group for dinner and ordered the Citrus Salad and Bavette Steak (subbed the potato purée for fries) -- both were very good. Loved the crispy brussels! Service was prompt and atmosphere was lively.,I've been to Starbelly for both dinner and brunch and, while the food was good both times, I'd recommend going for dinner! The pate and bread, fries, burrata, and butternut squash dumplings were all so tasty. Make reservations or go early if you can, especially if you want to sit in the cute, airy back patio.,My girlfriends and I been wanting to try them for brunch.  We opted for outdoor seating and they had our table ready!  Yay for a heater overhead since SF weather can be so unpredictable.  We always order to share, and today, we had:sunnyside joe's, lost coast ground beef, cheddar, onions & spinach, potatoeschallah French toast, market fruit conserve, mascarpone & pistachiobuttermilk fried chicken & waffles, maple syrupstarbelly salad with leaf lettuce, goat cheese, cherry tomatoes, salt & pepper vinaigrettePizza: grilled summer corn, aged white cheddar, Aleppo chile, lime aioli & cilantroEVERYTHING was good.  The pizza was a nice surprise.  We also really liked sunnyside joe's.  Service was prompt and the staff came to check on us a few times.,Let me just start by saying that this place absolutely lives up to its hype!! We came on a weekend night and were miraculously able to get seated shortly after arriving (we opted for outside/patio seating and the heaters kept us warm). We ordered dumplings for the table; however, the restaurant ran out. The manager came and apologized and proceeded to provide us with 2 free appetizers instead. One of the apps was I believe garlic broccoli. Personally, I very much so dislike broccoli, but holy molyyyy, I'm not sure how the chef prepared this dish but it was the best broccoli I have tasted in my life! My main course was the seared tuna and that did not disappoint either. Pair that with a delicious drink and I was set for the night. Thoroughly impressed with the food and even more so with the excellent service! Also, if you plan on continuing the night with more drinking, the restaurant is walking distance from a whole bunch of bars!,I ordered the fish tacos and you can add on fries or a salad for $2 more. In general, the food was very well priced considering there were only two tacos. In SF, you should always expect your brunch to be at least $25 including tax and tip. My meal with the fries add-on was around $19 including tax and tip. The breading on the fish was good and there was decent amount of fish. The only issue I had was that the food took a very very long time to come out. The kitchen is pretty small for the amount of seating they had. So just be aware that you may have to wait a while for your food to come out. We wanted for 45 mins.,What's the place to go? Starbelly! Until tonight. My partner and I have a reservation for 9:45pm. Due to a street closure caused by a motorcycle and car accident, we are forced to take a minor detour. We park, walk to Starbelly to get our usual menu items and drinks. We get to the entrance and the host says they're closed. We both say we have a 9:45 reservation (see image one). One very unfriendly male at the bar gives us attitude and says," """"it's 9:53"," the kitchen is closed"""". We tell him we have a 9:45 reservation", how is the kitchen closed? There's even a 10:00pm reservation available (see image two). Doesn't make sense. They just won't sit us and the unfriendly customer service was just unacceptable and didn't expect it from Starbelly staff. Every time I'm here, it's the best customer service but tonight, this one individual was very dismissive and rude. I understand it's the end of your shift and you want to go home (more like go out for this one person) but treat your patrons with respect and honor their reservation. If the kitchen closes at a certain time, the system should reflect that. I'm sorry but this was our last time at Starbelly.,TL;DR - Good space for brunch with plenty of seating in the patio (back is better than the front) and lots of open space inside.Get the pizza and chicken liver/pate here, they're the best thing on the menu. Any of the pizza will do, it's all good. Both of these are easy to eat and share. The pate was divine, really, I could've just eaten that.The burger was disappointing, the description and name of the burger made it out to be better than it actually was. Overall, good service, great space, some menu items are better than most.,Once was great and now mediocre at best:Pizza soggy and bland;Mussels small number and many unopenedServer unfamiliar with menuOverpriced for what it isFir pizza delfina much betterAnother example of a restaurant that never opened correctly after pandemix,Love that they have vegan cheese for pizzas. Something here for everyone. Amazing salmon entree, great wine and cocktails. Back garden patio has the best ambiance, inside is a bit loud.,Really fun and open vibe in the Castro area. We started with the. White bean purée and a couple of cocktails. Our server was training, but there is a team service vibe here. You will it not be waiting long for anything. Everyone is there to serve, but you also have a contact person We had a great time and our food was really good. If something caches your eye, go ahead and order it. You will not be disappointed.,I love eating here. Especially post pandemic. Because there is out front, inside and outside porch seating.The food is really yummy. The burger I had today was perfection! My Margharita Verde tasted really yummy and the two desserts were amazing!,Haven't been here in about 10 years I think. Food is still very good!  We had the muscles and the steak. Both were very tasty.  The man who greeted us (I think he was a manager) was not very friendly or welcoming however. Kind of bad first impression. Our server was ok, but very very into himself.  Ugh. But aside from the mediocre service I would go back for the food.,Really awesome evening at Starbelly. Great space, excellent service and a variety of delicious foods.Dumplings were luscious and delicious and cheesy. Pate was soooo good. Even the toast was considered. Gazpacho was creamy and excellent. Cod was flaky and fried chicken was crispy and wonderful.Vaccine requirements started and were super simple and well handled. So good.,Nestled just off Market near the Castro this place has a heated back patio, inside seating and a parklet out front for folks who run warm. Came here with a friend and we both got the Gentleman Caller - a bourbon based drink with vermouth and twist of lemon. We also ordered the star belly salad, Caesar salad and the mission fig pizza. Both salads were yummy but nothing to write home about. The mission fig pizza was divine and it seemed really popular based on the servers comments. Figs, arugula, and some ham - it was so good!Wrapped up our time here with the toffee cake with mascarpone and dates - delicious.,Same tired menu from 2011. Be seasonal or leave the neighborhood. Some nice inventive chef can take over this space from your fast food chain. I hope others follow this review and demand more from our once great neighborhood joint who all but gave up on living.,Friendly service, fun casual atmosphere + California comfort food was so good!Pro Tip: Call ahead to request a seat on their cute back patio, complete with palm trees! It's covered so still warm even on chilly days.We got the chicken & waffles & margherita pizza, 10/10 would recommend!,Love this neighborhood spot! Friendly staff and with well spaced tables. Comfortable bar seating, everything coming out food/ drink looked very fresh! The bar had herbs and fruit that looked like it was cut that day. Bloody Mary hit the spot and the fish tacos were perfect!,Love this spot and the service! The back patio is where it's at! I'm here for both the chicken and waffles or the chicken and French toast. Both fire. Does not disappoint. Also that lavender lemonade is fresh!,Came here on a monday night for dinner and drinks. My party of 3 made reservations for 6:15 and got seated right away. All the staff was very nice in helping us find suitable drinks. All of us ordered drinks, I tried the strawberry alarm clock which was amazing. Fruity and sweet with little taste of alcohol. My friends ordered the salty dog  which was also a fruity drink with grapefruit. We thought the dumplings were pretty good, they came in a light buttery sauce. The mussels were also a hit. Although we thought the bread was a little underdone and chewy. We also thought the fresh spaghetti noodles were chewy and bouncy noting that we wished the sauce was a tad spicier. We loved the pizza! The fresh corn and bacon made for a smoky flavor while the fried egg provided a yummy richness. If you come here try giving the drinks and pizza a try!,Very unassuming from the outside, but it is so cool inside. The decorations fit the vibe of the place. The food is so good. We ordered the spaghetti, butternut squash dumplings and the fries. All of the food was surprisingly good, same goes for the drinks.,WOW. Absolutely delicious and definitely want to come back (it's too dangerous we live 2 blocks away.) We were seated right away at 5pm on a Tuesday and it wasn't too busy even when we left at 6:30. The jalapeño cornbread is the most incredible cornbread I've ever had (also not spicy!) Paired with their homemade honey butter, it's *chefs kiss*The starbelly bacon pizza and sweet corn pizza are ridiculously good. The corn was so rich and the bacon so flavorful. It also wasn't spicy so if you're worried about the jalapeño, it isn't a problem!,So, I'm sitting here seated with my colleagues, and it's been about 20 minutes... no drink have come yet. We haven't ordered cocktails or anything, just soft drinks.  Update: one of the burgers was missing bacon and cheddar, someone ordered a burger, and wasn't offered a side, the fries were not crispy as they could have been and not very salted. I ordered the fried chicken and French toast. It was interesting in the regard that it could have been more flavourful.  The French toast was more eggy than I would like it to be. My supervisor ordered the pizza and said that it wasn't very crispy and that is tasted frozen.,Great food and ambiance. The location is perfect and the staff were helpful.  We had a great experience!,I've heard about this place and so glad I finally had a chance to visit! The front is very unassuming, but as you walk in, it's such an adorable space and the back patio is charming!Tis' the Xmas season, so I loved how they added ornaments to the plants and had beautiful wreaths.I enjoyed the cocktails, Strawberry Alarm Clock and The Salty Dog. Their coffee was great too.The salads are huge portions! The Bibb had slices of bacon on it, I'd recommend cutting them as the bacon weren't cooked to my liking and did not look fresh, but the salad was good. Fish tacos were a nice smallportion if you prefer to eat light, but they did have a kick! (Spicy). The pizzas were great! Good portion for two-three people. Service was great. Well staffed and friendly. I'd love to come back!,Great place with great food! Shared appetizers and espresso martinis. High recommend!!,When we arrived they could not find our reservation.  Great start, folks.We were seated in the patio in the back, which was great, but it was a beautiful afternoon and they had the entire patio covered with a fabric roof, blocking out any chance of enjoying the beautiful weather.  It also defeated any Covid-prevention benefit of sitting outside.I ordered the $18 salad," which was advertised on the menu as containing """"seasonal fruit.""""  It showed up with chopped apples in it.  """"Seasonal fruit"""" at the very end of May would be strawberries or peaches or apricots.  Apples are not """"seasonal"""" in late May", but they certainly are a lot cheaper than strawberries, peaches, or apricots," all of which are available fresh and local at farmer's markets the same week we ate here.  This was blatanant false advertising on the menu.  Just say """"apples"""" if that is the cheap fruit you are going to put in your salad.The dressing was powerfully astringent.  A sweet fruit would have balanced this out a bit.  Tart apples only added to the off-taste of the salad.Service was the kind where they forget about you for long periods of time even though they are not busy. The busser ended up take good care of us", though.,I've been wanting to try this place and I'm glad I did. My appointment was 2 blocks away from this place. I did not regret it. The staff was nice  especially the bartender who helped me. I was seated right away. Monday and I guess this time of the year is busy but at least I did not wait in line. I was alone so I decided to sit at the bar. I order 2 things and a beer for me and it was more than enough. I loved the mussels so much,Great food, service, fun atmosphere - this place has it all! Whether it's lunch, brunch or dinner, it's always super good.,My friends and I went for brunch. We got the chicken po boy with fries, the Italian eggs, and the chilaquiles. I tried a little bit of the three and I thought the best was the Italian eggs. The chilaquiles were good, too, but not something I'd get if I go next time. The chicken po boy was disappointing -- the fried chicken tasted unseasoned and kind of soggy (or wasn't as crispy as it looked like). The vibes were good but the food was OK. As for the service, the staff felt a little all over the place -- which is kind of understandable given it was height brunch time on a weekend.It took a while for us to get someone's attention and felt a little rushed at the end when we wanted to stay longer but was told the table had to be used for a different reservation.,We were looking for a late brunch/ lunch spot and this meal did not disappoint! The cocktail list was great, my favorite was the doctor's orders which was especially good. This chicken and waffles is the best I've got in a long time!  Chicken was cooked perfectly and the waffles were superb. The roasted corn pizza is a seasonal item but wow was it great! Really interesting and complex flavors, the crust was perfect.,My friends and I stopped by for dinner last night to celebrate my friend's promotion at work. We made reservations for 6 people one week in advance.  Smart idea because this place was packed yesterday! I'm talking about indoor and outdoor dining. Yes, they did follow social distancing protocols with the tables. We ordered spaghetti, Po'Boy fried chicken sandwiches, burgers, pizza, and several cocktails. The staff was attentive even though they had a lot of tables to attend to. Meals arrived promptly. Menu quite limited, but the prices are reasonable considering this is SF. We all seemed to enjoy our food. No complaints. It is a little cramped, so I wouldn't recommend it if you have a phobia of small enclosed places. Parking is limited outside since there are so many popular restaurants around the area. You might have to circle around several times to find a spot.,We went here for lunch on SF restaurant week. It was quite lovely. We started with the fries served with three dips. Fries were hot and crispy, but only one of the dips was anything to write home about (one was ketchup). From the prix fixe menu, I had the pate with fig jam and mustard which was very good- especially the fig jam. We both choose the Mediterranean plate as our entree. We liked it very much, but thought it could be spiced a little more heavily. Unfortunately, they brought us our entrees when were just about halfway through our appetizers- making our small tabletop crowded & uncomfortable. We also felt a bit rushed. The star of the show were the drinks and dessert! We both loved the basil cucumber limeade and the coffee was perfect! For dessert, we had the date & toffee cake, which was divine! Such a marvelous combination. The cake was not too sweet and had many layers of flavor while still a bit of a rustic type of dessert. The dates & mascarpone were such a scrumptious compliment! The rich, dark coffee was a satisfying pairing with the dessert. Covid practices were on point. Service very good. Price was reasonable. Super diverse staff & patrons (queer & POC friendly). Accessible. We ate inside and we were very far away from other tables. It felt very safe. Starbelly requires that patrons have their mask on whenever they are not eating/drinking. Outside patio and parklet also looked very inviting so will have to try that next!,Awesome food, filled with bougie staff with a pretentiousness vibe in the air. Let's just talk food:Brussels Sprouts, 4 stars. Great preparation, served crispy.Fish Tacos, 4 1/2 Stars. So delicious and loaded with fresh fish and slaw. Fries on the side were pretty great, too.Bacon Burger, 4 stars. Pretty classic, which is how I like it. The meat quality was quite good as well.Caesar Salad, 5 stars. My favorite dish. I know it's simple, but when it's done right it's so good.Great spot, would definitely give this a go for a brunch.,Came with a large group on a Sunday night. I got reservations here through opentable very easily - there were plenty time and seating options for Sunday night. You're also able to pick whether you want to sit outdoors on their covered patio or inside (standard seating).Our waiter was very friendly and attentive throughout the whole night. We ordered a variety of small plates to share. Favorites were the butternut squash dumplings (the dumpling wrap was so tender and flavorful!) and burrata. We also ordered 3 pizzas to share and they were all great, especially the starbelly bacon - the pie is topped with an overly generous handful of arugula. The crust is a bit crispy for my liking, but others probably would enjoy. Glad I got to try out another restaurant in the area with a very pleasant experience!,Nice atmosphere. Food comes out really quick (granted we were here early). Cocktails are solid and overall pricing is fair. Staff was attentive and engaged. I would go back.,Yummy food and drinks! Best to make a reservation on open table so you don't have to wait. I needed to adjust the time was running late so I called and they accommodated me. Chicken poy boy sandwich was really good! My friend ordered the pizza and loved it. The drinks are really unique and flavorful. There isn't a private parking lot you have to park on the street but there is opened spaces near by for street parking. It is a nice walk around the Castro too. I would come again.,Not only is this an Ocean-Friendly restaurant, meaning this establishment has met/exceeded SurfriderSF's criteria for environmental friendliness, but also this place has a great environment and amazing food! My friend and I were quickly seated on a Monday night, sitting on the outside patio surrounded by adorable plants under a fabric roof. We ate the starbelly salad, potato dumplings," and chorizo pizza. Everything came out in a timely fashion and you could tell all the ingredients were fresh and seasonal. The portions were the perfect size and left you full without being in a food coma. The waiters were also super friendly and checked in on us periodically without being overwhelming. Would highly recommend checking this place out if you're on the fence!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Laundromat,"Wonderful square pizza, plenty of crispy pepperoni. Side order of cheeseburger? I think so!Great food and good beer on tap. 10/10,Best Bagels in SF, bar none.  If I still  lived in SF, id be in at least once per week for local brews on tap, pizza, more....and to get fresh bagels to take home, of course. Counter bagel-ista was efficiently friendly :-),Came here around 1pm and wanted to try their Calabrian chili cream cheese but it was all sold out! Tip: come early! Also, $6 for a huge thing of plain smear and it's light & fluffy?! Yeah, I'll be back.,Cool place to have some drinks and the pizza  was delicious!The service was awesome and the waitress that took our order was nice. The hostess was very welcoming.The Ambiance was cool and not too crowded when I was there.I would recommend this place and give it two thumbs up!!!,On Sunday morning right at opening, there was already a line of about 20 people already waiting out the door. I was hoping to order a toasted bagel with lox, but their morning hours are currently grab and go coffee, bagels and tubs of cream cheese, which I would have picked up if not having planned to eat immediately. I took my coffee and a single sea salt bagel for $3 to go. A fellow customer raves about the chewiness of the bagels from having them at a local farmers market before their brick and mortar opening. I found mine to be very fresh, light and perfectly chewy.The Laundromat also offers dine in pizza, beer and wine later in the day which is a nice bonus for their well decorated interior. I'd like to come back for a late lunch.,FIRE BAGELS AND CALABRIAN CHILI CREAM CHEESE! Best bagels in the bay hands down. They make them fresh in house and at 8:30am they were warm and perfect for a morning breakfast. It's a very simple menu with just bagels and cream cheese; no bagel sandwiches so you have to buy the cream cheese on the side. Omg this is the best cream cheese I've ever had - it's whipped and fluffy and not too strong. I got everything bagels and it was perfectly seasoned and doughy. Service was good - fast and efficient and friendly. I don't remember seeing any seating - it's all to-go in the morning. Will definitely be coming back!,I recently read the SF Gate article where the bagels coming out of The Laundromat were proclaimed to be the best in San Francisco. As someone who lived in New York for many years, I have been on the hunt for a really good NY style bagel. And I can confirm that these ones are absolutely incredible. They're large, doughy, light, and if you get there on the earlier side you'll get to enjoy eating one while it's still fresh out of the oven. This is a real bare bones spot. Come to buy a half or dozen bagels, a tub of scallion cream cheese and find a bench nearby to make yourself a little sandwich. I got some extras to take home to freeze, which I'm super excited about,Ordered take out online on a busy Friday night, was quoted 30 min which seemed oddly short to me. When I arrived to pick up, they hadn't even started my order which it turns out they said online ordering wasn't even supposed to be up yet somehow I found the secret link? ANYway, manager spoke to me about it and was beyond apologetic, I felt bad for them, I wasn't the first case of this and they were already slammed being Friday. So they got working on my order, we waited at hockey haven since the bar was full. 30 min later it was ready and we were on our way. DESPITE THIS, pizza is still worth the wait. Some of the best square pizza in the city (note: not Detroit style but pretty similar). We had one of everything: cheese, pepperoni, mushroom, and broccoli rabe, plus tried both salads. Everything we had was super solid. Dough is springy and didn't taste dense (although you do feel it later as two slices is def enough for an adult). The cornicione was crispy from the cheese and surprisingly not too greasy. Clearly using great ingredients. I actually really loved the kale salad! (Caesar was good too). Highly recommend!,The everything bagel is everything you'd want as a bagel, but we learned that you have spread your cream cheese on the bagel yourself. So if you plan to get it to go, remember to ask for a knife before you leave.,Easily one of the best bagels in SF! Excited to go back and try the pizza. The fun atmosphere definitely added to the experience!,This and boichik are probably the two best bagels in the Bay Area. Malty, nice chew, good size. I know they're just getting started so maybe this will change, but it'd be nice if you could get bagels sliced with cream cheese there rather than getting whole bagels and a tub of cheese. This would mean you could sort of hang around outside and eat instead of having to take it home first (or I guess you could bring a cutting board?). Anyways, it's a very good bagel. As I noted in my Boichik review, I think this bagel compares favorably with the best of NYC. The difference there is your average bagel is still pretty good, while in the Bay you have to go to a much shorter list of places.,Definitely the best bagel I've ever had in SF. I was lucky to try these bagels when they were Holey Roller in Santa Cruz and they blew my mind -- I feel even luckier that they are now available in SF at The Laundromat! This space is sweet inside and I'm excited to have learned that they are now offering a vegan cheese option on their pizza. I'm looking forward to trying the pizza soon and in the meantime will be a bagel regular here!,Holy bagel pizza and burgers. Wednesday night delight potato salad on the side. Pizza has yet to be eaten but I am just biding my time. The bagels are the only ones worth eating in SF and they got dope mercy an amazing atmosphere and an insanely lovely staff,I feel like I have to specify that I am a former New Yorker whenever I review Pizza or Bagels.Let me just say, I was excited for this place, and that I plan on coming back for the pizza at night (and hey owners if you are reading this - what about pizza bagels as a menu item?????).  I went the Sunday after they got a write up in some food blog for SF, so there was a line, and let me just say that they keep that line moving and they kept people in line informed about timing (and if there would be bagels ready when you got to the front of the line). Inside everyone from the Bagel puller to the cashier and the runner were all working so hard with big smiles on their faces.As I got up to the rack where the bagel puller was, he started to pull my first bagel - when the lady come out with Fresh/HOT-hot outta the oven poppy seed ones, so I had my guy put one back and pull the hot ones for me, he was happy to do so. The bagels are $3/per and a HUGE thing of calbrian chili cream cheese was $7 - which I thought was a pretty good deal. I wasn't originally gonna buy cream cheese, because I figured I would take them home. But baby when hot bagel calls - you must attend and adjust to the situation at hand.  I copped a seat outside on the bench and dug in. These bagels were so hot they were (almost) to hot to eat, but I managed.  The not amazing news is that they are not quite authentic NY bagels, they are too fluffy on the inside and not quite chewy enough.  The flavor was good though, and I am happy for any bagel place to succeed in SF's ""bagel desert"".  I am going to make one of the leftover bagels into a pizza bagel, and I am looking forward to the outcome very much. MAZEL Laundromat!,A New York bagel in SF! I am over the moon. Delicious egg everything bagel, fantastic scallion cream cheese. Dough is chewy but still light. Cinnamon raisin bagel was perfectly balanced between sweet and salty. I would love a sweet cream cheese to pair with it in the future, like a strawberry. Super nice service. We will be back, probably tomorrow :) Thank you, Laundromat team!!,I'm a huge fan of bagels.  So when I read the about it on Eater SF, I was curious.  Located in the Outer Richmond, it's down the block from the Balboa Theater.  Yesterday I happened to be in Laurel Village for an appointment.  From there it'll be a short drive over. I found an easy space on Balboa St.  around 10:30am. I walked in and saw bins full of bagels near the front entrance.  A customer ahead of me purchased two bag full $53 worth. My turn next.  I asked if they offer toasted bagels.  No.  Although they offer tubs of schmear.   Out of cinnamon raisin bagels.  I bought two ""everything"" bagels for hubby & myself.  $3 each.  We didn't go straight home.  Went to a coffee shop to meet a friend.  Took our bagels out.  Went great with coffee. One of the best bagels ever!!!  Soft and chewy.  Plenty of garlic, sesame, poppy.  So fresh. Huge bagel.  I enjoyed every bite. I can't wait to go back.  And toast it at home.  And buy a tub of schmear.,WOW! This spot is amazing! Some of the best pizza I've had in San Francisco. The crust is crunchy and cheesy. The little gem Caesar also delicious and flavorful. Their bagels are also amazing! So grateful to have this gem in the neighborhood. Highly recommend checking them out, it's a great vibe!,100% perfect bagel with a nice, toothsome exterior and perfectly chewy interior. These are your classic malty NYC bagels, the best I've had since H&H shut down. There are a few basic kinds of bagels, nothing too crazy. The handful of schmears they offer are also tasty, though I like my bagels on their own.Note:Irregular hours since it's actually a morning pop up by Holey Roller Bagels at The Laundromat. They start at 8am on certain weekdays.,It's good.  They only sell to go and in very limited supply.  I also noticed they sell frozen bagels. So get there early .. like before 9 to ensure you get some.  The schmear is decent.. that's also to go and in 1/2 pints.  They manage to get a favorable write up .. and so the lines are long. I was curious to try them since I was just in NY and very good bagels are abundant.  Seems like there's a NY bagel trend going on in SF.. lol.,This place is excellent.  I don't know enough about bagels to the extent that I can explain why it's greater than Costco bagels but they are.  Yum yum in my tum.  Great texture, great flavor.  I eat it with butter.,Like a phoenix from the ashes, a dingy laundromat has been transformed into a culinary gem. We've ordered the winter vegetable pizza 4-5 times in the last two months: a masterful composition of flavor and texture (the crunch ratio on the crust is spot on). The side order of roasted brussel sprouts with balsamic vinegar and goat cheese (not listed on the menu?) is also truly extraordinary. And their morning bagels are the best we've encountered in the Bay Area. Period. Word travels fast people...it was a long wait for a table on this Friday night!,So excited to have this new addition to the neighborhood! Support local small businesses! Soft opening right now and officially opening in November 10th. You know it will be good because the owners operate a bunch of local theaters like the Balboa Theater and Holey Roller Bagels.,This place has been very busy! Coffee and Bagels in the morning and Pizza and Burgers at night. This place has beer and mocktails. The pizza is Detroit-style with about 4 options. Each pizza had 8 slices.Go early around 5 PM tables fill up quickly.,Very soft opening.  Just hugh bagels.  Today they only have ""everything"" bagel.  I can taste the garlic. Very soft and thick inside.  Kind of a little crusty on the bottom.  Welcome to the neighborhood.  Really opens November 10th.  Catch them 8 am to 2 pm to be safe till Nov 10th.,Neighborhood burger night! Delicious smash burgers with potato salad. Little on the messy side but reminiscent of shake shack with the potato buns.,Oh wow. This place is a bit of a trek, 20 mins drive from my apartment, but you bet your buns I'll be back. We came late so they only had plain left, but this is the best bagel I've had in SF by a very long mile.  Chewy, perfect density, with a great crust. Staff were friendly and inviting. Just go knowing they don't cut or toast on site. We ate ours by peeling apart and dipping in the schmear and still absolutely loved them. 10/10!,We love the Laundromat and are so grateful they turned a closed laundromat into a hipster food and drink haven. The breakfast and dinner menus are simple and perfection. They are kind, welcoming, and family friendly. The ambiance is cozy and artistic. Food standouts for me are the pumpernickel bagel and the cheese pizza. Both are simple items but prepared expertly so they are complex tasting. The natural wine is delicious for my taste preference that is more tart. The kale salad is so good, the dressing and pepitas compliment the hearty greens.Bravo!,Great bagels! This place caught my eye after a visit to Butter Love. No wait on a weekday morning around 10am. Staff was friendly and there was a good selection of bagels and cream cheese. I've lived in SF for almost 20 years and have been disappointed by Bay Area bagels so so many times. And I say that as someone who grew up in Phoenix! I was hesitant to stop in, but so glad I did. I picked up a dozen bagels ($30 for a bakers dozen) and two tubs of cream cheese ($6 each). At home I toasted up a salt bagel and slathered it with Calabrian chili cream cheese and was in heaven. The bagel had great flavor, perfect density (not too bready or too light), and good chewiness. The cream cheese was excellent. My whole family enjoyed these and I will be back.,Best bagels in San Francisco.Every other bagel in SF is bagel suboxone taken in the rain outside of a sad trailer.The Laundromat's bagels are the first time you shot up in your cousin's basement.This is probably an unwelcome metaphor, but I know where I'm going to score bagels from now on.,Absolutely loved this place. Went in the morning for bagels and in the afternoon to try their pizza. The bagels are exactly as everyone describes. Soft and chewy on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Service was awesome. People were so friendly. They had several different options to choose from. They had sesame, poppy, cinnamon raisin, plain, plain with salt, and I forget the last one. Cream cheese was $7 but it's enough for you to use throughout the week. I had the Calabrian chili oil with cream cheese. I wouldn't call it amazing, but I still enjoyed it. Had a spicy kick to it, but nothing too overwhelming. **now for the pizza**Oh my god, the dough on the pizza is similar to the texture on the bagel. Soft and chewy on the inside with a bit of crispy texture on the outside. The cheese was chewy and delicious, and they were generous with the amount of pepperoni on top. It definitely feeds about 2-3 people. This place is family friendly!! They have high tops for the kids, and they were kind enough to give our little one crayons and paper to keep her entertained. Service was swift and amazing. Everyone was super kind and welcoming. Would 100% come back again for bagels and pizza.,We were so excited to check out this new neighborhood restaurant and came here on a Wednesday night.Ordered the kale salad, pepperoni pizza, cheese pizza, and mushroom pizza. The Kale salad was good, but wished the dressing was massaged more into the salad. The pizzas claimed to feed 2-3 people and when they came out, we thought we needed to order more. However, the pizzas were quite filling so I can definitely see how it could fill 3 people. Really loved the crust of the pizza, but wished they spread out the sauce on the pizza instead of putting dollops of sauce so I could get a bite of cheese and sauce together.Overall, great meal but I'd wait to come back again since this place is still relatively new.,Bagels 4.5 stars - great chew from boiling, would be 5 stars if they baked a smidge more for a better crunchy exterior. Cream cheese is high quality but the salmon spread needs more salmon if they're going to charge $13 for it.  All in all, a new neighborhood gem - with a few tweaks, it'd be 5 stars.,Super excited to have this place in town. Staff were super friendly and also excited to be there - their energy is contagious I guess! Loved the beautiful bar counter and aesthetic and vibe. Pizza had that good crispy crust (square slices kind of pizza). One was good for two people. It was a bit on the pricier side but not unheard of for SF pricing, so glad to support local businesses if that's what it takes to get a new place to take root! Pretty good wine and beer list, hoping they expand their cocktail menu when they settled in. Overall, nailed it on opening night and looking forward to going back!,If you like bagels, you know it's hard to find a good one in the city. This may be the best bagel in San Francisco. Crisp - not crunchy - on the outside, moist and doughy interior. They also have a nice selection of cream cheeses (including calabrian chili which is GREAT). Highly recommend!,Very cool place and delicious pizza Definitely worth stopping Here. The service was also very friendly.,Amazing bagels!  Just the right mix of chew  and crisp.  Beautiful interior with real wood bar and funky art.  Bagels in the morning and pizza at night!  Yum,My wife and I have been waiting for this place to open and we were not disappointed!  The menu is super simple, and everything is awesome. Really great pizza, salads, and a wide variety of wine and beer. We had a kale salad and the broccolini pizza, and there were no leftovers! The service is excellent as well. Highly recommend,We came for dinner and man, I am so happy this place joined the neighborhood. Here's what I love about it: 1) The space:  a nice, long, respectable bar to eat a slice of pizza at. A third of the casework behind it is devoted to a record collection where they actually play the records! I feel personal touches everywhere: posters from the city's past, cloth napkins, funky art. It's warm, informal, and comfortable.  2) Staff/Service: Great!!! I'm not a service snob and certainly don't expect much when out for pizza,  but I really liked the folks working here: from the hostess to the barback, everyone here was accommodating, friendly and on point. 3) Food: We ordered both salads on the menu and they were very, very good. A crisp, good salad this side of Balboa is nonexistent, and I would return for these alone. The pizzas...we ordered a Pepperoni and a Mushroom. The toppings were quality and yummy, but I found the the crust too thick, too bready, too chewy and not balanced; that's probably more of a personal preference than a flaw. I'm a loyal fan. I've always wanted a place like this on Balboa, and I'm coming back.,this is one of the best run food locations that I know of currently in town, they have flawless execution with their items. I enjoy coming here since it's reliable and efficient love it guys,Excellent food and ambianceOnly critique is that the music was waaaay too loud. Servers couldn't hear what we were ordering and we could barely hear each other speak,I am so thankful that I live in the Richmond because these are the best bagels I have had in my life. I personally prefer these bagels to Boichik's since they are more light and fluffy. Definitely check this place out! (Side note: it might be a little hard to find on google maps since there are too many laundromats in SF),This places blows every other bagel place in the city out of the water. They're not cheap, but nothing exorbitant either. Everyone there is really friendly and on weekday mornings there isn't a line.If only they had breakfast sandwiches.,Best bagels in the towns, this time only get bagels, next time going to get cream, and will trying the pizza dinner time,Really cool interiors. Kind peopleA pizza order took more than 40 minutes after ordering.,I am yet another person from the old country (NY/NJ and it seems like all these reviews are all by transplants) and have had a few bagels in my day.  These bagels are pretty damn close to what you get at good spots in NYC and many other less trafficked towns in the Northeast.  They are very good.The bagel is big like a NYC one but it also has the heft and chew of the best ones of my youth.  Tried the salt and plain and both were very good.The Calabrian chili cream cheese - well if that sounds good to you, get it because its a revelation!Finally, the local family that runs this business are wonderful people.  That alone wont sell food but they make very good bagels & shmear so shopping here is a no brainer.  Next up...pizza...,So fortunate to have this new restaurant and bar in the outer balboa strip!!! Fresh made bagels best I've had in SF! Soft chewy inside and crisp outer shell, only sell shmear at this point. Just had the mushroom pizza and the Pepperoni, thicker soft dough and excellent flavor and texture.Owners also operate the balboa and 4 Star theaters, invested in the outer Richmond and lovely people! I'll make this my regular neighborhood restaurant stop not only for the quality food but the incredible inviting atmosphere and people!,I've tried both the bagels and pizza here. Bagels were excellent. I love the chewiness. We got the plain cream cheese which was very soft and fluffy to go with the bagels. We also tried the salmon spread which was just okay. I wish they made breakfast sandwiches with the bagels, or even let people sit and eat for breakfast but they don't. It's basically grab and go in the morning. They also serve pizza at night. After seeing the movie ""inside out"" with the main character Riley commenting about SF's broccoli pizzas, I thought how bad can it be.....well, I would have to agree with her. I think I'll go with a traditional pepperoni or cheese next time. The crust and cheese were pretty good, but that broccoli on it.....sigh.,Great bagels!   Good selection of flavors of both bagels and cream cheese.   Friendly staff.  Good value,,Excellent bagels (take them home to toast yourselves), can't wait to try the pizza and 4-Star offerings soon, too. Highly recommend!,Best bagel in SF lol - testified and satisfied! Wish they would launch more varieties.,Best, and most unique pizza I have had in recent memory. I am speechless. Great beers, 10/10 would highly recommend,The bagels are excellent.  Now my favorite bagels in SF.  Enjoyed talking with the owners. I look forward to trying the pizza next time.  I hope this place is successful.,The Laundromat slings some seriously delicious Sicilian-style pizza - it was probably one of the best pizzas I've had in my life! A beautiful thick focaccia-like crust that just melts in your mouth. The beer & wine selection was on point and our kale salad did not disappoint. Don't miss out on the bagels & cream cheese served in the mornings.,Fantastic new addition to the Outer Richmond! The bagels are great and the cream cheese spreads rule! Yes, you should support this awesome local business, but go there regardless because the bagels are so excellent.,the bagels were really good I didnt think anything of the store before walking in but after getting a bagel definitely will be coming back",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Marufuku Ramen,"The noodle was very good I got the Tonkatsu Ramen Noodles and the staff was very respectful and nice and overall I recommended this place I would definitely come back here again,My favorite ramen place in town! I always get the ramen with chicken where they give you a whole cooked peace of chicken on the side. It comes on a frying pen and is amazing. Can not go wrong with this place in my opinion.,I 100% will go there again.The ramen was so good and the best part of the food came out in seconds.,Hands down the best ramen spot in all of Japantown mall. Trust me, I've tried all of them before. This was my third time here. Their menu has changed but in a good way. It's more minimalist which lets me know they are specialized and focus of making these limited dishes more elevated. The food: Chicken Karage was 4.5/5Wish the outer skin was a bit crunchy and crisper. The insides were freshly packed with juicy flavor and soft moist texture with a tender flavor. Not over powering. Both ramen were (5/5) exceptionally crafted with chewy/QQ perfectly cooked noodles. The broth was rich, complex and thick. Each of the toppings are exceptionally in their own but remarkable when assembled in each bowl of noodle. For two grown adult male of 6 ft and above, the normal size ramen with medium to spicy ( Not ""very Spicy) should be the standard choice. They use the same size bowl for the upgraded size but it became too cluttered and excess effort for a dining experience. The normal size is already filling for us. Recommend getting there below 630 pm before the crowd which was mostly young ppl.,Marufuku Ramen is amazing!! I usually order for delivery (surprisingly travels very well!), and the ingredients are fresh and full of flavor. I ate at the restaurant for the first time recently and had a great experience! There is a bit of a wait because it is so popular, but you can shop around Japantown as you wait your turn. I ordered the Hakata Tonkotsu, one of the best ramen I have ever had. Highly recommend it! Tip: you can ask for some spice on the side if you like your ramen to have a little kick,My bf wanted to visit Japantown for his birthday today so after a quick search I decided we'd either be going to Marufuku or another ramen spot in the area. We got to the mall early enough that it was a 20-40 minute wait for a table so we put our names in and strolled around until our table was ready. The service is excellent. Our server was super pleasant and the staff was by frequently to take care of refills and clear finished plates off the table. It was our first time here and we decided on the gyoza and marufuku bites to start, and I had the spicy tantan men ramen while he had the hakata tonkotsu ramen (spicy). I had my eye on their seasonal pork bun but they were out, but the bites that were suggested to us instead are delicious. I probably could have eaten 2-3 of those as a meal and been perfectly content. The food all came out quickly and I enjoyed my ramen. I didn't find it to be particularly spicy, but it tasted good. I had a taste of my bf's broth and his had a little more quick but also wasn't very spicy. Overall we both enjoyed our meals and I would definitely return.,Always a long wait for Marufuku Ramen.  Located in the JapanTown Center you can window shop while you wait.  Our wait on a Saturday was 90 minutes, about what we expected.  Despite being super busy, all the servers are super nice.We started with the Marufuku Bites, which are basically pork belly buns.  Super good.  Also had the karaage chicken and a special BBQ chicken.  Both were fantastic.Of course, you come here for the ramen, the Hakata Ramen to be specific.  It was great.  Noodles soft, broth flavorful.  Egg and chashu are perfectly cooked.  Yum!They also have a drink called Kimono Mikan which was fantastic.  Great flavor and not too sweet.Overall, a great dining experience despite the long wait.  Prices are reasonable, the service is excellent and the food is fantastic.  Guess that's why there's such a long wait to get in.,Still one of my fav ramen spots in the city! Got the tonkatsu ramen and the noodles were super thin and chewy, soaking up the fragrant, soothing broth. Loved the jammy egg and plethora of green onion as well. Jammy egg was delicious!,A very popular ramen place in Japan Town SF. The food and service were on point. We ordered the spicy tan tan men, which was delicious and enough for the two of us to share. The portion size for ramen is quite large and it's very filling. Also got the shishito peppers and chicken karaage as apps. Both were okay but nothing exceptional about them. I felt the shishito peppers weren't even salted well like I have had at other places so was a little disappointed about that. When we reached there was about 30min wait on a weekday dinner. But it is conveniently located in a shopping area so there's a ton to do while you wait. The place has tight seating but it's comfortable enough. We will visit again to try the other ramen choices.,FOOD: even though i got it to go, i was able to assemble it at home. flavor of the broth is great, spice is amazing too! i didn't expect the vegan one to be so flavorful but it was. the noodles could definitely be thicker & chewier, but everyone has their own preference.SERVICE: i was upset because they put four bowls of ramen in one togo bag and of course, one of the broth bowls cracked and leaked all over the bag. they definitely should have separated it or at the very least double bagged it. expect long waits on weekends, up to 2 hrs wait.,It was my first time here and omg this is a delicious ramen spot. If you have more than an hour to spare to wait for this, I definitely recommend. We put our name on the waitlist and it was about a 75 minute wait, so in that time you can wander around all the cute Japantown shops. Upon getting seated, the service was so friendly and efficient. We ordered the Hakata Tonkotsu DX. The broth was very rich and wasn't too salty. They were also generous with all the toppings that come in the ramen. The egg was notably good with the jammy yolk and the noodles were perfectly chewy.This is definitely a contender for some of the best ramen in SF. If you don't mind the long wait, this is worth it to check out!,Took an Uber to San Francisco on our way to visit a pop up bar for the holidays called Tinseltown. After our visit close to dinner time, we headed towards Japantown to try out a new ramen place. I made the stop here seeing how good the reviews are. It's best to arrive early so, you can put your name on the waitlist as the line gets pretty long. It was all worth the wait and a fun time strolling around the Japantown mall, cute little shops! Finally I received a text message about an available table ready for us and were seated around an hour after of waiting. Once seated the service was fast and on point with an amazing vegetable ramen to dive into on their menu. My request was accommodated to remove the bell peppers and onions, I am not a big fan of peppers so this was great! The ramen was served hot with the flavors well balanced and the bowl was fulfilling. The tofu chashu was a new experience for me and the texture was quite nice. On the other hand, my friend ordered the chicken paitan. They loved their chicken, the broth, and ended up going through the bowl with no noodle left at the bottom. Cannot wait to visit again!,Your search for the BEST RAMEN of the Bay Area ends here. We have tried dozens of ramen places and at the first sip of the broth nodded at one another with, yes, this is it!Wait time: 55 minutes, which seems typical at lunch time on a weekend. We were number 41 on the waitlist. You check in on a kiosk and get notified when it's your turn.Once seated, service is super prompt! They were out with our ramen and drinks within minutes. I found the portion to be very filling, but if you would like, you can order additional hot ramen noodles before finishing your broth.Note: This place is located inside a Japanese indoor mall. I appreciated not having to wait out in the cold and getting to browse through the art booths and bookstores in the mall while waiting.,The ramen was dank! I got spicy which ended up being way spicier than I anticipated but it was still delicious. The nose was runny and the sweat drippin. My friends got extra noodles for their ramen for only $2 extra! The gyoza was good but tiny. The service was quick and great. The wait was very long. I would recommend coming 30 minutes or so before you expect to sit and eat. It was very busy and loud inside but we didn't mind the noise,We enjoyed the Marufuku Ramen in Irvine so much that we went to the original location in SF on a recent trip. Unfortunately the Yelp waitlist was already closed, so we signed up on the waitlist when we got to the restaurant. Although the waitlist showed several parties in front of us with a wait time of 30-45 minutes, we were pleasantly surprised to get a text within 15 minutes, notifying us that our table was ready. Luckily we had not gone far and made it back in a couple of minutes.The woman who seated us and took our order was cheerful and maintained that friendly spirit during the time we were there, greeting all the customers. The dining area is kind of cramped, but our bowls came out quickly. I got the Chicken Paitan, medium spice level, and it was just as good as my previous experience. On a cold day, the rich chicken broth warmed my soul. My husband got the Vegetable Ramen and that looked especially enticing as well.Marufuku Ramen is located inside a mall, which also has a parking lot (unfortunately no validation). You can check out Kinokuniya, the Japanese bookstore, with books in both Japanese and English, a huge selection of manga and various other sundries while you wait.,Veg/vegan reviewer: loved the vegetable ramen, it was delicious. Worth coming back to this place :)Our friend ordered a meat Ramen and she loved it as well. The ambience is pretty good as well.Tip: they take reservations at the door, so the wait time isn't bad at all. You can walk around Japantown until you get your call.,I came to Marufuku based on recommendations from several locals while visiting San Francisco. Ramen is one of my top favorite cuisines and this place definitely did not disappoint! I came here on a cold rainy night so the warm sake and delicious ramen were the perfect pairing. After arriving, I immediately got on the guest list and had to wait about 35 minutes. The place is small and extremely popular but it's in a really fun shopping mall so I would recommend coming in and immediately getting on the list, and then walk around to the various shops.For appetizers we got the chicken karaage and the house hot sake. The sake was delicious and definitely recommend! The chicken was good, but as others have said the meat was slightly too much meat. I'd recommend they use less meat here and more of that delicious sauce. The ramen is the real star of the show! My partner and I both got the Hakkata Tonkotsu Dx. Definitely a contender in the best ramen I've ever had. I ordered mine spicy and it was honestly perfect. Will definitely be back here! Also, it's worth noting the waiters here were all extremely sweet and crazy efficient. I can't wait to visit this gem again!,I didn't check beforehand, but you can put your name down on the yelp waitlist prior to arriving. Cuts down wait time. We went on a Sunday so the wait was like an hour. We killed time with all the vendors they had in the building. I got the hakata tonkatsu in medium spicy (had a flight to catch so I didn't want to be too bold on a 5 hr flight home). The medium spice level was perfect, not too spicy and not too mild. Very subtle, lingering spice that leaves a nice feeling in your mouth. The tonkatsu broth was phenomenal. I tend to not get tonkatsu ramen because they tend to feel heavier than a miso. This broth was light and packed so much flavor. The chasu was a little tough, but not too dry. The egg was a good soft boiled and wasn't overcooked. I liked the thinner noodles they had. It had a good bite to it, despite being thin. The bowl is very unique and small, however, I felt like I kept eating and eating and I had so much left hahaWe also go the chicken paitan DX because honestly the side chicken looked so good in pictures. My fiancé is also a sucker for when things say like ""only 15 servings a day!"" The broth for this ramen was a little different from the tonkatsu. I couldn't tell if I liked it or not. There was a bunch of corn that sunk to the bottom of the bowl. The chicken we got on the side was seasoned like a roasted duck. A lot of the char-sui influenced/inspired. The chicken was good, but man that was a lot for the bowl of ramen and a 1/4 of chicken. In terms of broth and overall flavors, this is one of our new favorite ramen places that beats our regular Chicago favorites. Glad we stopped by and waited.,Top tier ramen spot in the bay. Great place to try for tourists, I bring friends who visit here and they always love it. It's located on the second floor in the corner near the stairs. What I love about this Marufuku and the one in Oakland is they do a live wait on Yelp. It's super convenient because they always have a wait, always. There's a reason tho, it's worth it. It's not a place to stay and hang, it's best to eat and leave. This location especially is smaller than the one in Oakland. The food is always served very quickly and the service is kind and helpful.,I went to the Marufuku in Japantown, SF this weekend. We put our names  on the waitlist for forty minutes before getting seated, but had fun exploring the different restaurants and shops in the Kabuki Mall and surrounding area. The service was prompt and very warm towards us despite the weekend rush. The Hakata Tonkotsu deluxe and Chicken Paitan dishes were both awesome! So much flavor in both, and I ordered some extra noodles on the side to bring my remaining broth home (very good portions)! This is a great spot if you are looking for comfort food/ramen. I will be coming back to explore the mall in greater detail soon:),Visiting family in the Bay Area, we decided to make a trip to Japantown to eat and shop! When in Japantown you just need to eat ramen. Put your name on their list immediately because you can expect to wait. They'll text you when your table is ready so you can browse Maido or Kinokuniya bookstore while you wait. Hakata Tonkatsu - Hakata style ramen with rich pork broth. Chashu pork (simmered pork belly), seasoned soft boiled egg, green onions, kikurage mushrooms, and bean sprouts-- oh holy mother of God, the broth was something else. I thought I knew what good ramen tasted like-- apparently I didn't-- I just wanted to keep sipping the broth with a spoon. Spicy Ramen with Creamy Chicken Patina broth Topped with Chili-flavored Ground Chicken. Tantan chicken(Spicy ground chicken , seasoned soft boiled egg, green onions, bean sprouts, assorted green and top with sesame seeds: this was my meal and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I prefer the thicker ramen noodles and that's why I picked this one. It did not disappoint. The noodles were springy and perfectly al dente -- the broth had a rich umami, spicy but not. nose dripping spicy. The soft-boiled egg was perfect. I'm not a huge fan of ground chicken, but this was perfect and did not detract from my gastronomic pleasure. We had the gyoza, kakuni bowl and the karaage bowls as well, all very tasty. But I mean-- when you go to a ramen house-- that's what the star is! Ramen! And this place knows it's ramen! I CAN.NOT wait to go back again. Because I want to get the Hakata Tonkatsu with a high spice level!,Marufuku is a treasure in the Japan Town Mall. It's located in the Kinokuniya building, second floor. Adorable ambiance. We waited about 20 mins to be seated, which I was told was thankfully quick as it's been known that the wait can be brutal at times. Grateful that the waitress took some time to give us recs- they were great recs!My friend and I both ordered the hakata tonkatsu dx- his medium spicy and mine not spicy. Broth was rich and light. Pork belly was tender. The bowl is deceiving. It's deep and noodles are packed in. We were full and satisfied.Our waitress suggested the marufuku bites. Essentially they are cha-siu boas. Really tasty and a perfect intro/first dish to your meal.,Came here on a Wednesday afternoon around 2pm and they were already packed. We got lucky and got seated at their last available table. It is really small compact inside.Their popular ramen is the Hakata Tonkotsu which is what I ordered and my bf ordered the Chicken Paitan Dx which came with chicken on a sizzling plate. We also ordered the 2 premium chashu buns for $14, expensive but worth it! I highly recommend the premium buns, the chashu was super soft and I loved the onions, mayo and sauce on it. Chicken broth was creamy and I loved the grilled chicken that it came with on the sizzling plate. It was tender and super flavorful. Honestly, I liked the buns and the grilled chicken better than the ramen. I didn't really like the noodles and we both thought the ramens were okay.,Came late on a Friday near closing l, waitlisted in person, and still waited 20 minutes. Ordered the Hakata tonkotsu dx and it came out just as good as I remember. Broth was smooth and not too oily, easy to drink. The noodles come thin yet perfectly cooked, firm yet chewy. The braised pork and sliced chashu were both delicious and soft boiled egg stayed runny. Overall, an excellent bowl of ramen.,This is easily the BEST ramen spot I've been to. Everything was so good, from the service to the ambiance to the food -- wow. We stopped in during our vacation in SF during the middle of the day for lunch and it was busy. However the wait only took about 10-15 minutes, but it was definitely one of the busiest restaurants we visited during our trip there.The service was great, people were checking on us frequently, but not too much to where it's overwhelming. The restaurant isn't too loud, but not quiet.Now the food -- it was all so good. We started with the chicken karaage and pork bao buns and both were amazing. The dipping sauce they have with the chicken is a great touch to the crispy chicken. And the bao buns had great flavor. My sister and I split the tonkotsu ramen (to avoid getting too full in the middle of the day -- although, I wish I had my own bowl after trying it). It was delicious! The broth was amazing -- not too fatty, but still creamy and flavorful. I think it's the best ramen broth I've ever had, it was delicious.If you're looking for ramen in the SF area, I highly, highly recommend checking out Marufuku!,Since moving to Sacramento there's no ramen that comes close to Marufuku. They're not worth my money up north. EVERYTIME I come back to SF I have to make sure I order $100 worth of take out ramen to have for 2 days for me and my kids because it's our family favorite! Even if it's take out it tastes just as fresh as eating inside the restaurant! Too bad I can't have any fried squid to go with it!Thank you Marufuku you always have a place in our hearts and bellies!,Got a table for one and was on the waitlist for a really long time. It took about an hour and a half to get a text to see the hostess. The only tiny thing that bugged me a bit is that they kept trying to rush me out since I was a table for one and every time I took a break from eating to get a breather or to just peek at my phone, they kept asking if I was done and needed a to-go box. Aside from that, the food is really good and worth the wait and everyone that works there is super attentive and checks in on you and your cup is never empty!! The Hakata Tonkotsu was so flavorful and really hits the spot on a cold day.,Marafuku is one of the classic ramen spots in the Bay. If you ask people what the most popular ramen spots are here, this is definitely on the list along with Ramen Nagi probably.I decided to try the chicken ramen because I always default to a tonkotsu. The chicken ramen broth was extremely rich and almost tasted like a tonkotsu broth, which was a great surprise because I was honestly expecting a clear broth like American chicken noodle soup LOL.Wait times are pretty long but service is super quick here -- I think we got our food like five minutes after ordering. It's also a small restaurant so expect to be elbow to elbow with another guest.,Came back here recently. This tasted better than the last time! The meat was really soft and smokey. This style isn't my favorite ramen style but the quality is undeniable! I order extra noodles and you still got to get the garlic on the side.,I haven't had marufuku in years but I am so glad I got to try it again. We got here on a Thursday night around 8pm. There was a wait but not super long. We got seated at around 8:15pm. We ordered the Hakata Tonkotsu Dx ramen. It came with 2 slices of chashu pork, braised thick pork belly, and other regular toppings like seasoned soft boiled egg, bean sprouts, corn, seaweed, etc. I think the highlight was definitely the braised thick pork belly. It legit melted in our mouth when we took a bite. I also love their broth - so milky and rich in umami flavor - it pairs super well with their noodles. A bowl of Marufuku ramen was perfect for a rainy day in SF. By the way, if you are a small eater and would prefer sharing instead of getting a bowl, I would recommend getting the deluxe ramen and then add a bowl of noodles for $1.75! Overall, it's definitely worth the wait and my favorite ramen spot in Japantown!,I usually go to the Oakland location but I also like to stop by here while I'm in Japantown. I know the drill, if I'm here around 10am then I'll stop by at 11 and get seated right away. If I'm here after 12pm on a weekend or something and there's an artist fair going on I'll put my name down and shop around since there can be a 80 minute wait.I love the staff here. I usually take my little brother with me and I love how they always address him and let him make his own choices instead of expecting me to order for him. I always get the tonkatsu dx, I love kakuni and can't always find them at other ramen places. The gyoza was tiny but was delicious.,Our first time here and the wait wasnt as long for a Saturday late afternoon (4:30-5pm). It was very easy to get on the waitlist through Yelp (they have a kiosk and you can do it on your phone) which is very convenient. The staff are very friendly and its a very quick service! The staff that took our order was really helpful trying to find me a ramen order that didnt have any of my allergens (seafood or eggs). I went ahead and ordered the vegetable ramen with a side of the chashu to go with it. Im not a ramen fan, however, this bowl was sooooo good. I crave it now and will come again!The bowls looked small but it was very filling that we had some to take as leftovers. Give this place a try if you're exploring Japantown and get hungry!,Located inside the Japantown Plaza. Came here on Veterans Day and there was already a line at the door 10 minutes before opening. We were luck enough to sit in the last spots provided.Order: -Premium chasu ramen (seasonal): The broth was luscious, creamy, and wonderful. It is on the rich side and seasoned very well. The chasu had a great balance between fat and lean. Perfect sized portions and you'll eat every last bit of the soup. The noodles had good texture, still had a good bounce and thin. I enjoyed my experience overall. It's definitely busy and a popular restaurant. If you're willing to wait, more power to you! It might be worth it to get there before opening and wait in line then than during the peak times.,I stopped by on a Monday evening and had about a 30 min wait - the Yelp waitlist is nice so that you can walk around the shopping center while waiting. I order the hakata tonkatsu and was immediately blown away by the broth. It was so flavorful and delicious! Another highlight was the pork - so good, melt in your mouth meat with great flavor. The only downside for me was the thinner noodle, I prefer one a bit thicker. Other than that, it was a great food experience with fast service.,Excellent Hakata-style Tonkotsu ramen.  This was my first time here but I will be back.  The noodles were the thin kind in a rich tonkotsu broth.  The soft boiled seasoned egg was the standout item for me.  It was perfectly cooked - soft and gooey inside and they gave you a whole egg vs the usual half. The char siu was thinly cut which I like as it makes it easier to eat.  For folks who like spicy, you can tailor the spice level of your broth.   The place is small but the service is fast.  They have regular booth/chair seating however we got seated in the middle of the room where it was step down seating which made it a little challenging to get in/out.  (good thing I was wearing pants)Overall solid ramen place with great service.,Waited for over an hour and it was worth it.  One of the best ramen places in the area.  I like that they have an electronic check in that sends you a text when a table is ready. Excellent quality food and very efficient service.  Once you get in they are fast.  They clean up as they go so it's very hygienic.  Chicken kaarage was very good I highly recommend it!,Absolutely love this place! It is the best ramen in the Bay Area and worth the wait. I have been to the one in Oakland before and it was delicious. This was my first time at the SF-Japan Town location and waited about an hour. I will wait any time to eat at Marufuku. I order the chicken Ramen DX(they had a few pest). It was the best dish I have had yet of their ramen. The side of chicken is so darn good and cook perfectly and the ramen bowl is packed with flavor. I ordered the medium spice and was just perfect. Besides the food, the ambiance is great, it is clean, and all the employees are wonderful. I highly highly recommend.,Really nice ramen.  There are quite a few tables inside.  When you walk up just add yourself to the waitlist and you will get a text when your table is ready (just don't wander more than a 5 minute walk away).Chicken Paitan: 4/5.  I have never seen ramen with the white ""paitan"" broth, but now I am a big fan.  Nice satisfying flavor and all of the ingredients are fresh.  The standard dish comes with sliced chicken breast meat which was exactly what I wanted.,Consistently delicious food, fun environment, attentive servers, and good drink options. Even on a Wednesday at 6:30, two groups were ahead of us, though we were lucky and had just a 10 minute wait. It's always a good idea to join the Yelp waitlist in advance, because there's almost always a line.I had the chicken karaage (satisfying though slightly too battered) and hakata tonkatsu dx, medium spicy. Yum. I recommend going dx because the buta kakuni is so extremely tasty, and corn is always nice in ramen. I imagine even the regular version is quite good because the chashu is among the best I've had, and the egg is soft boiled and nicely seasoned.It's worth the wait! Just give them your number and shop while you wait for the text.,Marufuku is THE place to get ramen! Ask any Bay Area local and they have most likely heard of it through Instagram, Tiktok, or even Yelp! Arrival, Service, Waiting: When we first got here, we learned that the wait would be about an hour or so, and decided to put our name down and walk around the shops. Once our table was ready, we were texted and notified that we had 10 minutes to return. Quickly, we were seated at a table meant for 2 but that they had added an extra place setting to make it a table for 3.Menu & Ordering: Their menu is pretty small when it comes to types of ramens, but they have a decent selection when it comes to appetizers. The servers were extremely attentive and able to answer any questions that we had! Food: This ramen had a wonderful depth and feeling of comfort that would be perfect for a cold and rainy winter day! Ambiance: This small shop with close quarters transports me back to Japan on a typical day, filled with strangers who have come together at the same time for a meal. During covid, it would've seemed pretty scary to have the next table only 2 feet away, but under normal operating circumstances, it wasn't bad.,Food - 5Service - 4 Ambiance - 5 Hidden gem in Japan Town. be ready for a long wait, we went on a Sunday afternoon and had to wait 90 mins. The Chashu buns  were soft and full of taste.Spicy Miso Ramen was full of flavors. Chashu Ramen had more meat than I like but no complains. The staff is super busy serving so many people, so they dont have much time but the service was still comparatively quick.Over all I avoid going to their SF location since they opened a new location in Redwood City. But if I am in city next time I would definitely try visiting them again!!Definitely Recommended..,Tried to walk in on a Friday night. Was roughly a 1 hour wait, though Japantown is certainly not the worst place to kill time. I got the tonkatsu ramen. Service was very quick. I considered doing the noodle service but was glad I didn't, as I thought the regular portion was quite filling. I'm certainly not a ramen expert, but this ramen had everything I wanted in a tonkatsu broth -- creamy, perfectly salted, spicy enough, and with great noodles/accompaniements. Price was pretty good as well. Space is a little small if i had to nit-pick, but overall a great dinner.,In terms of ramen, Marufuku Ramen is a San Francisco staple. People from all over the area come to eat their ramen for a reason--myself being one of them! Something about their delicately rich broth, bouncy noodles, and well-seasoned toppings makes your mouth water! I arrived early and checked my family and me in on their Yelp waitlist--a must. The restaurant is extremely popular and notoriously known for its long wait times and lines. For our party of four, it took about 45 minutes, allowing me to walk around Japantown to kill time. Upon entering the restaurant, it's on the smaller side but still somewhat spacious enough with several tables. With that being said, sound travels and it can get quite noisy. The restaurant is popular so they try to turn tables around. As a result, service is attentive but brisk. Our drink orders were taken and provided, our food orders came out hot and fast, and our check came once we were done. My family and I all chose to order our bowls. I frequent and prefer the Oakland location for its ambiance and service. Normally I order the Hakata Tonkotsu but tonight I decided to try the Chicken Paitan with Mild Spice which hit the spot! The chicken broth had a light yet flavorful depth to it, but it was a little on the saltier end. The noodles had a chewy texture and the toppings were fresh. The chicken breast was light and tender. Compared to the Hakata Tonkotsu, the Chicken Paitan isn't as hearty or rich--not leaving me as full. The portion size is enough to fill you up and they give a lot of broth; usually leaving us with leftovers. If you're in the city and craving a good bowl of ramen then I suggest checking Marufuku Ramen out! Service is efficient and the ramen is hearty and delicious. The restaurant is located on the second floor of Japantown across from Kinokuniya Bookstore. Parking is street, metered, or in their paid parking garage. Just be mindful of the long lines and wait times. If that's not your style takeout and delivery is also an option.,This is my 1st time to this one in San Francisco. A completely different experience than their east bay location. I really have to say that the food at this place is incredible perit's pretty cool. It's just as good as the food that I had in their location in Berkeley/ Oakland. It's located easily found in the Japan center off Geary, San Francisco.  It's much smaller than the other one that I go to and I can always tell when I'm getting close because there's always a long line of hungry people waiting to get some of the best ramen ever.. I would recommend you arrive early and get your name on a waiting list so you can get in with your party when it's time for you to eat.Everyone at my table always ordered something different this time I tried the Tan Tan Men.  It was absolutely delicious. The 1st time I ever had it was in Japan and this was a pretty good 2nd place. The noodles are always perfect and I appreciate the fact that they start with a traditional breath that doesn't come in cancer is mass mass quantities made in a kitchen somewhere unknown.Be prepared for it to be very noisy because it's a small place and everyone is having so much fun wh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
le they're eating the chatter level is very high especially if there are children involved because they thrive on loud noise.I would easily come back here again and have some lunch or dinner. The food is always high quality.,Wow! This is the best Ramen I have tasted in San Francisco. The broth is so rich with flavor, the pork belly was so tender and juicy. The egg yolk just squirted all over into my bowl (yalk about a food porn moment). The Ramen is also served in these beautiful bolws and ther service was super quick. I went for lunch and we were so lucky to not experience any lines. I would reccomend others coming during lunch time hours during the week in order to avoid long wait times. Definitely put this place on your food bucket list!,Came here on a Saturday and put our name on the waitlist. Wait time was a little over an hour. It's expected here since the restaurant is kind of small and very popular. Luckily, it's located inside the mall and there's a lot of things to do while you wait. We ordered the chicken karaage as an appetizer. This was delicious. Not too greasy, really nice crunch, and the meat was juicy. Love that the dipping sauce was just Kewpie mayo with a little bit of seasoning. This was really good paired with the ramen.I ordered the Hakata Tonkotsu DX. This was A LOT. I think TOO much. The main difference between this and the non-DX version is that this comes with pork belly. Next time, I might just get the non-deluxe version because I'm not the biggest fan of pork belly to begin with. I also ordered a side of the tofu chasu, which was delicious. But like I said, it was too much for me. I eat with my eyes and not my stomach hahaha.The flavor itself is good! Very umami, creamy broth. Ingredients were fresh. Noodles were a perfect consistency. I loved the corn and soft-boiled egg. Overall, just a good bowl of ramen. Next time," I will try their other """"simpler"""" flavors", because it was a bit overwhelming for me. But it's definitely a must try in Japantown! Service is also really good.,I've been here with my Dragon Boats team for lunch. It's always such a great hit especially after being on a cold water to get a nice big bowl of Ramen. This time however I was on my own and I just wanted something smaller. I ordered the chicken Karaage bowl and the side salad. The chicken Karaage bowl has very generous large chunks of chicken coated with a nice crunchy outside and very tender inside. It is topped off with nori shavings and green onions.  I only wish there were more sesame seeds. I added the optional spice powder to make it have a kick.The salad's soy Sauce-based dressing has a hint of wasabi? It was so good that I also added it to my Karaage chicken rice.Though I appeared at the last half hour of the restaurant's open hours, The staff was courteous though there were several new people for a Wednesday night. Service was a little slow because it seemed only two waiters were on duty.The Karaage bowl was filling enough that I ended up taking half of it home. I asked for an extra serving of the soy sauce-based salad dressing for the rice. It came in a little to go container!,This is one of the best ramen places in the bay area. Service: My boyfriend and I signed up on the waitlist and we waited 1 hr to get a seat. This was just a regular weekend with no events going on but the mall was still packed with people. The staff were extremely kind and patient. We were greeted upon entering the front. We ordered and got our food quickly.Food: My boyfriend got the Hakata Tonkotsu Dx ramen and I got the Hakata Tonkotsu ramen. My bowl was missing the soft boiled egg. The waiter quickly got me one from the kitchen. We both loved our ramen. The noodle was the perfect texture. The meat was cooked perfectly. The soup was rich and flavorful.10/10 recommend if you love ramen! It is definitely worth the wait! It's nice that it's located in a mall because you can shop/walk around while waiting for your table.,This review is  long overdue, but this is one of the best ramen spots in the Bay area. You never wanna go to any other ramen places after this. It definitely set my bar higher for ramen now. Depending on when you go, the line can be very long. Since the times I've been here . I've waited form 15-60 minutes for a seat. You have to check in on the iPad in front of the store. The quality of the food is excellent  and the service is great. The waiter/waitress were very attentive when I went. What I love about this place is the broth, it's one of the most flavorful broth I ever had. The meat and noodles and everything in this bowl of ramen goes well with each other. I prefer this location than the Oakland one. The service here is better and the food taste better. The price can be $$ but it is very worth it.,By far the best chashu that I have ever had in my entire life. My boyfriend and I went here on our trip to San Francisco because one of our friends was raving about the baos and the ramen. We had high expectations for this place and their food exceeded our expectations. The wait was an hour long on a Friday stores, which was expected. Once we got seated the servers were quick and very friendly and our food was out in less than 10 minutes. I cannot emphasize how delicious the chashu bao was. You have to try it when you're here. The deluxe ramen is a must get as well because of the huge piece of chashu they give, in addition to the smaller piece, egg, corn, and bean sprouts. The broth was delicious as well and the noodles seemed endless in the bowl.Must try this place out. I will be coming here again next time I'm in SF!,The best ramen that I've had are all in restaurants in SoCal, so I am always on the search for some decent ramen in the city. The line is always insanely long at Marufuku, so I have never had the chance to try it until now (you just have to COMMIT to the wait, unfortunately). Stopped by on Thursday night for dinner with a friend, and we only had to wait ~35 minutes before seating. Something to note is that although they have a waitlist on their Yelp page, sometimes they close it on the app and you have to join the waitlist in person (iPad at storefront) - this is not that bad of a problem when the rest of the mall is open and you can kill time with exploring the nearby shops, but it was not such a fun time when it's later in the night and you're getting downright hangry and you have no other option but to sit and wait.There is limited seating inside, most of the tables being two-seaters, but we didn't feel extremely rushed in enjoying our meal. I ordered the Hakata Tonkotsu ramen, which comes topped with chashu, a soft boiled ramen egg, green onions, sliced wood ear mushrooms, bean sprouts and garnished with pickled ginger and sesame seeds. The broth was rich and flavorful, covering the ramen noodles with its flavor in every bite. The egg was perfectly soft boiled, with the yolk oozing out creamy goodness when broken into. Although the ramen bowl was smaller than expected, do not be deceived because they PACKED it with noodles (I also enjoyed the asymmetric design of the bowl). Coming at $16, I feel like this was moderately priced for a bowl of SF ramen, given how great the quality and flavors were. Looking forward to coming back here to try the rest of their menu!,Located 2nd floor in the Japan town mall. When our group of 4 arrived there was a pretty big line, we were able to check ourselves in using there self service I pad. The wait was 11 - 21 minutes that flew by, we didn't even have time to get our sake at another location in the shopping center before a text message was sent that our table was ready. We got the drinks to go, unfortunately they did not let us drink our outside drinks (to be expected) So we ordered more drinks :) However the waitress was still helpful and gave us a Pleasent experience. The food, well the food was bomb! Presentation was awesome. My group left tipsy and full of delicious ramen. Long story short, BEST RAMEN IN THE CITY DONT SLEEP ON THIS PLACE.,Food never fails me, it always delivers. Service, make sure you come early to go on waitlist. And the ambiance is great!,Marafuku Ramen here was similar to the location in Irvine for both taste and presentation. Interior is not too large, so if there's a line it may take a long while to get seated. I visited with a group of 4 and there was not a wait at around 4pm. The pacing overall seemed quick though based on how quick the food came out and the servers cleaned up the area. +2 stars for speed and serviceTonkotsu DX noodle was presented nicely. The 'DX' came with everything the regular had plus corn, buta kakuni (braised thick pork belly), and nori seaweed. For a few dollars more, the DX is a better deal in my opinion. The broth was creamy/rich and the toppings paired well with it. The egg was soft boiled, which was done right. The egg from when I tried in the irvine location was nearly all hard boiled. The noodles were  'ultra-thin' as described. It paired well with the tonkotsu broth. +1.5 stars overall, but portions was bit small for the priceMy brother ordered the Karaage Bowl. I tried a piece of chicken and it was hot/fresh and crispy. It came with rice, located under the chicken. The portion size was much better value for the price. +.5 stars,As always, SF is so busy! Having waited around 40min for a table, our group of 6 sat in their center seating. The staff was decently attentive and provided great explanations of all the menu items! As a table, we ordered the ika karaage and fried shishito peppers. Each of us got a bowl of ramen as well! The ika karaage was alright and was crispy! It had a small Mayo and spicy sauce which was a nice addition. While the shishito peppers had a great sweet flavor with their sweet sauce as well. Soon, the ramen came out almost all at the same time. They were pretty good about identifying who ordered what bowl. The DX tonkotsu ramen has additional ramen toppings and was the same as the norm tonkotsu ramen. There was no difference in taste or many other differences aside from the additional corn topping. Other items like the chicken  ramen looked good too! My of my group members ordered it. Overall, the ramen was as expected as ramen and had a good, rich broth and nice chewy noodles! The experience was good and the food was great! It was fun to try it once, but with it's more limited menu I would probably not come again. I would suggest this restaurant to ramen lovers!,My brother and I finally got to try this infamous ramen place. We came here on a weekday for lunch. After putting our name on the Yelp waitlist, we still had to wait for 45 minutes. Thankfully, the weather was nice out, so we strolled around the Japantown Plaza and checked out the shops around the plaza.Once seated, our food came out quickly after ordering. We both got the Hakata Tonkotsu, which is a unique handmade ramen exclusive to Marafuku. We also shared the chicken karage, which was nicely crispy. Service was great and the interior decor was pretty.,I had been wanting to try this spot for so long and I finally got around to it. Downside: we waited about an hour and we were soo hungry. I think there's a way to join the yelp waitlist ahead of time, so I suggest doing that. We ordered the gyoza and the spicy tan tan ramen that had ground chicken. The ramen was soo good. I'm picky with my ramen but this hit the spot. The broth was super flavorful and just the right amount of spice. It was also creamy which I prefer. I would definitely go back but the long wait times makes me a bit hesitant.,I came here on a Sunday for a bit of a late lunch. We joined the Yelp waitlist and waited around 30 minutes. It's nice to walk around the mall and there's lots to see if you need that kind of distraction like I do when I'm hungryI got the chicken paitan and this is the first time I've had chicken broth that was really flavorful with a deep flavor that wasn't overwhelming. The chicken breast was really tender and the flavors all mixed so wonderfully together. I also loved how thin the ramen noodles were. I finished the whole bowl and absolutely loved itI'm knocking down a star for service. When the server delivered the ramen for myself and the person I was with, both bowls had quite a spillage as it was transported and then placed on our table. I know the bowls could be hefty but I felt like the waiters were so rushed and just slapped it down,Wow!!  What a line to get into this place. Portion was a bit small but very filling. This place had a line on a Wednesday afternoon. If you don't believe my review, the line to get in says it all.,I ordered the Hakata Tonkatsu. The broth was unctuous enough. The noodle were the thin kind that I don't like as much as the wavy/chewy kind. The pork belly was insanely tender and fall apart.Overall a good bowl of ramen. I've had better, I've had worse. I felt like it could have used more seasoning.,Hands down, the best ramen that you can get without being in Japan itself. Marafuku is always packed for a reason!I always go with the Chicken Paitan ramen which consists of chicken paitan broth, noodles, green onion, soft boiled egg, and chashu chicken. They got several levels of spice but I usually go mild. My favorite part is the milky feeling broth. It's packed with so much flavor and you can straight up drink it on its own. I like to add corn on mine as well.Their noodles are super fresh too and have a nice bite. I recommended eating it in the restaurant if you can since it'll be more fresh. However, I will say that seating is super tight so be prepared to be seating next to strangers. Pro tip: order an extra side of noodles for your left over broth ;),Intro: We were driving near the area when we found that Marufuku didn't have too long of a wait on the waitlist so we immediately switched destinations. We had to wait a short while for a party of 4 but nothing too bad considering how long it usually gets.Food: I ordered the Hakata Tonkotsu DX. The ramen was definitely delicious - the broth was rich, the noodles were plentiful, and the toppings were excellent. The Tonkotsu wasn't dry at all and was very flavorful in and of itself. While it is good, I definitely would not wait as long as you would normally have to wait for the place. Tl;dr: Delicious ramen place but if the line is too long I personally would skip. My rating: 7/10,The seasonal ramen tastes excellent, and I especially like the spicy flavor. I also ordered chicken karage and takoyaki, which tasted good but were not impressive. The service there is great. The staff always serves you with a warm smile and will help you to find a comfortable spot to sit (the space inside is limited).The only thing I may complain about is the wait time. Usually, it's 1hr during lunchtime, but the good thing is we can use yelp to join the waitlist before we arrive.,Came around 4:20 and added myself to the waitlist with my family and we were called about an hour later. This restaurant is in the kinokuniya building on the upper level across from Sophie's crepes. Service was quick and the food was super tasty. I especially loved the chashu buns which were very soft and easy to chew.,If youre looking for a quality ramen in san fransisco this place will not disappoint you ive been here 3 times in a row and each time the service is excellent  considering this place is a very busy place and popular . So on all the visit i had the specialty pork ramen and the chicken ramen;  you can taste that they take pride in making the broth the quality is so good and comforting the noodles is cooked perfectly not over cooked like other places that ive been in the area also i recommend to substitute the regular ramen to spinach ramen noodles for variation. Ambiance is really cozy and open i will definitely come back to this place,Ramen was Delish...!Broth had a great taste.Noodles were cooked to perfection.And service was great too.I highly recommend this place.It's busy, busy so expect to wait a bit.But it's worth it.Happy Ramen hunting!I can't wait to go back.!,Don't think I'd love ramen as much if it wasn't for eating here. Best broth I've ever tasted and the bowls are decent size. I will say it is pretty pricey if you get appetizers drinks etc bill for two after tip goes up about 65-75$ But the ramen is worth it. I'd say you don't even really need appetizers cause the bowl itself is filling. Expect to wait long 30-45 min waitlist  but early in the week it's not too bad. Staff is great constantly picking up little trash and filling the water. When I tried it the first time I think I ate like 5 times there in the first month lol. I love that they're on door dash for delivery.,Returned to Marufuku this afternoon and had a great experience. I had been prior to the pandemic and getting in early was a plus, not a long wait yet i have seen long waits over the past year! Now the good stuff, i had the Spicy Tantan men which was SPICY yet savory and a treat!! The broth was savory, grounded spicy pork was over the top, noodles thick yet foregiving and just amazing. I also tried the limited Chicken Ramen bowl the came with a sizzling chicken leg that was savory and smokey with all spice. The chicken leg was not as tender as i had hoped yet passable. The chicken karrage bowl was savory and delicious! Overall i would rate the experience at a 9 at best as i frequent many ramen restaurants and this is not the best in my opinion yet one of my top three! m,Craving ramen?! Marufuku in Japantown will definitely satiate that crave! Best ramen in SF. This is my go to spot; hits the comfort zone consistently. It's all about the Hakata Tonkotsu! The warm delicious pork-based broth, simmered w love, ramen cooked al dente w tender slices of chashu, and the perfectly cooked egg w oozing yolk makes me smile. Mmmm... mmm good!  Slurp away (no judgment zone)!*visit off-peak hours to avoid the wait.,Excellent ramen, hands down the best I've had in the states. Great customer service, our waitress was super attentive and offered booster seat immediately upon seeing our baby. Not too small of an area. Will definitely come here just for the ramen and to try other dishes.,$26 for a bowl of the Hakata Tonkotsu DX (including tax & tip). Came on a Friday at 11am and there was 10 people waiting only. Got seated right away and my bowl came out in 5 mins. Heard this was one of the best ramen shop in SF. I'll be going to Japan next month so I'll be judging how Marufuku compares to ramen in Japan In the past, I've tried other top ramen places in the US region ex: Nagi Ramen (LA), Taishoken (SF), Shin-Shen Gumi (LA), Ramen Ryujin (Sac), Totto Ramen (NY), Killer Noodle (LA) and I would say for my personally taste," Marufuku ranks in the middle of the pack. But probably because I'm """"meh"""" when it comes to Tonkotsu ramens. Probably the best to Tonkotsu ramen I ever had though??",My friend and I came here on a Sunday late morning for an early lunch. I joined the Yelp Waitlist when we were close enough to the restaurant, and we were seated shortly after arriving. It can get pretty crowded here, so I definitely recommend adding yourself to the waitlist when close.Food:I ordered the vegetable ramen. It came with a variety of vegetables, braised (?) tofu, and a soft boiled egg. The tofu was done very well and differently to how I am used to in my vegetarian ramen! Service:Service was friendly and quick. They were pretty busy, so the servers were constantly running around. However, we got our order in shortly after sitting down, and our food came out rather quickly. You can tell this restaurant is a well-oiled machine on quick service since they get so busy! There was a long line of people waiting by the time we were done.TL;DR - delicious ramen with fast turnaround times, make sure to add yourself on the Yelp Waitlist!,This ramen shop is definitely worth all the hype and the wait! The broth in the tonkotsu ramen was incredibly flavourful - the perfect balance of salt, richness and spice (I got 4/5 stars). The thinner noodles were really well cooked and still held their weight in the dish. I would put this place in my regular rotation if we had one back home. The only mild form of criticism I have is that I wish the egg was more seasoned (the menu says it is but it just tasted like a soft boiled egg to me). Didn't take away from the experience of the dish though, it was that good. I would also personally get the regular tonkotsu over the deluxe next time as the braised pork belly was too thick and fatty for my liking, although if you like those two things you should def get it - my husband loved the thicker pork belly.  They still include the regular pork belly in the deluxe, which was perfect - so tender and flavourful. We also got the chashu buns and all I can say is please do yourself a favour and DO NOT SLEEP ON THESE. They are straight fire. Incredible little pockets of heaven. I don't usually comment on service in my reviews but it deserves a mention because everyone who works here is so thorough, polite and friendly - we felt really well taken care of the entire time. Lastly, we were 63rd in line on Yelp but as others have mentioned, don't let this deter you - the line moves quick (we were seated in an hour from when we put our names on the list). The mall offers a ton of incredible dining/perusing options to pass the time while you wait!,Make a Yelp reservation before you go!! Waited 1.5 hours for a table for 2 on a Sunday afternoon. Luckily there is plenty to see at the mall to kill the time. It's located on the 2nd floor inside the mall, very small interior, hence the long wait. The food actually came out in less than 5 minutes but it is time consuming to eat so that held us up for a bit. This was by far the best veggie ramen I have ever had. The vegetarian broth was so flavorful, the egg was perfectly cooked, and there were so many fresh veggies! There's even an option for extra noodles to load up your broth for another round. Add-ons are available for a low cost. Medium spice was a perfect medium. The menu is on the smaller side but you can really fill up on just one bowl of ramen. One suggestion would be to bring out a shot of hot broth to refresh your bowl when you add extra noodles, it was cold by the time we got to the half way point. There are no restrooms in or near this shop, they are located across the bridge. Would return.,I had high expectations for Marufuku and I think it was pretty good. I think the broth was missing some flavor but still good. The noodles had a great texture and clinged onto the broth well. I don't remember the chashu or egg (egg is not marinated) being standout. We got there close to closing time so luckily there was no wait. Friendly and fast service. Beautifully decorated and great ambiance.,I was very excited to try this place after hearing so much about it. Located in the heart of Japan town, this ramen shop offers a great experience, with friendly hosts, and delicious food. We waited about 20 min for a table, although *protip* we could've joined the Yelp waitlist earlier and skipped much of the waiting. That's on us. There are plenty of places to wait at so it wasn't bad at all. We were greeted in a friendly manner and had a quick rundown of the menu. We ordered the pork buns and two bowls of ramen- spicy hakata tonkotsu ramen for me. I think the spice level was just perfect. Any more and I would've been coughing a lot! The pork was extra tender, and the broth was incredible. I think the only wish I had was that it had thicker noodles. I recommend this! Great place,Marufuku Ramen is the perfect place to stop at when you're in Japantown. It was one of the first ramen places I went to when I moved into the city and it made me feel right at home. I've tried multiple dishes before but did not feel like writing a review until I branched out and tried the vegetable ramen. Which is not something I'd conventionally go for ( I generally get the Hakata DLX) but it exceeded all my expectations!!The broth was savory yet had those vegetable hints that made the ramen feel homey. The tofu was a great substitution and I felt that I didn't miss out on getting pork belly like I usually get in my ramen. The gyoza was nothing special in my opinion and the pork buns weren't the best I had. But they were still great and something to try.Expect to wait 30 mins and above for a spot, especially on the weekends . But what is perfect about it is that you can explore the shopping center while you wait and bask in the Japanese culture by stopping by the bookstore, stationary store, and art stores. Maybe even do grocery shopping next door at Nijiya Market if you have lots of time.,"As one reviewer said """"worth the hype"""".  The chicken and pork versions are both delicious.  This is so good. The broth is rich and not too salty. The noodles are perfect. It is so good!!",There are multiple versions of ramen and one place is rarely the same with another. If you like creamy, rich, and smooth broth, Marafuku is the place for you. It's not greasy or overly salty.  I got the Tonkotsu DX.  My bowl had corn, seaweed, mushroom, egg. But the star of the show was their cut of thick pieces of mouth-watering pork cha-shu. Tender, salty, and fatty, their pork perfectly compliments their broth as well as all their other Ingredients.   The only downside was their ramen egg. Usually this is marinated in dark soy but it came out bright white. Even so, the egg was still cooked perfectly through. Not that you need my recommendation given all the other positive reviews for this place, but definitely give this place a try.  You won't regret it.,Pretty solid hakata style ramen in the Bay Area. So this place is located in Jtown in SF, so you know parking is gonna be hard to find unless you pay for it. Otherwise take public transportation. This place is located on the 2nd floor in the mall. Because this place is a popular place expect a wait. For a Friday night dinner I made a reservation at 5pm, planning to eat at 7pm. So USE THAT WAITLIST feature to plan ahead. Best of luck if you walk up because the wait is long. I know that my reservation got bumped up 30 min faster than when I was intending to come, so I gave a rang and they honored my reservation as long as my whole party arrived. If you do not want to wait, then do the take out. The location is decently size and service is very attentive. This place is not exactly a take your time type of sit down location, as this place gets busy and trying to get people seated.So the food... if you can plan ahead do it. For appetizers my table got the Ika karaage, shishito peppers, and takoyaki. All were really good! So if you like appitizer and have space do it. The ramen was pretty good rich broth. I got the deluxe and I enjoyed pork belly. I like hakata style noodles which is pretty good and at the perfect firmness. In another visit, I got to enjoy the pork buns. The buns are loaded. So I recommend trying them if you want to pork buns. If you have time and willing to wait, this place is great.,Great ramen option for SF!For SF, Marufuku has good ramen (I think socal has better). The food, service, and ambiance were all great. Food comes out fast. The waiters are super kind and greet you. Overall, a great restaurant.Things to know: They do Yelp waitlist. Even though it looks super crowded, I find the line goes pretty quickly. At least you're at mall. So, you can shop around. Tip: If you're into sharing, get the chicken paitan dx. The grilled chicken leg is great for sharing. Food: All the ramens are good. You can go wrong with any you choose. I don't think the spicy level is that spicy. It's not runny nose level of spice. I do prefer medium spice. Meat is always tender every time I go. The quality and consistency of their ramen is top notch.,Love this place! Finally brought my nephew and sister. Boys got extra spicy and we survived. The staff is so sweet! For me ramen is about noodles like these, so I got the refill of noodles! What can I say, worth the wait:),Unfortunately, they did not have the Yelp waitlist on.  We got lucky and didn't have to wait more than 20 minutes. This is my favorite ramen because the broth. We ordered the homemade gyozas to start off. It's a very small restaurant so they are a bit pushy on getting you to wrap up. Not a place to linger at.,Ramen was really good. It's not salty like other ramen shops.  I would say that the food was really good. And it's a great location in Japantown SF.  You can shop than have your lunch or dinner right after. We waited 1 hr and a half for this!!  As a tourist visiting SF, does everyone have the time to wait this long?  I say not which is why I give it 3 stars for the food only. I got lectured by my party as it was my choice to stick to the plan. They would rather have Udon which is near to it.  Just a point of advice, go get yourself on the waitlist in Yelp than go walk around this,way you don't have to wait as long.,Best ramen place in San Francisco. I've been to Japan several times and the taste here is perfectly the same as I had in Japan.,It's good. It's good ramen for sure. The location is tough as it's in the northwest corner of the second floor of Japan town. The place seats maybe 30 people max and they can move you through FAST. Super busy at peak times but you can get in quick at off hours. They don't do reservations so don't call, they use waitlist so you check in when you're there or close and it'll add you to the line. Service is prompt and fast!,Some of the best Ramen!  We love coming here 1x week!  Try the miso with dums Thanks for the food!,Hello  I'm from palms springs area and I have never experienced such a amazing customer service, food or atmosphere like this place. It's absolutely delicious ! I ordered spicy Pork ramen and my Husband ordered their special that they only make 15 plates of the special. Once it runs out, there's no more! I highly recommend and this is now my new Ramen spot anytime I come to SF.,A1 service. A1 vibe. A1 food.Keeping it short and simple for this modern japanese ramen spot. It's a hardcore recommend. I'm still thinking about that broth.,Wow, just wow! The ramen is sooooooo worth the long wait!! The best ramen I've had since visiting Japan! Tucked in a small shopping strip in Japantown, you'll find Marufuku on the second floor upstairs corner. They don't take reservations but you check in via app at the host booth. For a group of three on a Friday evening we waited about 1.5 hours. We wasted time walking through Japantown and browsing through the open shops, and even had soft serve from a place downstairs. But save your appetite for this ramen! Soooo gooodd!,Good food. I had the deluxe pork ramen. Tender pork chashu and belly. Savory broth. But the star is clearly the bouncy noodles, perfectly cooked with the right toothsome texture. Good service and a great way to celebrate. Ps: we went at an odd time (4.30 on Wednesday) so no wait. But I've seen a line almost every other time I've passed by.,It's only logical to grab some ramen to enjoy in Japantown! The egg was the most well-cooked egg I think I've had in my life, you can tell they have it down to a science!The broth was a little fatty for my taste, but overall a very delicious experience. Factor in the wait, it was about two hours on a Saturday night.Taste: 4/5Smell: 5/5Sight: 5/5Touch: ???Sound: ???,There's a reason this place has long wait lines. Very small menu, basicly chicken broth, pork broth, vegetable broth, and the seasonal special (which is pork). I got the Tonkatsu DX, date got the seasonal special. The seasonal special was sooooo rich and delicious; I can't wait to go back and get my own bowl!!!! Also very polite and attentive s,The first time I stopped by there was a long wait but fortunately I was able to get a seat on the next try. I ordered the takoyaki for an appetizer. Very tasty and the octopus cooked well and not too chewy. I got the paitan DX because I was intrigued by a chicken leg as a side to ramen. The chicken leg was my fav of the entire meal. Grilled well yet still juicy with a sweet soy flavor and the ramen was hearty with a creamy texture. It was a sizable portion and I ended up taking most of the ramen home after eating all of the chicken.,With all the hype about this place, I had really high expectations but was left underwhelmed! It wasn't bad at all, but it wasn't memorable. Maybe it's just not my type of ramen, but it tasted like something I could've gotten elsewhere without a long wait or at least with some customization. If you like Ramen Nagi, I would stick to that instead. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here unless a friend really wanted to try it. HAKATA TONKOTSU: 3.5/5The broth had flavor, but the tonkotsu was very light in taste. I would've preferred a more rich pork broth or more garlic. I ordered this at medium spice and had to add a decent amount more to better enjoy the broth. The chashu was alright but nothing special. One nice thing is that a whole soft-boiled egg is included in the $16 bowl, when most places usually include only a half or charge you for an entire egg. For additional spice after ordering your spice level, I was expecting a spicy paste or oil to add in. But, there instead is a little container with what seemed like cayenne pepper in a jar, which was disappointing for a quality restaurant like this. My friend did enjoy his Chicken Paitan DX, which is a limited quantity item (only 15 bowls made per day). I thought the broth was good but not my taste, but the grilled chicken leg that came with it was amazing! It had a really yummy, sweet marinade.,This used to be my favorite to-go ramen spot in SF, but after coming for so long, it doesn't feel like it anymore.When you arrive, you need to put your name down on the IPad For the Yelp Reservation. You can't do it online; only in person. So it's almost a guaranteed 30min-1hr wait on a weekday after work. We came after 30 minutes when it said we were first in line, but then we still have to wait another 15 min as multiple groups (4+ per group) got seated ahead of us. Once seated, it took the staff 20 minutes to finally come around to us and take our order. This quality of service is common here; happened to be a few times.I asked for a hot tea to start off, and the waitress brought me lukewarm tea. I swear. Not even hot! You can tell just feeling the outside of the cup that it wasn't not. So I asked her if she could please bring hot tea. And so she fixed it.I ordered the karaage bowl because I remembered this place having the crunchiest and most delicious karaage I've had. However, when it came out the karaage was a bit soggy; so you can tell it wasn't freshly fried. It was a bit of a disappointment because I used it like it more than the ramen. All in all, the quality of service has been consistently bad and the quality of food is not always up to par. Wish it was better for how much you have to wait to be seated.,Hands down some of the best ramen I have ever had!  Not only was the food exquisite the staff was also very welcoming!We had a group of six of us and all ordered similar plates with additional fried chicken and dumplings as sides.   The ramen came out quickly and was packed with so much flavor!  If you ever have an opportunity to come here do it!  It's worth the travel and potential wait.,Perfect place for tourists, but I live here.I'm giving it 3 stars for the speed, kindness and efficiency of the staff. But waiting 2 hours for ok ramen is not my idea of a fun Saturday evening.BBBAFC,After a foggy adventure in SF, all I was craving was a hot bowl of ramen. Marufuku was the first place that popped up after a quick search. Upon arrival it was PACKED out the door!The first good sign. We joined the waitlist and walked around to look for a backup option, but something just felt like we had to go here. I am so glad to have waited. Every bite from appetizer to entree was DELICIOUS and packed with flavor. If pork is your jam... grab all the pork options here because I'm pretty sure there is magic in the meat. Bonus:Every single person working was smiling and attentive. Our water was never empty, plates came and went faster than I could ever ask for with a growling stomach and we received so many welcomes and thank you's that it added that extra special touch to eating somewhere new. I'll be bringing everyone I know back here!,Over the past 5 years I think the ramen bowls have been going down in taste? Not sure if anyone else noticed this. Service is great, you will feel a bit rushed," since they always have a line out the door. I recommend checking in and then going around and exploring the shops in the plaza (wait is really long).""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bottega,"Pretty good. We had to wait a while but overall good service. I had the lasagna and although I didn't have any expectations it was really yummy,They were amazing! My daughter celebrated her Birthday with a group of her friends and our waitress was great. Very Tall and kind brunette. It is a very cool & instagram picture perfect place. The food was delicious!! The only issue was not the restaurant at all, but the streets outside. I grew up in that area, and was shocked by the tents and homeless that has developed over the last 5 years. I had to try and find a spot without tents to park! Our mayor is ruining SF! So many great ice cream shops, bars and restaurants trying to make it in the mission. Even though there was a dessert shop less than a block away, we drove to another part of SF to walk around and shop after dinner. What a shame. Sad to see my neighborhood so out of control. Do it for the excellent service, beautiful interior and food, but not to stroll around after dinner.,This place is definitely worth checking out, just please be warned that on Friday and the weekends... the wait times can be long. The place is not that big and seems like it's mostly parties of 2 or 4, so coming with a big group will be a wait. We came on a Friday night with a party of 6 and we had to wait outside for an hour or so. Since we were waiting outside for awhile, the bar manager came and took our drink order so we can get our night started. Overall the food is delicious and not badly priced for what you get, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable. For food we ordered was the calamari, waffle fries, lasagna, spaghetti with meatballs, fettuccine alfredo with chicken, chicken special with gluten free penne, build your own pasta. I'm glad that they offer gluten free pasta so that people who are GF have an option to eat. I feel like a lot of Italian places don't have GF options. We all enjoyed the food we ordered and we also ordered a few rounds of shots on top of the cocktails we ordered earlier.If you're in the Mission District and want some Italian food, I would definitely recommend this place. It's a cute date spot if you're looking for a date night and good drinks.,This is a 3 1/2 star review, rounded up to 4. This restaurant is perhaps a case of style over substance, which will appeal to some more than it did for me. You can instagram your heart out. It is gorgeous but somewhat impractical. The seats are metal and in addition to being cold are wildly uncomfortable, like sitting on an oven rack. But they are copper and look very chic. Overall the food was good. I had the gnocchi, which I liked. We also got lasagne, which wasn't so good and garlic bread, which was not the indulgent buttery splurge you envision when you think of garlic bread but more of a minimalist approach. 4 very small, thin pieces of toast with a little garlic flavor and a lot of arugula. Garlic bread is probably not actually an Italian food, so I don't think this is a more authentic version. A more modern and healthy version? But who orders garlic bread to be healthy?We also got a pizza with was oddly burned and underdone at the same time. Some of the salami was charred and some seemed like they had added it after they cooked the pizza. That being said, the flavor of the pizza was great. This seems like a really fun place to come for a date or with your friends after work.I would go back but my friends said not so much.,I had dinner with one of my friends few weeks ago and glad I finally got to try this place! I've seen it all over Instagram story and it was definitely on my bucket list. First of all, no reservations. They only take walk-ins and you can put yourself on the waitlist and walk around till your name gets called. Our wait time said 30-45 minutes but it actually was only 20 minutes! (YAY!) What we ordered: - Brussels sprouts - Mezzemaniche Boscaiola- Calzone All very delicious!! This was a bit too much carbs for 2 people but you can take it home and heat it up again for next day. The mezzemaniche was my favorite and the flavorful. It went well with our drinks! Calzone also was tasty with the mushrooms, salami, onions, mozzarella cheese! Super cheesy! (Haha get it?) Anyways, we enjoyed our night and I can't wait to try their other menu next time!,Came here on a Sunday evening around 5:30 PM and got seated immediately for a party of 5. It did seem like more parties were trickling in as the evening progressed, so there might be a wait if you come during peak hours, but it didn't seem like there was a line when we left. They give you complementary focaccia bread, which was absolutely amazing. We kept chomping down on this, and I think our server refilled it at least 3 times for it. The first couple rounds of focaccia that we got had tomatoes and then the latter half of the rounds had mushrooms. Both were lovely. It's good that they have this because it did take a while for our orders to come out. When our orders did come out, the server also came around with a giant black pepper grinder, which is definitely picture worthy! They even let my friend hold it so he could take a picture with it. They will also grate parmesan for you too if you'd like. I ordered the Prosciutto Pizza. It came on a chopping board, precut into squares. The crust is thin but strong enough to hold the toppings. The prosciutto and burrata were delicious and are always a classic combo. The burrata is definitely a heavy cheese though, so I found myself getting pretty full after a couple slices (not to mention all the focaccia I ate beforehand), but that just meant I could eat the leftovers for another meal. My only complaint is that the crust did taste a little overdone to the point where it was and tasted burnt. Ambiance-wise, this place was dimly lit with individual lamps on each table (which are adjustable in terms of brightness). The decor is lovely and would be a great date spot or good for a special celebration (and of course, regular dining as well). The service was phenomenal; the servers were attentive, and they kept refilling our waters without us asking. Overall, it was a good experience, and I would come again, especially for that focaccia bread!,We had decided the morning of to go out for dinner . I found this spot on google . I immediately called to ask for reservations and was greeted by a nice Italian lady who answered the phone by saying ""buongiorne."" I found out they do walk ins only and The lady on the phone suggested to come in at 5 pm to secure a table . Bottega had a very fun atmosphere, love the design of the restaurant. But the thing that sticks out the most was the service. Our waitress went above and beyond . She was attentive,fun and explained the menu! The food was very good as well . I had the salmon fettuccine and the rest of my party ordered pizzas. Food looked so good - I dug into my plate before I could snap a pic ! The only reason I gave this place a 4 star was because there was a wet dog smell or street smell perhaps upon entering . I'm going to guess it was the wet carpet because of all the rain fall . Not a huge deal but gives the impression that the restaurant isn't clean .,I've been wanting to try this place since it opened and we decided to walk in on a Friday night and waited around 30~ minutes to get seated. The atmosphere is cute and trendy. It seems like an excellent place for a birthday or date night. We ordered the Funghi Bruschetta, Mezzelune Ai Porchini, and Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with pink sauce and without English peas. I enjoyed everything we ordered and am excited to try more dishes in the future! Overall, I really enjoyed my visit to Bottega!,I was in the mission and was looking for a spot for dinner. I've seen TikTok's about this specific spot but never got around to trying it until now. My friend and I didn't have a reservation and were able to get seated pretty quickly. The staff were super friendly and welcoming and their energy echoes throughout the entire restaurant. My friend and I ordered the lasagna and margarita pizza to share because we wanted carbs. I'd say it was pretty average. The pizza was a bit burnt and the lasagna was a little bland. I think you're best off going to Trattoria Da VittorioTrattoria Da Vittorio in a west portal for authentic Italian food.,Came here on a Wednesday night with some friends! I've been dying to try this place but always ended up waiting in line and giving up :-(Luckily there wasn't a wait or a line so we were seated immediately upon arrival. Our server was really kind and gave us their recommendations for food and wine, they checked in a lot on us and made sure we were all set!We ordered the margarita pizza, Caesar salad, the truffle mushroom ravioli, and the tomato bruschetta! From the complimentary bread and oil to the salad to the pasta everything was so delicious! The food was really good without being heavy, the food also came out really fast which was a huge plus cause although there wasn't a wait they were pretty busy! I would definitely come here again! Really glad I got to finally try,10/10 service 10/10 food 10/10 ambiance10/10 cocktails This place is a MUST go! Everything was delicious from the Caesar salad, mushroom bruschetta, all the pastas and the pizzas! The vibes are immaculate. This was the perfect place to spend my brothers birthday and the servers made it so much better.,Came here for dinner on a weekday and there was no wait! The restaurant is on a busy street but there is street parking on side streets which was fine on a weekday. The inside of the restaurant is really cute and had a classy feel to it. Our waiter took the time to go over the specials and answer our questions about different items on the menu. Had to wait a bit for the food to come out though, maybe around 20-30 min. The pasta was delicious and the sauces were so creamy. I really enjoyed the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola dish with the pink sauce which is tomato sauce and white sauce together. The gnocchi with black truffle sauce had an amazing flavor, but the gnocchi could've been a little softer. The lasagna was really tasty as well and tasted homemade. Would definitely come back again!,I discovered Bottega during Covid and have only ordered take-out from here.   I was pregnant at the time and was really craving Italian food, since then my coworkers and I order every couple weeks to get our comfort food fix. I usually order from here for lunch and typically get the same thing. I order the burrata caprese salad and a kid's size portion of pasta. I absolutely love burrata and will almost order it every time I see it. The kid size is about a half portion of homemade mezzemaniche served with a choice of sauce, which is typically the meat sauce or alfredo. You can also add meatballs to it to make it a heartier meal. I have also tried their pizza and lasagna, which were also good. Give them a try!,Love the area & love the vibe. Decor was beautiful. All the staff members were so passionate and friendly. The food was absolutely amazing! MUST = Mezzemaniche Boscaiola (with pink sauce)Really, everything was quite delicious and I don't think you can go wrong. Other notables: Prosciutto E Burrata Pizza, Salsiccia E Funghi Pizza, Bruschetta, Funghi bruschetta, and can't forget the free bread (just amazing). Crab cakes, though tasty were super tiny. No ressies but can join waitlist via Yelp.,Gnocchi with truffle cream: so good! I dreamm about this dish.Rigatoni: the meat was delicious, i chose a tomato sauce but I think I will order with tomato cream next time because i LOVED how savory the gnocchi with truffle cream was.Superb service!Right across the street from CCSF!,Not only is this one of the cutest restaurants but the food is actually insanely delicious. I went a few times the month they opened and the staff was so incredibly nice. Has a great open floor plan with vibrant colors and lovely decor. They offer this delicious focaccia bread that is to die for. My favorite dishes are the sausage and peas pasta with pink sauce and the artichoke pizza (forgetting the names). These are a MUST. so freaking good. Cant wait to come back again.,Ordered DoorDash, food was pretty good but with room to be better. Wanted some protein so looked for meat options but there weren't too many to pick from, so I added chicken to my pasta order. I'm sure the ambiance and vibes are great but I cannot comment on that. Alongside my pasta, I got some parmesan, chili flakes, and bread with sun dried tomatoes. Price wise, it's slightly higher for the portion size, but I imagine the ambiance and service would make up for the small increase.Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken - the fettuccine was amazing. Perfect al dente and creamy. I would've liked more sauce for the bread included, because there wasn't a lot to work with, but the flavor was great. Chicken however, was pretty average. Cooked alright, seared a bit, and just tossed in.,3.5 stars rounded up for the staff once we got seats. We went on a Saturday night, which I knew would be busy. So we put our name on the wait list before leaving the house and got there at the beginning of the time window yelp gave as an estimate about 30 minutes later. We got there and checked in and there was only one 2-person party ahead of us, so seemed like we would be seated soon ish. They kept saying they're cleaning off two spots at the bar for us but then a bunch of staff members were walking back and forth and in and out and it took 20 more minutes to actually get seated. I know they were busy but there wasn't anyone sitting in those bar seats the whole time they were cleaning them off so just seemed a little ridiculous that it took so long to get seated when there were seats available and tons of staff roaming around. Now, once we got in, I loved the vibe. Very Florence night club with some EDM and flashing lights. Not enough to be distracting and we were able to still talk just fine with only a couple ""what?""s. But just be prepared that is the vibe. Young and trendy. Most of the servers were speaking Italian and seemed to be related? Not all to each other but definitely like 2 families. They were all very cool and friendly and attentive once we got in. Just seemed to be having a good time and ensuring that their guests did too. My partner's lasagna was pretty terrific. Looked like an old family recipe handed down from Nonna and tasted like it too. Really well done. For my lobster ravioli, I liked the sauce a lot. Think they did a great job. The ravioli itself seemed like the same texture as the refrigerated ravioli you get at the store. So not bad but not restaurant quality. Overall would come back again. It seemed like a spot for a lot of birthday parties and people dressing up for a night out.,Unfortunately the high expectations I had of this place were not met, in terms of food taste.Our server was a peppy lad who was attentive to us and evidently saw the hunger in our eyes as he kept offering to top our bread up. The bread was the best thing since sliced br-. It was the best thing.Which is unfortunate, while my party thought the amatriciana, crabcakes and special risotto were mediocre at best, we loved the free bread. Portions were also not great (except the seemingly endless bread)Ambience was nice too but not what I came here for,What a gem of a spot! Not only is the restaurant super cute & well decorated, their food is *chef's kiss*. I would come back even just for the focaccia bread, it was amazing. The bruschetta pomodori was fresh, and the toppings plentiful. The pink sauce with the gnocchi was filling and hearty, and the mezzelune ai porcini's truffle cream was delicious. The service was impeccable - everyone was incredibly friendly and attentive. There is one gender neutral bathroom with a baby changing station in the back of the restaurant.,So Great! I found this place with a friend after our original place was closed but that was the best thing that could have happened! We came at around 8:30 pm on a Friday and found about a ~20 minute wait which isn't too bad, and was super helpful that they have a Yelp waitlist feature!Upon being seated, you are just immersed in the great ambiance and energy from the people around you. We sat at the bar and found it to be fine to talk without it being too loud. The bartender was awesome and had lots of thoughts on good drinks and even made up a cool take on a Moscow Mule for my taste.As for the food, it was great, we started with the Cavoletti Di Bruxelle which was SO GOOD, probably the best Brussels sprouts I've ever had, just a perfect start. For the entree I ordered the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with the pink sauce, and it was so rich with flavor I was really impressed. I honestly don't have any complaints about the food at all which is pretty rare I think. It was all OUTSTANDING! In summary, the vibes and energy, combined with the food quality and presentation created a really hard to beat experience that I highly encourage anybody to eat here!,Oh em gee. Bottega has become one of my top Italian spots in the city. Currently does not take any reservations, but you can easily join their waitlist on their yelp page.We ordered their crab cakes, pomodori bruschetta, lasagna, and the mezzemaniche boscaiola with pink sauce. Their crab cakes weren't as big as we expected and the spice most definitely came with a kick. Start your meal off with the bruschetta as a refreshing appetizer. Our server recommended the lasagna and compared it to his grandmother's recipe. The star of the show for me was the mezzemaniche. The rigatoni was cooked al dente and the pink sauce was super creamy. Italian sausage and the cooked peas paired well with this dish.Only downfall for me was the music was a little to loud for my liking, I caught myself having to lean over to be able to speak. Also, one of our glasses was a little murky. The team was busy, but will definitely address the issue next time.,I really loved our lunch at Bottega!I took my mom here for her birthday and we had a great time. We walked in around 1:30pm on a Sunday and waited less than 5 min for a table. Service was wonderful and the complimentary focaccia was so good (they constantly refilled this throughout our meal without us needing to ask). Portion sizes were good for the price point and everything we ordered was tasty. Out of the three pastas we ordered (salmon fettuccine, amatriciana, boscaiola) the salmon pasta was my favorite, but all three were very unique and good! The one thing that stuck out was I felt like the sauces were all a bit on the sweet side? I didn't mind it at all and they were delicious but it was something I noticed. No one else in my party felt this way though, so maybe it's just me.My dad ordered the fish dish and loved that. I had a bite and it was very fresh and tasty. My boyfriends pizza was just ok in my opinion, but the added burrata on top was delicious. Overall, I would definitely come back to try their other pasta dishes! Everything was fresh and delicious. Would also like to try the starters/desserts. Ambiance and service were all wonderful too.,Bottega is a must try in the Mission District. EVERY SINGLE SENSE WAS SATISFIED. The service, the ambiance, aesthetic, and food -- ALL ON POINT AND WE HAVE NO COMPLAINTS. This is a great place to come for a solo dolo dinner, girl night, date night, dinner or any occasion!Giovanni our server/host was one of the best I have ever encountered. He really went out of his way to ensure we were well taken care of and answered all our questions -- the true definition of customer service and being extremely personable. Food:- CRAB CAKES (paired nicely with the citrus and arugula)- WHITE TRUFFLE MUSHROOM PIZZA (amazing -- everything or anything truffle tastes good!)- BLACK TRUFFLE PORCINI RAVIOLI (ugh to die for -- mouth is seriously watering thinking about this)- BREAD (delicious and I asked for sides for marinara sauce and pesto to dip the bread because I am sauce girlllll)- BURRATA w/ Prosciutto and Tomatoes and Arugula  - BISTECCA DI MANZO (Cooked to perfection and flavorful) -- Giovanni choose the red wine to go with the steak and it was perfect!- Red Velvet (ONE OF THE BEST RED VELVETS I HAVE EVER HAD)- Limoncello Cake (Not really into lemon cake, but this was delicious -- I would get this again)- Lemon dessert wine (paired nicely with the desserts)EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING and we have no complaints and you must come here for yourself to see. This place seriously did not disappoint and Bottega has definitely made it to my top favorites restaurants in the city and I definitely will be coming back more often!,We really enjoyed the food here.  The fried calamari was excellent. Loved that it was mixed with other things.  The pizza was thin and crisp.  The pasta was cooked to perfection and it was actually one of my husband's favorite item that night.  He can't stop talking about it.  Definitely will have to have a revisit.,Can't say enough. Nick made our date night! We were sat at the bar on a busy Friday and were greeted immediately by his great professionalism. From beginning to end he was every engaging and made our 1st experience at this restaurant beyond memorable.The food!!! From cocktails to appetizers to main dishes... everything was beyond our expectations. Melt in your mouth flavors with the most traditional Italian Flavors!!! We will definitely be backDESERT was also unbelievable. The Panna Cotta was lights out! And the Chico moose cake was to die for!!We will be back!!!!!,My gf took me to this place. It was our first time there. The food was amazing. I had the Alfredo Fettuccine and italian sausage and my gf had the Gnocchi with pesto. We both shared the Bruschetta too. The Fettuccine was really creamy and the sauce was super rich. The Bruschetta was also really good. They really loaded it up and the fresh cracked black pepper was a nice little touch to the dish. The free bread was also really good. It was warm when they served it and it was airy and light; perfect to use with the remaining sauce from our dishes. The waiters and receptionist was also very nice and fast. Our server was super nice and was very friendly. You can tell the whole of staff cares about the food and the restaurant.The place was also very cute. It would be a really cool date spot for anyone looking to treat their partner out. The ceiling is decorated with flowers and beautiful lights. The place is very clean and well kept. This place definitely deserves a 5.,I tried the pizza and a pasta dish, and quite enjoyed both. The restaurant was pretty busy both inside and out, but we were able to get seated quickly at the bar. There seems to be a private room in the back? It seemed like there was a group gathering there.Love the busy atmosphere in the restaurant, and it was still quiet enough to have a conversation. I hope to be back!,Ok let's debunk the hype - is Bottega really worth it? I say YES. | v i b e |The ambience is something I noticed right away. It feels airy with the big windows, allowing for ample natural light. I love the touches of pink, hanging flowers, and brick wall! The interior is very European. The lights are dimmed when it gets dark out, giving off a casual romantic light. I will say that it's pretty loud inside because of the small space. | s e r v i c e |Every dining experience has been amazing! The waitresses always had great energy and were so friendly, answering all of our questions and offering  recommendations. My favorite is the GIANT black pepper grinder that they use when you ask for black pepper. | f o o d |First off, I LOVE THE PLATES!! It first starts off with free bread. It's been focaccia my past 2 visits so it's tempting not to load up on that. ~appetizers~- crocchette di verdure (6/5 - FAVE): essentially breaded, deep-fried veggie balls. Texture and flavor is amazing (especially paired with the truffle dipping sauce). - cavoletti di bruxelles (4/5): lightly fried brussel sprouts, served with a lemon wedge. The touch of lemon is divine!  ~pastas~ - mezzamaniche boscaiola (5/5): Very well-balanced pasta if you want something with meat and veggies as it comes with Italian sausage and mushrooms. ASK FOR THE PINK SAUCE!- spaghetti con le polpette (3.5/5): Meatballs didn't stand out to me, but the pasta texture was spot-on. - sacchetti (4/5): The sweet-creamy combo was a good break from a typical red or meat sauce. The pear and walnuts complimented the creamy cheeses. Add pancetta for a touch of saltiness! ~desserts~Seems like they have a rotating dessert menu but I could be wrong. I've had various versions of a panna cotta so far and they've always been a great end to our meals. *I recommend sharing everything family-style. Pastas are heavy so it's best to have variety.| t l ; d r |Come for the vibes, stay for the food! 10/10 would recommend and definitely will continue to come back hehe.,The hype is absolutely real!! I have nothing but good things to say about this place.  First off, everyone we interacted with had great lively presence and were so friendly. They were also nice enough to split our salad for us on separate place!! Such a nice touch. My bf and i both enjoyed our pastas but the pink sauce was definitely the winner. I highly recommend it. Also, the bread to start off your meal with is AMAZING. It was tough not filling up on that alone! Overall, one of my favorite places I tried recently. Cant wait to be back,While visiting the city, stumbled upon this place craving for some nice, wholesome food! Absolutely loved the ambiance, food and the service here! Slightly expensive if you try to build your own pasta but I guess that's due to SF city prices! Cute little spot, great for date nights!We ordered seasoned fries, bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon and Build your own pasta! Loved the food, since then we've been ordering from Bottega via DoorDash! Highly recommend and will be back here again!!,Had such a great experience here! My group of 20 and I were looking for a last minute place to eat for my friends birthday dinner and the hostess was so nice to accommodate such a fat group, and gave us a private deck area upstairs. It was decorated so nicely and the entire restaurant felt like a European/NY design. We ordered so many appetizers, pizzas and pastas that I didn't have an extreme favorite except remembering the starting bread and tartufo pizza being delicious.,Visited for dinner on a Saturday night. The place was quite busy and we waited for ~45 minutes to be seated. Our order:- whisper cocktail - very good- paradox cocktail - good- mushroom bruschetta - very good- sacchetti - good (it's good but too sweet)- eggplant parmigiana - goodOverall, we loved the service, ambiance and food. Will have to visit again to try out the other items on the menu. They are also very dog friendly. :),I've been wanting to try this place and finally got a chance to. This spot is so cute and great place for brunch and dinner. The pasta was so delicious and the sauce was super tasty. The pink sauce is a must try. Me and my friends shared and ordered the Salmon Fettuccine, Mezzeemaniche and Prosciutto pizza. One small thing I have to mention was the rigatoni was a little over al dente but besides that everything was super yummy. Highly recommend and will definitely come back.,One of the worst experiences I've ever had. If you're trying to book a reservation for a big group ,good luck because this has been nothing short of a nightmare. I called in about a month and a half ago trying to book a reservation for 10 people . I spoke to someone on the phone about booking the upstairs room for a set date. I thought everything was situated.When I called , they had told me someone else had already booked the upstairs room  & I was disappointed with their lack of communication . That was strike one .They rectified the situation and told me that they can go ahead and accommodate my party of 10 downstairs. I thought that was all confirmed but when I checked in a few weeks ago .. the person that was answering the phone seemed oblivious of that reservation . I was passed onto the manager that said he would go ahead and input our party down. The lady even took down my name and number , date & time of event. I thought that was all set . WRONG .I think I literally called the place 5 times to confirm my reservation and every single time everyone acts clueless . The last straw was when I called & same crap again with no reservation for my party. Total waste of time & energy . It shouldn't take this much time and effort to book a dinner. The people running this place needs to have better communication & honesty. I don't appreciate them wasting my time especially when I told them I can book at another place if they couldn't accommodate. It's literally a week away & hate that this place couldn't just tell me a month and half ago they wouldn't be about to accommodate my request. Also, I don't appreciate the misinformation about booking the upstairs room. Someone had quotes $50 per person minimum . Someone else quotes 1k minimum for booking upstairs . Idk why their pricing isn't consistent.So glad I don't need this added stress & was able to book somewhere else with ease ! Don't waste your time if you're looking to book for a big group.,Pretty restaurant - good cocktails, apps and food-  with east street parking on a Monday afternoon. We all enjoyed our dishes except for my Italian friend who felt that her gnocchi was not as soft as she likes. She did acknowledge that they were fresh made, but she didn't finish her dish. My amatriciana had a good kick, and the margherita pizza looked good. The service was their weak point; no one came by to check how we were doing, the pizza arrived long before the other main dishes, and the extra cheese request was ignored twice. Hopefully it was a one off situation. I'd like to go back and try some other dishes.,Wow wow wow. The food, the ambiance, the hospitality- such a good addition to Valencia. They were able to seat us upstairs which was the most intimate ambiance and decorative with flowers everywhere and wine bottles. Truly such a great aesthetic and good for us to celebrate our dear friend. Pasta was AMAZING. The gnocci in the pink sauce is so good, highly recommend it. We also accidentally got a dish with pork and my friend can't eat it so they were very kind to replace it with no charge. Service was great honestly felt very homey and attentive. It was a little harder to get their attention as we were upstairs but they came by frequently and we were able to request what we needed when they did. And my favorite thing  is the HUGE peppercorn grinder. Loved it.,Cute vibe and good service. I wanted the Carbonara but they were out. I got the Amatriciana, and unfortunately, it tasted a bit too burnt for me. Spaghetti texture was good though. My husband had the Spaghetti with meatballs and it wasn't super flavorful, unfortunately. Really wanted to like it - might come back to try more.,This place is great. It was my second time here and the ambiance is amazing. It's very pretty inside, and all of the staff is friendly. It was fairly busy but we got a table for 3 in 5 minutes on a Saturday night. The bread they serve at the beginning is my absolute favorite, often still warm. I got the special pasta that they offered. It had a tomato sauce, shrimp, olives and capers. It was fresh, a little too salty for me, but flavorful.  I've never had a bad dish here and it's always delicious.,The perfect date night/dinner spot on Valencia! The decor is stunning and lively at dinner time. The service is impeccable and my waitress was so sweet and attentive. There's free bread to start your meal - who doesn't love that? Espresso Martini - honestly the best I've ever had. Had the perfect balance of sweetness. Mozzarella in Carrozza - so good!! I had been craving mozzarella sticks and this was so savory and delicious. The tomato sauce was perfection. Mezzemaniche Bascaiola - simply perfect, it's like a hug in a bowl. The sauce has slight sweetness that works so well with the sausage and mushrooms. Our waitress mixed the sauce options for us and it was divine. Amatriciana - very tangy and savory, I loved it. If you're a fan of guanciale, this is a must. Salsiccia Pizza - crust had char and was so tasty. Definitely a great pizza. Limoncello Cake - light, lemony and decadent. Perfect ending to a carb heavy meal.,I've been wanting to go here so bad, so when my friend invited me to come - I just had to say yes (quickly!)Bottega is always full of customers and how can it not be? It's so cute inside and pink - my fav color!We ordered tons of food and a must ord",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
r for me is their minestrone soup - super flavorful and any of their pastas! Not only did the food taste good, the presentation was amazing!I will definitely come back here and order their pasta again!!,Really amazing pasta spot in San Francisco, probably my favorite! The service here is amazing, and it's a go-to spot for me when I am showing visitors around town. I joined the Yelp waitlist ahead of time, and getting seated was relatively easy once my whole party arrived. For pasta, I ordered the mezzemaniche, the mezzelune, and amatriciana. You can add a protein for a few dollars extra, and I really enjoy the Italian sausage! My favorite is the mezzelune since you can't go wrong with truffle and mushrooms, but you really can't go wrong with any of the pastas. They are the perfect texture. For drinks, I absolutely LOVED the paradoxe. Maybe one of my favorite drinks ever ordered. Would highly recommend dining here, and I will be back!,We were craving Italian food and finally decided to try out Bottega after reading the reviews. This place has beautiful indoor seating and a variety of pastas to choose from. They give you as much bread as you want to dip in olive oil. This could have been a bit warmer, but it's still good and definitely fills you up!Amatriciana ($22): Since this is a spaghetti dish and can be difficult to split, they were nice enough to offer to portion this out into 2 plates for us. The spaghetti noodle is thicker than what you buy in the grocery store and it was so good. The flavor of the sauce and texture of the spaghetti were spot on. Sacchetti ($21): I wanted to try this since it's pasta filled with cheese, pear, and walnuts. When you try the sauce alone, you think it's way too salty, but once you bite into the pasta and get the sweetness of the pear, it is a perfect combo. I loved the variety of textures and tastes in this one! Limoncello Drop ($13): Super strong drink -- you could really taste the gin in this and I thought it overpowered the limoncello. I liked the sugar ring around the glass though.Overall, super yummy pastas and I was really happy with our choices. We usually leave Italian places feeling like the pastas are way too salty, but the flavors were balanced here.,Some old friends were visiting from out of town and we wanted to have a nice sit down dinner together to catch up. I'll start by saying that Bottega most definitely has 5 star potential, but our food took about an hour to come out. There were two parties that were sat after us and paid and left before we got our food, so I think we just happened to have a one off experience.The ambiance here is top tier. The interior is nicely lit with modern Italian decor. For how nice the food and the restaurant itself looked, we were surprised to find entrees that were more than reasonably priced in the $20 range. The chicken parm was tasty and a generously sized portion! They have a great selection of wines and cocktails, as well as a massive pepper grinder that stands about 3ft tall haha. The staff was extremely kind and brought out a slice of cake and a song for my friend's birthday. Perfect spot for a date night or any excuse to celebrate.Be sure to join the waitlist through Yelp before coming in! There seems to normally be a consistent wait at least during dinner time. It saved us about 30 min. Come try this place out!,We hopped on their Yelp page to book our resy for 3. Bottega has become super popular and it's because the food is actually good and the aesthetics are ig worthy. We got seated on time and ordered drinks while browsing the rest of their menu. So many different options! Because this was our first time here, we asked the waitress for her recommendations. Indeed, we ordered all of her recs. Wild mushroom, smoked mozzarella and truffle oil bruschetta: 4/5Calamari fritti: 4/5Mezzemaniche boscaiola: 5/5Sacchetti: 4/5The waitress was kind and checked up on us often. Definitely want to give this spot another try next time and try some of the other stuff. So many options!,I discovered Bottega on social media and decided to give it a try. Stopped by on a Friday around 5pm and we were seated promptly. They are a walk-in only restaurant, so no reservations. I immediately noticed the great ambiance of the restaurant. I enjoyed how airy it was, along with the big open windows. My bf ordered the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola, but I didn't realize when I asked for the same dish. Our waiter suggested that they'll split that into two, and he'll surprise us with another dish... he said," """"If I trust him."""" Of course I had to! He surprised us with Sacchetti", and that was my first time trying it. We were satisfied with our food, it was so yummy. Loved the taste of everything. The plates were so cute. I also thought the prices were decent for pasta. Try not to eat too much bread as you're waiting for your food. ;),The steak is very rubbery and chewy, not edible. The customers next to our table returned the whole steak they ordered. Same with us, we and the customers next to our table got extra dessert instead of full refund of the steak.Pasta tastes great. Staff are friendly.Our server seemed to be distracted and keep forgetting our drink. She rarely checked our table, service was super slow.Ambiance was nice.,Went for LunchFood - 5/5. Bread had a good chew with a nice crust. Carrozza was delicious having a very crunchy skin and filled with gooey mozzarella. The tartufata pizza has a good bite on the dough and the toppings were flavorful with a nice texture. The truffle oil aroma was vibrant and added to the pizza overall, but the flavor was one that got tiring quickly. It was all very mellow and heavy in fat so your tongue got bored of it after a few bites. It could have used some spice or acid like a hot sauce or tomato sauce to liven it up. Spaghetti had perfect al dente bite to them with just the right thickness for a good chew. You can really taste that it was fresh pasta from the bitey texture and the tomato sauce achieved a mellow balance between sweet and sour. The meatballs were dense and savory but a little on the bland side. Great food!Service - 5/5. Highly energetic staff made the atmosphere lively and welcoming. Professional and timely service.Value - 5/5. Prices are fantastic with appetizers being in the low 10s and the pizza/pasta being in the high 10, low 20s. The portions are full size despite the generous prices and perhaps even bigger in some dishes when compared to other restaurants. Delicious food and great service at a good price. Perfect value!Parking - Street (Metered),My husband and I were looking a spot to eat in SF and when I looked at the reviews for this spot and I could not pass up the ambiance. My husband dropped me off to look for a parking spot, and I was greeted and seated immediately with multiple friendly employees.The on duty manager Antonio started cracking jokes and ended up being our waiter/server for the night which was amazing. He had so many recommendations for whatever appetite you came with. He was very passionate about his job and just had the best personality. He suggested two very different wines for us based off our palette. For food, to start, he recommended the Mozzarelle In Carrozza and basically told us we wouldn't want basic mozzarella cheese sticks again. And boyyy," was he right. He gave a few suggestions for dinner and my husband likes to play the question game of """"what do you like""""  with the waiter and typically picks what the waiter chooses. He got the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola and I taste tested to make sure it wasn't poisonous! Lol it was amazing and something I usually would pick for dinner but I chose the Mezzelune Ai Porcini based on this being a top choice from Antonio. It was equally amazing", just a different sauce and the truffle was sooooo good! The whole time we were there I couldn't stop looking around at all the decor. It was very photo friendly and the set up of the restaurant was just to die for! They also get more bonus points for the Halloween decorations!Right as we were going to ask for the check Antonio brought us some tiramisu! My husband thought I told him that we had just gotten married the prior weekend but I didn't! He surprised us with it and we told him that we had just gotten married and his other coworkers congratulated us too. Overall, it was a great experience and I can't wait to go back. ESPECIALLY BC I POSTED PICTURES ON IG AND EVERYONE ASKED ME WHERE THIS GEM WAS!,Finally got a chance to try this place and I was not disappointed! Came here on a rainy night for dinner and were sat immediately. We were given complementary bread that was out of this world delicious! I ordered the pesto gnocchi for my meal and it was so good. The pesto sauce was rich and creamy with flavor and the gnocchi was so soft like pillows! The overall ambiance of the restaurant is lovely! I will most definitely be coming back to try out other dishes.,I loved bottega!!! The restaurant itself is so beautiful and the waiters are so kind. They had a lot of options to choose from and the waiters made great recommendations to us. I've been here twice and it will definitely not be the last.,I came here with friends on a weeknight. This place was busy. There were tables available outside and they offered to give us a blanket to keep us warm. It was a nice night so we took advantage to sit outside. Banana cocktail - not too sweet and great for a warm weatherCaesar salad -= can't go wrongPizza - prosciutto pizza romana! the crust, great chew, cruncy and Mmmm just how I like my pizza. The fresh burrata yummm!Saccheti - I like to try something different and that can be risky. It's on a sweeter side, I would have made it spicy to balance out the sweetness. If you like the green salad with pears, gorgonzola and walnuts then you'll enjoy this. Great service! Great company! When can I come back? Hopefully soon!,If you're looking to carb load, look no further. The food at Bottega is absolutely stellar! We stopped by for a late lunch on Sunday and we were seated immediately at their window spot. Even though we were seated immediately, service took quite a while. It takes a while to flag down your waiter/waitress so make sure you know what you want so you can order everything at once!We ordered the gnocchi with truffle cream sauce and the salsiccia pizza to share. Both were made so well! The texture of the gnocchi was pillowy, chewy, and the sauce was super truffle-y. The salsiccia pizza was nice and crispy on the crust, fluffy in the middle, and topped with a bunch of sausage and onions. The pizza came with a side of Calabrian chili oil that both my fiance and I loved and we recommend asking for it if you don't get it. The plates looked small but they are incredibly filling.Overall we would definitely come back again if we weren't in a rush. It took a while to get bread, drinks, and then to order, to get our food, and then to pay. The food and the vibes were great and since we had the window seat, we really enjoyed watching all the dogs that passed by. Looking forward to trying out the spaghetti next time!,Attentive & friendly service, beautiful decor, and amazing pasta? I'm in! I loved everything about Bottega! The service was impeccable and soo attentive. The waiter always checked up on us and refilled our waters. The decor is rustic with hints of pink everywhere...love! I ordered the lasagna and it was seasoned perfectly. I'd love to be back when I'm in San Francisco to try other pasta dishes.,3.5 starsI was excited to try this place cause of all the hype. The service was excellent, our server was very friendly, gave us lots of recommendations and even accommodated adding vegetable toppings to our pasta dish, which was not an option on the menu. The ambience is also very fun, they do a great job celebrating birthdays and getting everyone at the restaurant to sing. Maybe it was an off night but our food took forever! We waited for close to 40 mins for our pasta. Ordered the mushroom ravioli and rigatoni with pink sauce - which was delicious. I'd skip the ravioli next time as it felt too rich for my liking. I really hope it was a one-off experience and will try it again just for the pink sauce pasta.,I've been to Bottega several times and each time I've been impressed. I went when it first opened and have been recently now that they've garnered a large audience. The decor is very aesthetic and it's popular, so make sure to join the waitlist or be prepared to wait.Despite their popularity, they've maintained their amazing customer service. The staff is always very attentive. They'll never let your drinks sit empty and even remember who ordered what when bringing out the food. I was once asked to move two tables down as they had to accommodate a big party. They gave us two free desserts and were very apologetic when they didn't need to be, which was a very nice gesture. This place is great for a date or a nice dinner with friends. My favorites are the Amatriciana pasta and truffle ravioli. The pasta is delicious, but the pizza isn't anything special. The dessert options are great though.All in all, I'd recommend Bottega for a nice dinner out.,I would give this place a 3.5 stars. The food is here great, but not outstanding, giving to the fact that there are a ton of great Italian places in SF. We ordered one appetizer and two pastas. My favorite was absolutely the appetizer and the pre-meal bread. Most places do calamari by its own, but this place mixes with eggplants, cucumbers, and potatoes. Even thought the portion is small, it is creative and delicious. Two pastas have great taste already, but again, so many different places can have this quality, like original joes. What I want to comment is the service here. They are kinda intense. They are very quick when you make an eye contact with them, but at the same time, they were joy that attentive. I felt they were on alert the whole time, maybe it's because the owner was there tonight? Who knows. Hope they will have a more relaxing working environment. But overall, we had a great time.,Lively, colorfully decorated place with high ceilings and tasty pasta. Groups of all sizes and all types of people come here to enjoy a meal. They have large tables in the middle and smaller tables at the sides. There's also a great people watching spot by the window. I like their calamari and their sausage pasta. You can choose the sauce, so I chose the pink sauce because the waiter recommended it. It was a good choice.Their pepper grater is very long, so they may not give you as much pepper. I'm guessing because it's difficult to use and heavy.,The website says they don't currently take reservations so my friend and I ended up waiting for around 45 mins for our table on a Saturday evening. I had been eyeing this place for a while since the interior is so cute so I was glad that I finally got to try it. I was plesantly surprised that we were offered the complimentary focaccia upon sitting down since most restaurants wait until you order (and even longer sometimes) before they serve you bread. The focaccia was light and airy. We shared the prosciutto pizza and mushroom ravioli - both were delicious. The ravioli serving size is on the smaller size but the overall portion size was perfect for us since the pizza was very filling. Definitely say yes to peper because they will come out with a giant pepper grinder. They also grate fresh parmesan cheese on your dish if you want. We also tried the tiramisu as well, which was just okay - the coffee flavor could have been stronger. Service is great too - our server was very nice and enthusiastic, and often checked in on us. They also refilled our bread without us asking for a refill which was nice. It also seems like a nice place for birthdays but be prepared to sit through a birthday song for a slice of complimentary cake haha!,"My friend and I saw a review on this place via Instagram. We really liked that we could put our name down on the waiting list via the Yelp app so that we didn't have to wait 1+hrs at the door. This place seemed very popular for birthdays. They do have outdoor seating but it was raining the night we went The host was pleasant. Our server was wonderful and had a beautiful accent. The bus boys were helpful in clearing the table when it needed to be cleared. Another staff member (possibly a manager) stated """"thank you so much for waiting."""" They took allergies into consideration and asked questions for more detailsThe food was literally on point and the best Italian food my friend and I have ever had. Drinks: we ordered the whisper and spicy margarita. Both were great Food: We ordered crab cakes", lobster ravioli and veal Marsala. Crab cakes were dollar coin size, made me sad they weren't bigger but they were delicious; not too fishy or mushy and the sauce was delicious. The lobster ravioli was amazing and cook aldente. The veal plate came with 4 pieces (I wish there more more mushrooms) and it wasn't as greasy as some other places. Desserts - lemon cake and panna cotta. Both were amazing and not too sweet Price - decent for San Francisco, I'd say average price for SF. Gender neutral bathrooms x2,Bottega, Bottega, Bottega! I don't know where to begin. I dined here last week with a couple of my gf's. Myself and and one of my friends have been wanting to try Bottega for a while since we've been seeing all the hype on social media. So we said, let's go! It'll be a fun dinner to catch up. We got on the Yelp waitlist. While we grabbed drinks before hand. We walked over to the restaurant and let the hostess know that we're checking in. We made reservations on the waitlist. She said, it doesn't matter you're on the waitlist or not. We have don't have any tables and people have not left yet. It might be 35 mins wait. Ok, what's the point of putting our names down on a Yelp wait list. When the waitlist says 15-20 mins. We thought that was rude. So we opted to wait anyway. Since we were hungry. As we waited, we got seated 20 mins later. They had to take some tables from the outdoor dining and into inside the restaurant. We started off with some drinks first and complementary bread. The bread was yummy. Nice and soft while dipped in Olive oil. We ordered our dishes and BOY!!! Did it take a while to come out. We waited 30 mins or more for. Our food. I shared a prosciutto pizza and mezzamaniche basicola pasta. I was disappointed with the food to be honest. It was missing something. Myself and my gf's couldn't pin point what it was lacking other than flavor. I could've made better pasta at home. Would I return for another dish to try? No, I don't think so. It's over hyped for me. They need to put some love into their food. Rather than having pricey pasta and pizza that didn't hit the spot. Oh, the server did apologize for the long wait time of our food and offered two free desserts on the house. That was nice.,What a delightful find while visiting my niece.  We were after a nice meal but running late. This was walking distance from her home and the service was OUTSTANDING, the food delicious and the ambience like being in someone's very nicely appointed backyard, homey and elegant.  The bruschetta funghi was so tasty and the gnocchi were like puffs of delicious magic with the black truffle cream sauce. Our server was wonderful on every level. Highly recommend it for a lovely evening!!!,Amazing amazing hospitality.I came here on a busy Saturday night with my partner and absolutely loved the food and vibe out here. In terms of recommendations for vegetarians," I'd try the """"Pizza Vegana"""" and the """"Gnocci""""", both of which were delicious and flavorful.Besides the food, we loved the hospitality of our servers as they checked in on us every few minutes despite having seated us at the bar. Given the huge amount of wait, I'd recommend adding yourself to the Yelp Waitlist ~30 minutes in advance if you're planning to be here on a weekend.,Very nice ambiance and they have a ton of seating options (table, bar, window, outside). We got two pastas. The truffle porcini ravioli and the sausage one. Both were okay. The ravioli was pretty oily and was just overly doused in truffle oil. The sausage one was decent! But some of the things tasted a bit like it was frozen for awhile.The unlimited bread is dope!,Had a great time at this new Italian spot in the Mission District. Came here for brunch with my cousins during the week. I can see this place busy over the weekend but I believe you can add yourself to the Yelp Waitlist. I love the ambience and aesthetics of this place. Very trendy and instagrammable. We got here right when they opened so duh, we were seated right away. The staff was super nice and friendly. Food Review:- Calamari Fritti 5/5 so good we ordered ankther - Funghi Bruschetta 4/5 interestingly good. - Sacchetti 5/5 soo goood! - Insalata Di Rucola 4/5 too much arugula - Prosciutto pizza 3/5 felt like it needed something sweet to balance the saltiness- Mezzemaniche Boscaiola 4/5 with red sauce good. However, the rigatoni was undercooked.- Tiramisu 5/5- Lemon cake 5/5- Panna Cora 4/5 not really a fan but it was decent I wouldn't mind coming back here again. The staff made it a pleasant experience for us and food is good.,Looking for fresh made pasta. Italian style, modern vibe. First off, you can tell when you are in the right place when the Olive oil is of good quality and the focaccia taste great.Parking: Street parking in the neighborhood. Make sure you read the restrictions for your stall.Service: Excellent! Antonio was attentive and provided great menu suggestions.What we ordered:Calamari Fried artichokes- Must try! Fettuccine AlfredoMezzemaniche BoscaiolaTiramisuTruffle risotto with sausage and mushrooms-which was the Daily Special. awesome choice as the Arborio rice was cooked to perfection. No shortcuts as you could tell the grains were perfectly heated to absorb the truffle taste.We will definitely return.Great menu selection and preparation and service makes you feel you are in Italy. I highly recommend you give this place a try.,Aright. Good Food vs Bad atmosphere & Inexperienced ServiceLovely place but LOUD HORRIBLE MUSIC!!! Just the worst. Who wants to have a relaxing Italian meal with screaming American R&B in the background & diners shouting over it. Just a flat out bad experience. I had to ask the server for everything--pepper, balsamic vinegar. They kept trying to take away plates before we were finished. Arggh. However the FOOD IS EXCELLENT!We would get it to go but never dine in again. However I will say when I told the server I hated the music she did change it. So that was cool.,"TL;DR - no wait on a Wednesday evening; great service from our Italian waiters; ambiance is lovely but a bit """"extra""""", food fell short but Brussels sprouts and mushroom ravioli were good We walked in on a Wednesday evening. We were greeted and seated immediately. The ambiance is warm and inviting; maybe a little feminine with all the faux flowers everywhere. The brick walls and ceiling make you feel like you're in Italy. They could do less with the decor though. For example, they were projecting videos of mountain landscapes on the red brick wall, so the images were hard to make out. The metal chairs look nice but aren't very comfy. The office lamps on the tables were odd.Service was great. They have some Italians working there with their thick Italian accents - it's a vibe. Unfortunately, the food fell short for me. - Cavoletti de Bruxelles (Brussels sprouts with pecorino Romano and citrus) was nice and tangy with the lemon on top: 4.8/5- Mezzelune Ai Porcini (ravioli stuffed with porcini mushrooms and black truffle cream) was great but a bit more truffle flavor would have been nice: 4/5- Margherita pizza was disappointing especially considering our waiter recommended it. It was on a flatbread. The sauce had very little flavor. We asked for chili pepper and they came back with mashed Calabrian chili which helped: 2/5- Chicken parmigiana was not good. The sauce had a strong flavor of tomato paste, and not much else. Chicken was a bit tough: 2/5Perhaps we just didn't order the best items, so I might come back and give it another chance.,Came here with a reservation at 530 on Friday, but my friends were about 30 minutes late so we were seated around 6 instead. The restaurant was not busy in the time I waited. The hostess was very friendly, allowed us to keep our reservation and to inform her when everyone was here. Update: It's seems like they are no longer taking reservations!We ordered:-Cavoletti di Bruxelle (5/5) nicely flavored with a good amount of crunchiness to the Brussels sprouts-Burrata Alla Caprese with add on prosciutto (3/5) it was okay - fresh and light, not much flavor. Quality of the burrata was lacking. Plus was the prosciutto. -Crab cake (5/5) me and my friends really enjoyed the crab cakes!-Mezzemaniche Boscaiola (4/5) flavor of the sauce was amazing!! The rigatoni itself was a little undercooked for my liking. Portion size was good!-Gnocchi with Pesto and add on chicken (4/5) the  gnocchi was soft yet chewy! The pesto sauce was decent but I've had better. Chicken breast chunks were big! Again portion size was good!The restaurant started getting busy around 645 and by 7 there were a lot of ppl waiting outside and inside the restaurant.Our waitress was super nice and made sure we were well taken care of throughout our dinner! Would come back again to tryout other foods on the menu,Bottega is such an aesthetic," yummy Italian place! Make sure to enter the waitlist way in advance during prime dinner times because it gets super busy.All of the food was delicious. The calamari was crispy and the aioli was super flavorful. The salmon fettuccine was creamy and had a nice salmon flavor that wasn't too fishy.My favorite dishes were the """"build your own"""" fettuccine with black truffle cream sauce with chicken that we ordered and the prosciutto burrata pizza. The pasta tasted very fresh and the sauce had a really nice savory flavor. The prosciutto burrata pizza was sooo good. The burrata was creamy and light and the prosciutto wasn't overwhelming. It came out hot and the crust was nice and crisp.I also ordered a drink- the Gossip. It was so pretty and also tasted really good!Once we were seated", our main dishes took about an hour to come out. I didn't mind personally because I wasn't starving coming in and we came in around 7-8:00 so it's understandable but it definitely was a bit of a wait. They also managed to get a table for a group of 8 of us at peak dinner hours so can't complain :),Food was delicious! Ambiance was eclectic! Service was great! I highly recommend this place,Came here around 2 pm on a weekday, so the place was pretty empty. I saw that other yelpers had to wait or even sign up for the waitlist, so pro tip: come on a weekday if you can. The restaurant itself is very beautiful. I like the open air concept and the fact that you can choose to sit inside or outside. Complimentary focaccia/bread which I found a bit bland so I didn't end up eating much of it. I ended up ordering the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with tomato sauce. Comes with these delicious meatball like things, only they are flatter and more tender. Excellent flavor on the meatball and tomato sauce. Not too heavy. The pasta itself is definitely hand made, so keep in mind that it's a bit harder than Al dente. The serving size was pretty decent and the quality was good especially for the price. $21 dollars might seem pricey for pasta, but the homemade quality of the food justifies it. I was able to finish the entire plate.,Celebrated a bday @ bottega in the mission & it was so good!! They have a solid pasta selection plus you can build your own so we chose fettuccine + black truffle cream sauce + guanciale + spinach. we also got the prosciutto pizza which had artichokes & burrata! My friend asked for chilis on the side which I highly recommend cuz they were delicious and the spice made everything better. even the free bread they give you was fire I couldn't stop eating it and I took all the extras home lolWalked to Arcana after for some wine--it was pretty crowded but a really cool place. 5 stars all around! Woohoo!,Ambiance, food, customer service, drinks. Well my second Gossip cocktail ended up being over killed by the Prosecco but I sent it back and they fixed it. Excellent service by the gentleman named Stephano? I think I got his name wrong. Food is super delish...I love it here. I'm coming back for sure.,A group of us visited this place on a Saturday evening. They are extremely busy and we had to wait outside in the cold for about 30 minutes. Once we are seated, true service was good. The ambiance is great. Many birthday parties. We heard happy birthday at least five times during dinner. Food is delicious. We are pleased with the overall experience. Will come back for sure.,Solid Italian food in an aesthetic, trendy, hip space. First of all, DEFINITELY use the Yelp waitlist if you plan on coming! A group of me and three others decided to come her last minute and signed up for the waitlist (which was ~5 min). When we got there, they were ready to seat us, while others were turned away saying there was a 30 minute wait!HUGE PRO: there is unlimited bread refills and they do an amazing job of refilling the baskets! which to me, is a sign of quality service.Onto the food, we ordered two pastas and a pizza split between four and it was the perfect amount. 3/5, Salmon Fettucine: The salmon fettuccine had a very alla vodka-tasting creamy sauce which I enjoyed. However, there was so few salmon bites, it was a little disappointing.3.5/5, Prosciutto Barrera Pizza: you literally can never go wrong with a prosciutto pizza! Delicious and the cheese is to die for.We ordered a glass of wine for the table as well and it was perfect for the food + vibe. They leave one of the walls open, so would highly recommend coming here on a nice day with a small group of friends or for a date :) would definitely come again simply because of the high quality service and ensured good time!,This place is s gem!It feels cozy with those lamps and the brick wall.The flowers and the overall decor is SO pretty.Very clean and the service was attentive/good. Drinks: 10/10I had the Limoncello drop and Aperol Spritz. Both really good and well presented.Food: 10/10Complementary focaccia.-Burrata salad. Not the best I had but it was good!-Bruschetta ai funghi. Very tasty. Generous portion. -Carciofi. Well seasoned and the sauce was very good. Loved this one! I only wish the bar had a hanger for the bags. If they do I didn't see it.------------Such a lovely experience. I will comeback for sure!,I got the salmon fettuccine and crab cakes. Sometimes I'm a little hesitant about fresh pasta because the texture isn't as firm or has that bite that I want from it. The fettuccine was pretty good! There are big chunks of salmon in there cooked perfectly. Their signature crab cakes were delicious but so so small! Bottega gets extremely busy and they don't take reservations. You should get on the waitlist on Yelp in advance and no groups larger than 3-4 or else you may have to wait longer for a table. The bar seating is usually available but to get a table may take a while. The decor inside is really nice and instagrammable. Young owners and chefs that are friendly and always check in on you to see how you're doing. They aren't pushy and don't try to make you order a lot, just whatever you feel like eating.,One of my favorite meals that I've had in a while! Bottega has been on my to-try list for a while now ever since I saw photos of their cute decor. We finally had the chance to stop by last weekend and not only was the decor just as cute in person, but the food was amazing. Seriously, I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order. Another reason that we were drawn to Bottega is because you can customize your own pasta! You can either build your own or some of the pasta dishes let you choose your preferred sauce. The food came out in courses and our utensils and plates were swapped after each course, which definitely made this restaurant feel a little higher end. We also appreciated how attentive our server was. At one point, our server saw my boyfriend putting additional black pepper from the table onto his pasta and he was over a few seconds offering freshly grated black pepper instead. We ordered the Calamari Fritti, Prosciutto e Burrata Pizza, Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with cream sauce, and Spaghetti ala Gricia. The proscuitto pizza was absolutely amazing paired with the hot sauce on the side and chili flakes. The pasta was al dente and prepared to perfection. I think the rigatoni was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. I can't wait to come back to try some of their other pizzas and pastas. I see some reviewers commenting that the portion sizes are small but for me, it was the perfect amount since we wanted to try and share multiple dishes. The only thing I noted is that we weren't given a dessert menu and was just given the check. We weren't planning on ordering anything anyway because we were so stuffed, but we did see other tables with desserts. Either way, that didn't take away from the service or the food so it's still 5 stars from me!,Just checked my credit card bill and they charged me around $83 when it should've been $74 (tip inclusive). I disputed with my cc company and will update when I hear back from them.Update: refunded promptly, thank you Matteo.,I had dinner here last night and it was such a great experience overall! The vibe/music/theme of the restaurant make for a relaxing and enjoyable meal. I had a glass of champagne that was great, and the food was amazing. I ordered the fettuccini alfredo with chicken, and it was a nice sized portion with lots of flavor. The complimentary bread was a nice touch, and also delicious. The highlight of my dinner was definitely the enormous pepper mill, which our waitress let me try out on my pasta! This was such a spectacle and it put a big smile on my face :)Can't recommend this place enough!,lively environment and the prosciutto pizza was to die for!!! Love that they also had a cocktail list as most Italian restaurants only have a solid wine menu. Would recommend for groups or a fun date. The staff offers to split dishes in case you don't want an entire pasta dish for yourself. Favorite spot to carb load.,My party of 3 waited for about 15 minutes on a busy evening - shorter than we expected after seeing the large groups. We shared the Burrata, Mezzelune ai Porcini, and Mezzemaniche Boscaiola. The burrata was pretty good, it tasted very fresh and flavors paired well together. The mezzelune ai porcini was the winner of the night! It was our favorite dish because it was so creamy and flavorful. I dipped the complimentary bread in the leftover black truffle cream sauce and it was -chef's kiss-. Unfortunately, the mezzemaniche boscaiola did not impress us one bit. Pasta was overcooked, peas tasted frozen, and dish overall tasted like airplane food :( But the other 2 dishes made up for it and our waiter was friendly too.,One tool that I utilized was the jump in line through the Yelp app. I left Richmond and got in line by just logging in a little bit of information. By the time I got there ,they were ready to seat me. Very convenient because this place is busy. Upon entering the very first thing I noticed was the nice bar and the ambience was NICE, the friendly service. This place was excellent and the food was outstanding. I had the lobster ravioli some coworkers had some specialty stuff that was recommended for the evening. Plus the desserts and the craft drinks... wow! This is a must go. Regardless, if you live in the San Francisco Bay area or if you're just visiting. You will not be disappointed.,Super cute & social spot! If you're going on a Saturday, be prepared for a wait, but it's super easy to put yourself on the waitlist ahead of time on yelp. The food and atmosphere is worth the wait. I took my cousin who was visiting from out of town with some friends & everyone loved their meals. We started off with bread & the calamari. The portions don't seem huge but they are filling & delicious. I got the gossip cocktail which tastes like a mimosa & for my entree I got the amatricanna with meatballs. The sauce and meatballs were bomb. Would def come here again!,BOTTEGA, you're beautiful. The space, the food, the staff and the aperol spritz is amazing. I just got back from Italy and all I been craving is more pasta, pizza and aperol spritz.  Everything my friend and I order was delicious. Lets start by saying the interior decor is beautiful.  Just a pretty spot for any occasion.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating.  Week nights are not much of a wait but if you go on the weekend, expect to wait. No reservations.  After you order, they will give you fresh focaccia bread, yum!  My friend and I ordered the Carbonara. When I saw carbonara on the menu, I assumed its spagetti only because that's all they had in Italy.  Bottega's carbonara is made with Rigatoni.  Don't get me wrong, it was creamy and delicious but when expect something and got something different, throws me off a little.  Ha! totally my fault.  It was really good that I would order it again.  Also got the special of the day, which was the Truffle Risotto.  So good, perfect texture and not too rich but just enough.  We also got the Prosciutto Pizza.  This pizza is a dream, I can eat this one everyday.  It's made with Fior di latte, prosciutto san daniele, fresh artichokes and burrata.  Burrata on pizza are the best. I came here to celebrate my friends birthday and they gave her a slice of red velvet cake.  The staff was super nice too.  If you like pepper, make sure you ask for some fresh pepper, you will get a little surprise.,So SO good and super cute inside!  Bottega is the perfect spot for a girls dinner or date night!  All the food we tried was delicious, AND the decor is super cute (always a plus)!My friend and I ordered aperol spritzes to start, and we sipped on those while munching on the free focaccia bread with olive oil.  Yum yum!  We ordered to share:- Prosciutto & burrata pizza: I loved the crust on this! The artichokes were unexpected but delicious too.- Truffle sausage risotto (a special the day we went): My fav dish of the night--I love truffle anything and this was great. The truffle flavor was pretty strong and the risotto was cooked perfectly.  I also liked the mushrooms in it.- Carbonara: They use rigatoni instead of the usual spaghetti but it made it easier to eat imo! A little on the saltier side but that's probably from the bacon + cheeese. Still yummy though.Service was super friendly. I'd definitely come back again!,Dine In during Covid 19Overall: 8/10I can't remember how many times I had their take away since this is my go to restaurant whenever I don't know what to eat. They must have love food soo much to create all these delicious dishes! I originally attracted by their pastas but their pizza are even better!Quattro Formaggi Pizza: 8/10This is literally the first four cheese pizza that I like. Try it!Prosciutto e Burrata Pizza: 8/10Wow this pizza is amazing! I have never had pizza with cream like mozzarella cheese on top, this pizza  definitely broaden my food experience! Mezzemaniche Boscaiola in Pink sauce: 8/10Sooo good! Lasagna: 8/10I always come here when I craved for some bolognese sauce pastas. This is it. Bolognese pasta should taste like this everywhere!Insalata Di Rucola: 8/10A simply fresh arugula salad with some good cheese. Chocolate dessert: 8/10I had it a long time ago through take out and not sure if they still have it. This chocolate cake is better than a lot of the dessert places! Try it if you see it!Sacchetti: 7.5/10Mozzarella in Carrozza: 7.5/10Panna Cotta: 7.5/10Tiramisu: 7/10Hmm the particular tiramisu I had was not too great...Considering how good the other food are, maybe I should give it another try?,There were a few hiccups, but we enjoyed our visit. This place felt super upbeat with the noise level/music and lots of employees walking around. They apparently opened only 3 months ago.We got the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola and a build your own pasta with penne, black truffle cream sauce, Italian sausage, and mushroom. They also asked if we'd like more bread before our pasta was served, which we said yes to, but it never came. I liked the bread, which was soft but not warm at all.The Mezzemaniche Boscaiola was really good and came with peas, which aren't listed under this item on the menu so not sure if that was a mistake. The pasta felt a little under Al dente, but I didn't mind.The penne in the build your own pasta was way overcooked and super soft, but we really liked the black truffle cream sauce. They also forgot to add the Italian sausage and took about 15 min to bring it in a separate dish after we pointed it out.When we asked for the check, our server accidentally gave us wrong bill. There were several mistakes throughout, but they're newly opened and definitely seem to have a lot of potential to be even better. I'd like to come back again, and hopefully all the pasta will be nicely cooked and we'll get everything we order by then.,The food here is so so yummy and the bread they bring out to you is awesome. Drinks were also very good. The decor is... interesting! There were so many cheesy elements that it actually kind of worked?? I was pretty into it. And it seemed everyone who worked there was actually Italian which was pretty cool. Go give it a try!! I do not think you'll be disappointed at all.,Inside: Light pink background lights with ivy plant design on the ceiling and walls. Funky and hype. Definitely an insta spot. Food:. Starter bread was soft and fluffy, which was great with the starter salad (Burrata Capresse). Wanted a second round of bread,LOL. Pasta was awesome! Fresh pasta can never be disappointing. Sauces were dense, full of tomato flavor; not greesy or artificial tasteful. Wait time: Visited without reservation on a monday dinner time. 5-10min wait and we were in!,They don't take reservations, but gladly you can join the yelp waitlist. We got lucky for a Friday night to only wait about 25 minutes. First off, the inside is very cute. Great ambience! We ordered 2 alcoholic beverages that were great. We ordered fettuccine with chicken. Unfortunately the dish had no salt and barely any flavor. The pasta was stuck together too, seems like when they made it they didn't add flour to stop the sticking. My friend is vegetarian so created her own pasta dish. She appreciated having vegetarian options. She created her own dish with a creamy pasta. So similar to my dish, not much flavor. We didn't have one server, it was multiple servers. We would get asked 3 different times what drinks we wanted. Then when it came to get the check we had to wait around for about 20 minutes. The service wasn't the greatest. Overall the aesthetics are very cute.,Heard great things about this place and decided to go here for lunch. The food did not disappoint. Funghi Bruschetta (not pictured): They forgot that we ordered this and left it at the counter because we got it at the end of the meal and it was cold. Not a big deal since we didn't eat it there but once air fried up at the home, it was super crispy and flavorful. 4.5/5Tartufata Pizza: The sauce on this was amazing and the mushrooms complimented the sauce so well. Each bite was super creamy and flavorful but not too creamy where youre worried about your next bite. My only criticism would be that the pizza towards the center was a little soggy from the sauce compared to the edges. 4.5/5Mezzamaniche Boscaiola: We got this with the cream sauce and added prosciutto. Be warned the prosciutto is not what you're traditionally used to and resembles crispy pork belly. The sausage had good flavor to it but the overall dish was unimpressive to me. Very standard cream sauce and the rigatoni was too al dente for me. 3/5Also interesting but they don't give you a cocktail menu off the bat so make sure to request one. Italian Espresso: Very strong and not much coffee flavor. Straight liquor. I was expecting an espresso martini kind of drink but it was very strong liquor flavor to it. 3/5Banana cocktail (forgot the name): The banana flavor was subtle and mainly had an alcohol taste. Wish there was a little more banana flavor but it was a smooth cocktail. 3.5/5Would recommend and I see myself coming back to try their other dishes.,First off, they allow your pup indoors!! Love this, esp for a cooler night in SF. The food was good, but I think the ravioli was sickening with too much truffle oil. The calamari was a standout, crispy but not oily! The drinks were just okay. Their version of a lemon drop and espresso martini were strong but do not expect a craft cocktail. The price point for this restaurant was fair for the quality of food.,What a great place to grab lunch/dinner with your friends!The servers are friendly. It adds that extra pizazz when they come by to offer freshly grated parmigiana and black pepper from a giant pepper mill. 10000% Instagram story friendly lol.The food was also very good and the portions were nice. I don't usually like my veggies but the Brussels sprouts were a hit! Plates were also shareable.,Three of us gals ordered the salmon fettuccine, truffle pizza, and Mezzemaniche Boscaiola. Of the three, I enjoyed the salmon fettuccine the most. The salmon was the star of the dish. It was cooked to tenderness. The truffle pizza was not great. It tasted charred/burnt and hardly had any flavor to it. Not a fan at all. The Mezzemaniche Boscaiola was okay. A bit to al dente. The sauce was decent. I was expecting it to be more rich. The interior of this restaurant is super cute!! Love how they have giant pepper grinders lol.,Came here at about 630 and thought we would have to wait because the online waitlist said 50+minutes, but when we checked in 10 mins later, they were able to seat us immediately outside (albeit there were no heat lamps when we went, so dress warmly if it's cold). Cocktails were food. We shared the crab cakes, which were okay (although coming from Maryland, it's hard not to compare these little guys with the giant lump crabcakes, which I prefer). We then shared two pastaa- the mushroom ravioli (mzzelune) and the sacchetti (pasta with cheese, pear and walnuts). Both were fine; the wait staff very kindly split the plates for us, which is always appreciated. Overall we thought this place was good but not better than barzotto down the road, which seems to generally have a shorter wait time. Still, if you can snag a spot, worth checking out.,I am dairy and gluten free... so why would I be posting a 5 star review? Well, it's because Bottega has gluten free pasta. Usually, gluten free pasta will either fall apart or clump together but Bottega's gluten free pasta did not disappoint! I've been to Bottega twice now. I did the build your own both times to allow freedom from the usual restrictions I have at Italian places. I usually love pungent cheeses and the gorgonzola hit the spot a little too well. Opting for the pink sauce the second time, I felt that it was much more balanced. Both sauces contain dairy, so I just took lactaid and everything was fine. I added on the sausage and it was plentiful. Note: ask for black pepper and they will bring out a HUGE peppercorn grinder.,Wow. Exceptional experience! Definitely a new favorite in the city. Came with friends for my birthday dinner - the staff, decor and food could not have been more delightful. Pasta was the freshest I've ever had in the city and packs a great punch in flavor. Appetizers were fantastic as well and as a bonus they source their olive oil from Italy Alecio was our server and had a great sense of humor and handled our ridiculousness with grace :)My only feedback is that the pizza was probably my least favorite item. I expected it to be thin crust just out of the oven but it was more like a deep dish cornmeal crust. Very strange for Italian in my opinion but others enjoyed it a lot. They have a limited cocktail menu (not in print) and are mostly beer and wine. Will definitely return!,One of my favorite Italian places. Great ambiance, decor, service and food. There's a yelp waitlist which gets from a 5-10 minutes wait to 70-90 minutes wait within the hours of 6-8 PM. For customers waiting for a longer time, they let you order drinks as you wait outside. The outdoor dining isn't as great as indoor atleast for dinner; it's a public seating area with no tent / heating. Once seated, we were welcomed with warm spongy bread and olive oil and given the choice of sparking, still, and tap water. For apps, we went with the mozzarella sticks which were crispy and not too oily and perfectly filling for a an appetizer. As for the entrees, the chicken parmigiana was unlike the usual thin long noodles came with Rigatoni pasta.My favorite entree/order was the Truffata pizza. I only like white sauce pizzas and this was one of the best sauces I've had. They were generous with the mushrooms and they were cooked to the perfect texture. The pizza was just the perfect combination of toppings. Lastly," the wine menu was expansive and fairly priced to complement the Italian fare. Can't wait to eat here again!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fog Harbor Fish House,"All menus are taste perfect and look goodLuis also sooo kindi would like to visit again,A- mazing. I had the Shellfish Platter for one and it was loaded! I definitely ate everything but half of a portion of the linguine. Wow. I'm like super impressed. George was a Greater waiter. Serve and meal was excellent.,We are from So Cal and coming here to dine was a great experience. Luis was our server for the evening and presented everything perfectly. The food was fresh and the view was perfect with a great ambiance. We are looking forward to our next trip again.,My fiancé took me to San Francisco for a mini vacation and we took a walk down the pier after dinner where he asked me to marry him! Woo!Anyway, enough about me and more about Fog Harbor! It is in the pricier side but the view is amazing and the staff were attentive in the right amount. We got seated right at our reservation time and within 5 minutes of ordering drinks we were ordering dinner. Very efficient service.We got the whole crab with was boiled in garlic and butter as well as the seafood pasta which had mussels, shrimp, and some crab legs. It was all extremely fresh and delicious! Definitely make sure you have a reservation or you will wait to be seated. It's a pretty popular spot. I would always opt for the whole crab cause you get more meat.Definitely a place to try!,We ordered the garlic Dungeness crab. It came with green beans and fingerling potatoes. The crab, beans and potatoes were cooked well but the garlic was burnt and bitter.The service was very good.We enjoyed the view of Alcatraz from our window seats but restaurant is a bit noisy.,We went here on a Friday night, party of 4, and had made a reservation a couple weeks in advance.We ordered a bunch of food but my favorite was the calamari, clam linguine, and garlic roastedDungeness crab.Overall I was expecting this place to be touristy with mediocre food, but I can assure you that I was wrong and the food and service was fantastic! If you are lucky you might also be able to grab a spot by a window with amazing views. I will definitely go back to this spot.,A corporate dinner at FH2, one of the premier restaurants on Pier 39, was spectacular.I wasn't facing the bay so my view was impaired, and there was too much glare to see out the window anyway.  I'm sure it's nice.There is bar seating but we went directly to our tables. And the restaurant had set up two tables for our party.We ordered 2 dozen oysters about 4-5pp with a couple of the crab cakes, a cup of chowder, and an order of Ciopino - red sauce with a bunch of fish bits without the pasta. To wash it all down I had an hazy IPA from San Leandro, not my fave, not hazy enough, and a 2019 CabSav My Friendly Neighbor from San Luis Obispo, which was very smooth.Excellent service and company.This all came after a 2 hour scavenger hunt on the Let's Roam app.,DISAPPOINTED!!! Had a reservation for this afternoon. We checked in at the entrance and were seated within 20 minutes. The restaurant was busy. Our server seemed tried and not interested at all. Good ambiance, nice view to ocean and pier. Food : We ordered Crab Cakes, Garlic Roasted Crab and Lobster Tails, very mediocre. The lobster lacked any taste, crab seemed to be old, it was such a pain to remove the meat, the crab lacked any flavor of its own, it was just drizzled with heaps of garlic butter. If you want to enjoy crab, you can easily order two plates of crab cakes rather than ordering whole crab. There was nothing seafood about it, the taste was blah.,Rules to live by: Most restaurants near the water--in any city--are terrible.  Most restaurants on Pier 39 are terrible.Fog Harbor, which is on Pier 39, and on the water, is a very pleasant exception to these rules.The clam chowder is very good. The fresh bread is excellent.  The lobster roll was very disappointing.  There wasn't much lobster and what lobster was there was mostly minced-up meat.  It costs a brutal $33.  A much better entree is the ahi tuna poke.  It's a solid, very attractive dish.The drinks are good but don't sleep on the mocktails.  The non-alcoholic Blackberry Press was absolutely delicious.Almost all of the tables have great views.  Use the Yelp waitlist to avoid lengthy waits.This is a solid restaurant lost in a sea of Bubba Gumps.,My family stumbled upon this restaurant after eating at Franciscan's and liked this restaurant so much better! This restaurant is right at the start of the pier 39 boardwalk. The crab, lobster, and oyster were a lot more fresh and the environment is also nicer. Highly recommend! Our waitress was named Shakura and she was AMAZING! I couldn't have asked for better service. She recommended good dishes and was on top of checking in on us. She made our dining experience even better. :)Dishes: - shellfish platter (for 1) w lobster tail: 9/10, comes with garlic noodles and an assortment of seafood - garlic Dungeness crab: 8/10, same flavor as the shellfish platter - crab stuffed lobster: 6/10, had a fishy taste and was very underwhelming, do not recommend this special,Everything here is soooo good! Located on pier 39 on the 2nd floor. During lunch time, they are separated from eagles Cafe but during dinner, they combined and become 1 restaurant. Pretty unique.Their bathroom even have someone to open the door and pull out napkins for you to dry your hands.Super fancy!Must try their rissotto and bruschetta!,We loved our special night with Fog Harbor and our waiter Bong Jovi (cool name). Highly recommend the seafood here - it's a true experience. Whole roasted crab - people love the ceremonial bib service. They are so considerate, they even ask about whether you want the crab facing you or away. The Korean influencers next table filmed their entire meal. Gotta take friends out of town here. They will have a blast. Especially international friends. crab house is quite an experience.The crab could be even more fresh and tender. But I feel that's what all crabs taste like around the Bay Area now. We requested extra melted butter to keep it tender. It helped!Famous clam chowder by the cup. There's so much food to consume and it is heavy. Unless you have a big family I highly recommend you get the cup first. It's creamy and great.Caesar romaine salad: exactly what you expect a good classical flavorful salad to be.Linguini clam pasta seems so simple but this one of the few places that does it well. It's delicious and affordable highly recommend it. It's my favorite.Prosecco and Gloria from Carneros by the glass is affordable $10-$15,Fog Harbor feels like the kind of place you visit for the overall ambiance and views since it's perched right on pier 39. The food was good though a bit pricey in my opinion, but still a solid place to visit especially for tourists!My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary dinner a few weeks back with a reservation, so we were seated immediately with no problems. This place definitely gets busy so would recommend reservations if you don't want to wait!We started out with the baked oysters which were super flavorful and definitely a good appetizer to begin with. Then I had the seared scallop & crab risotto and my boyfriend had the cioppino. The crab risotto was packed with crab meat which I loved, and the scallops were good but a little bland. My boyfriend did enjoy the cioppino which was chock-full with seafood in a tasty tomato broth that was perfect on a cold SF evening. For dessert, we split the apple crisp a la mode which I would highly recommend if you love warm apple desserts :),Our family ate at Fog Harbor on a family trip to San Fran. It was packed when we visited but the wait was not long. Service and decor were ok. Their clam chowder/ Caesar salad lunch combo were a good deal and proportioned appropriately. My kids loved the fish and chips although it was a little pricey. The best experience was the sourdough bread. It is San Francisco, after all!,Located at a tourist area made this place really popular so get there early to make sure you don't have to wait for a long time. Food wasn't that impressive. Cioppino had too much tomato taste. Mixed grill was nice as well as mashed potato that came with it. Linguine and clams was ok while clam chowder was served with a lot of clam which was nice and oyster was fresh and its sauce was tasty.We ordered a bottle of wine which tasted nice and not too dry. One interesting thing though, when I first got there it seemed to me that this place try to be fancy by the way of the table setting and how staffs dressed but the way our server poured wine was not the right manner....... But that didn't bother me since I enjoyed the time with my friends and service was nice. Just to point that outSunset in the evening made this place so beautiful. Don't forget to validate your parking ticket!! I got $10off .,We came here at a time that patrons were being asked to show their proof of COVID-19 vaccination cards for dining in. You could always select to use their outdoor dining to not have to show a card.There was a line of people waiting to get inside. Each person ONLY had to show their CDC proof of vaccine card to get in. When our turn came we showed our cards and the folks at the door asked for a PHOTO ID as well. We showed it, but mentally noted that NOT ONE PERSON AHEAD OF US WAS ASKED TO SHOW THEIR ID.I didn't want to make a big deal of it because I was hungry and wanted to order.The restaurant was not full at all when we first arrived. We chose to sit in the back where the windows were opened and a breeze was blowing.Jim was our server. We placed our order of clam chowder, etc.Our food ended up being just okay. Because we've been here many times and the food and service was good we will look to return in the neat future.,My family and I went to SF to celebrate our wedding anniversary and picked Fog Harbor Fish House for our celebration dinner. We weren't sure what to expect but hoped for some tasty eats. Our booking for the reservation was done online with a request for window seating as available.They delivered on the seating and we had a nice window view which we enjoyed.On to the food... this was not what we expected, it was beyond our expectations. Our son ordered their lobster roll that was gone as quickly as it was brought to the table, and our daughter went with  their burger that was almost as big as her, she enjoyed it as well.I went with the shellfish platter which was plentiful and prepared very well, savory and fulfilling. My wife had the Garlic Roasted Whole Dungeness Crab that looked beautiful. The potatoes that came along with her dish were epic. Our entire experience there was exceptional. We will make it back to the Fog Harbor Fish House every time we are back in SF!,Went to this spot for our anniversary and really enjoyed it! The food is amazing, I can really recommend the bruschetta, lobster roll and the clam chowder! The BlackBerry Mock tail was really good as well! Our server Arif was amazing! Really kind person and great service!,After all these years visiting Pier 39, I've never eaten at Fog Harbor Fish House. The idea popped in my mind when my daughter said I want Oysters for her Birthday. Luckily they were able to take us in without reservations. I might say service was superb and food was excellent.  I'm not going into details regarding each item we ordered but no complaints from me. It's comforting when you see your child smile and enjoy the food.It was a great 21st Birthday,This place was located at the beginner of the Wharf. Such a cute place with a very nice view. We purposely went here for the clam chowder and the cioppino, which did not dissapoint. Their clam chowder had a thick creamy texture, adding crab meat suggested by our server made it waaay better.The cioppino was also good and so meaty, had right amount of fish and other seafood.We also got ahi tuna with avocado, it was good but the chowder was the star of the night for me.The alcatraz drink was good, it had pineapple and three different kind of rum. Its good but a little too strong.For dessert we had apple crisp with vanilla icecream on top. Great way to end dinner. Love the chowder though, I would come back just for that.,This was one of the top places I've ever eaten. I travel to sfo for business and always try a new place when I'm out here. Fog harbor has taken the cake. I was a few minutes late as I didn't realize the entrance was only accessible by going up stairs so I ran around the first floor of the pier for some time trying to figure out how to get in. Go up the stairs and it's quite simple from there. I was seated right away with a stunning view of the pier. I was able to watch the sea lions swim and jump and it was incredible. My waiter made great wine recommendations and the scallops were perfectly cooked. I can't wait to visit again,Amazing meal with fantastic views! We also had the best server, Bongjovi little did he know we were from NJ!,Yummy oysters and even yummier drinks! Quick stop at the bar to enjoy this awesomeness,We made a reservation after reviewing their special menu for restaurant week. I'll admit it was a little bit confusing, because we had to ask for the restaurant week menu AND the entrees were slightly different from what was being advertised on the website. Slightly bummed, but I didn't really care unless it tasted delicious. (They did also update their menu on the website after our visit.)The appetizers were delicious, we got oysters & calamari. The oysters were fresh, and I loved that the calamari also included fried onions and jalapeños! The calamari was also a really big serving (: The creme brulee was also good.The entrees were just okay. I got the shellfish platter which I read beforehand came with fingerling potatoes, but was later changed to garlic noodles. The noodles were a little too al dente & the seafood was overcooked. My partner got the steak which we thought would come with shrimp and crispy rice. They were able to add the shrimp but no rice. He also thought the sauce needed to be cooked more.Service was amazing though!,Stopped in here (with a reservation of course) on Sunday afternoon with 2 friends from out of town!I wanted to take them somewhere with a nice ambiance to enjoy seafood -- this spot has raving reviews and is located in the heart of pier 39. We were seated within 5 or so minutes of arriving and I found the staff to be really kind.All 3 of us for clam chowder bread bowls and these are a steal given the nice restaurant! The total per bowl was $12 -- can't beat it! The clam chowder was hot, tasty, and perfect for the overcast weather that day!I will definitely return here in the future whenever I am craving clam chowder. Great service, great food, great ambiance!,Celebrated my sons 16th birthday with family. Food is delicious; we had several dishes; and they all were divine. Amazing pasta dishes; top tier seafood. The drinks are top shelf; we had several. The kids had a good variety to choose from. Highly recommended for the entire family.,Fog Harbor is at Pier 39 and while, as would be expected offers a wide selection of fresh seafood, it has an many non seafood offerings.  It's waitstaff is well trained and very welcoming.  Our waitress, Rachel, was friendly and very efficient.  She would be a very welcome addition to any restaurant's staff, as would Jason and the other bartenders who serve a busy bar.  The only suggestion I can make is that the restaurant consider giving consideration to improving the seasoning of its food.  I was there for lunch and had the Lobster Roll.  While it contained a generous amount of lobster and an excellent toasted roll, the filling was on the dry side and had little, if any seasoning.The location is hard to beat, right on the water with the sound of barking sea lions.  Ample parking is available and the $20 parking charge is offset by the $10 credit provided by the restaurant.,So amazing we got the breadbowl ***it spoiled our appetite *** maybe don't order it unless you want to ruin the rest of your meal lol .....the salad was fabulous as well as the crab cakes!,Great option for dining at Pier 39! We came right when they opened and got a table no problem but there was definitely a line forming already, so a reservation is a good idea. Service is good- all the staff are nice and professional.Sourdough rolls are warm and have a great texture. Good way to start. Could have eaten so many of these.Crab cakes had a good amount of crab in them and were nice and crunchy on the outside. Good flavor and a nice sauce to balance out the saltiness of the crab cake. Clam chowder is pretty decent, not as heavy and cream-forward as other chowders I've had, but I feel it's a good option if you're craving a soup. Very filling as well.Cioppino was my favorite thing. The sauce is somewhere between a tomato soup and a pasta sauce consistency, and you're going to want to dip your bread in it. The crab meat is lumped right on top in a big pile. Lots of bits of seafood like mussels, clams, fish, shrimp, and it's all so flavorful. A must have in San Fran.Total, this meal was about $100 including tip. I feel it's a little pricey, but food is well executed and service is good. Also can't beat the view- it's right on the pier and if you sit by the window you can see the sea lions with the Golden Gate Bridge in the distance.,One of our favorite seafood places in the Fisherman's wharf area. It's a bit hard to make reservation but we managed to make a booking for lunch on the weekend. Many people come for the seafood and their clam chowder. Three of us all ordered a sourdough bread clam chowder and loved it. The chowders were very creamy and tasty. We also ordered a seafood platter which included shrimps, mussels, clams, and dungeons crabs. The platter came with linguine pasta. The seafoods were very fresh and we loved the pasta. Service was excellent and we got very attentive and quick response from our waiter. Overall, I recommend this restaurant for seafood lovers. Get the seafood platter where you can sample all your favorite seafood here.,Probably some of the best clam chowder in town! Beautiful views if you snag a window seat with fresh chowder. The cioppino is also solid as is the calamari.Pro tip: check the Yelp waitlist before heading over to get on the list.,Visiting from Georgia and came here based on a recommendation from my concierge and it did not disappoint. The food was prepared quickly, as described and was very flavorful! 4 Star worthy! If you are in need of a good meal in the heart of the Wharf, this is your place. Also, the views - wow! You can't beat that! This rating is 5 stars because of my server Shawn. He was knowledgeable, warm and had a great sense of humor. While executing his duties as a well trained server he did not miss the opportunity to make us feel like old friends. He also spoke closely and clearly so that my mother who is deaf in one ear could hear (we appreciate that!).As he told us after our meal, ""Thanks for the company!"", I wanted to double down on that thanks, and thank HIM and you all for a great experience.,Food was amazing! Service was spectacular! Thank you Kailee for the great service and all the recommendations!,Not worth it or great. Went here because of the stellar reviews but damn it was expensive and not very good at all.  What happened to everyone who gave it great stars they get hit with the head with an old white sturgeon or did they have a different chef? The waitstaff was slow and mistake-y but nice. The lobster tail I had was yummy enough and the shrimp was good but maybe on par or below Red Lobster. Actually, dang! Red Lobster is so much better! We live on the coast and eat fancy fish plenty and this ain't it. The free bread rolls were loved more than the chicken tenders by a kid who wondered by no sauce with them or plum/sweet and sour or BBQ - they brought ranch when we asked. The bread rolls were alright.Update Nov 7 - reply to Resturaunt manager's reply- we went on Saturday nov 5th,Good food, quick service, beautiful view of the pier and water. I visited Fog harbor on a Monday noon around 11am. We were seated immediately as it wasn't busy that time. I went ahead and ordered the 1/2 dozen of oysters, fried calamari for appetizers. Classic Arnold Palmer for drink. For entree I went ahead and ordered the seafood platter which includes linguini, crab, clams, shrimp, and mussels sautéed in a rich buttery sauce. This platter comes in either a one person option for around $44 or 2 person for around $88. The platter was a bit on the salty side, I think they can use a little less butter as it tasted a bit overwhelming, however the seafood was well cooked, good texture, oysters were wonderful. I wish they still had the sizzling platter of seafood like shown in the pictures here. I would come back again when I'm in the area.,I came here with a large group and the service was quick! Definitely would recommend if you are in the neighborhood, it has a touristy feel but it's perfect for when you have friends visiting SF. The views were also beautiful, you can see the pier. The appetizers were alright, I didn't think it was anything special. But the steak of the surf n turf was delicious, exactly as I imagined for medium rare. The lobster tail did feel a little over cooked but not bad. If you have room for one more thing, the tiramisu was amazing! I'm very picky about my tiramisu but this one really hit the spot, it was creamy and didn't fall apart. Enjoy it with a shot of espresso on the side.,I had an amazing time eating at fog harbor! the view is something you cannot beat! Our waiter Arif did a wonderful job serving us! He was patient as we took forever to order lol. He was always making sure we had everything we needed! The crab cakes were amazing! We tried the swordfish, which was really tasty! The sauce and veggies complimented the fish very well! It was a tad overcooked but still good! I'll be back!,The food was 5 stars. We ordered clam chowder, pasta for my kid (who loves it), and a shellfish platter. Trianna was an amazing server and even asked for food allergies - which we do have. Restaurants should be asking that. They accommodated us with corner table seating because of our dog. However, we lost Trianna, without letting us know, and replaced her with an Indian lady. She was okay but she started preaching to us about our service dog and that we should not let her lick the corner/edge of the table. We told her that our dog did not but she said just in case and to not let her. Then everything went downhill. We got upset and she started patronizing us and even put her mask down and got closer to one of us when she was speaking. Overall, it's a good restaurant but we just had a so-so server.,Food was good! My friend and I ordered the clam chowder (in bread bowl) and seafood platter and it was more than enough! Seafood platter tastes really fresh, we also added lobster, though towards the end it kind of tastes oily. The sour dough tastes good.I added that we are celebrating so we were able to get a table by the window!,I have been meaning to try some classic San Francisco Clam Chowder, and I decided that Fog Harbor Fish House would be the place. I ordered the Soup/Salad Combo with the Clam Chowder Sourdough bread bowl, and Caesar salad with shrimp (shrimp suggested by waitress over chicken). The Clam Chowder was immaculate. I have nothing to compare it to, but by the time I inhaled it, I started going at the bread bowl too. The salad was just a salad, and if I went back, I would stick with ordering only the clam chowder. Another bonus is that bread is brought out before the meal, which was needed for us hangry girls after a long day of walking around SF.,Saw the raving reviews of this place and decided to try it out! We didnt have a reservation but they were able to seat us within 10 minutes. I tried the mixed grill plate (grilled salmon, pacific cod and shrimp) served with sautéed vegetables and garlic mash potatoes. Very underwhelming as I believe the seafood could use more flavoring. It was not as juicy and flavorful as I would have hoped. My favorite part of the dish was the mash potatoes. My boyfriend ordered the petrale sole which is served with fingerling potatoes, spinach and a pesto cream sauce. The dish was excellent and I felt myself leaning over to eat his dish instead of my own! The clam chowder was delicious! It was rich and creamy. Would definitely order this again! We were seated with a nice view of the sun setting down. I recommend this place if youre visiting San Francisco and want dine in at a restaurant with good seafood and views!,Everything from the drinks, the appetizers, the main course, the amazing bay views, the excellent service... all exceptional! Highly recommend!,Delicious food, price was about right, service was a bit slow but we were in no hurry, beautiful view of the bay.,Very very delicious meals. We went twice and both times we enjoyed our meals and the whole restaurant. It has great views all around. The staff is great. We had Jim and Diana as our servers and they were great! I will always come back here when we come to town.,The food was great and it is reasonably priced. We went at night so we were not able to get a view of the water but it probably has a great view. It was very busy on a Friday night, but the service was still good.,First restaurant of our week long San Francisco vacation - and I have to say:  Good choice!  My husband and I really enjoyed our meal. It was the perfect start to a fantastic trip. We didn't want to overeat because we had a large dinner planned. So we skipped the appetizers, which I always hate doing at new-to-me restaurants. I just want to try everything!I chose the Shrimp Brochette, which was very, very good! Deliciously seasoned shrimp, 12 of them on skewers. Excellent flavor!  Served with mashed potatoes and sautéed green beans and peppers.  Super yummy; very happy with this one.My husband got the Cioppino, and he LOVED it. Shrimp, clams, mussels, crab, and white fish in a tomato saffron broth. Very hearty, with a wonderful warmth that makes you feel so cozy, comfy.  Personally, I prefer cozy, comfy over anything I'd ever want to eat. So satisfying. Like a hug to the soul.Service was good, too. Food came out pretty quickly.  Plus, you get nice views of Alcatraz, a bonus!,We were in the area and randomly decided to go here since it was close by. We then saw the amazing reviews on Yelp and boy were they right!!! I love that you can book a reservation or join the waitlist right through Yelp. They also accept walk ins and you can put your name at the door and they'll text you when they have a table ready for you.Now coming to the food.. I got the crab and scallop risotto and my husband got the seafood cioppino. The risotto was one of the best things I had on my trip. It was beyond delicious and I wish I lived close by to go have this again. The cioppino was also great and my husband thoroughly enjoyed it. If I'm ever in area again I'll definitely be back!!!,First time visit!! I have to say, I'll definitely be BACK!! I forgot to ask for the waiter who helped us, but there was a misunderstanding with the chowder I ordered, and he didn't hesitate to give me another one with the bowl. THEN another one with the cup!  I really appreciate how quick he was able to fix the order and didn't make a big deal out of it. Pros:- Nice view!!- Remarkable service!! - Many selections (my cousin had seafood allergy, but he was still able to have a burger instead) - The bread served in the beginning were so good haha- ideal for dates! Cons:- NONE (from my experience) You HAVE to try this restaurant!!!,Had dinner here and we put ourselves on the waitlist here on Yelp prior to arriving - super convenient! We got seated right away which was great because there was clearly a little wait. Our server Ron was awesome! Very attentive and good with tips/suggestions for our meals and drinks.  We ordered clam chowder, salad, and I also ordered a shellfish platter for 1.  It was good but I was not wowed by it. Worth a little fix if you're craving a little seafood. Noodles were literally just butter and garlic which was a little too much after a while - id probably recommend getting a side of lemon to break it up a bit.Our dessert- we got the cookie with ice cream i Don't remember the name of it but it was sooooo delish!  We would probably come back for the clam chowder bowl and this dessert honestly lol.Overall we were satisfied with our experience. They were super busy yet we didn't feel like we were left waiting forever to be attended to which was good. We were in and out for our meals in an hour which is perfect when considering the parking rates in the area. Also - views of the ocean is a huge bonus!,Delicious. The swordfish melted in your mouth. French fries were crispy. Cheeseburger was juicy. Apple crisp was very flavorful. Service could have been friendly but I've come to realize that's just the state. Must try!,We came here a year ago, and it was one of the most delicious meals I had ever had. So of course it was top of our list to come back to. I actually came here two nights in a row -- once when I had the night to myself and once for dinner with my husband. When I came on my own, I sat at the bar and ordered the cioppino. It was absolutely delicious! I would've given 5 stars based just on that visit, but we did have some minor issues the following night.I ordered the exact same thing I did a year ago -- mussels & fries and twin lobster tails. It was all good, but not the ""OMG, this is the best lobster I've ever had in my life!"" experience it had been the year before. We were at a very small table with barely enough room for both our plates and drinks. So it was especially annoying that our main dishes were brought out when we were only about halfway through the appetizer. That's a big pet peeve of mine anyway, but there was nowhere to put all this food on the tiny table, so we had to put our drinks & appetizer plates in the window sill, and the table was still completely cramped. Then our wine came, and the ice bucket also had to go on the table because they don't have ice bucket stands. There was either a leak in the bucket, or just crazy amounts of condensation because a huge puddle formed on the table and got my husband's arm wet. We had to use both our napkins and ask for extras just to keep the puddle from spilling into his lap over the course of the meal. So, I have to say Fog Harbor is not quite as good as it was a year ago, but it's still one of the best seafood places in the area, and I would certainly come back for that cioppino!,Very mediocre. Had a reservation for 7 at 7pm, didn't get seated until 7:30pm. Though the manager comp'd some apps and apologized, still annoyed that we had to wait 30 mins when we had a reservation.Food: 2/5 def had better, not vegan friendly. Server said they can make some sautéed veggies with EVOO and garlic. However, I was served some boiled flavorless French beans and broccoli.Other parties mentioned food (mixed grill) came out room temp and clam chowder was so thick it was almost the texture of mashed potatoes.,I was hesitant to book this place as it is in Pier 39 but since my brother  was in from out of town and it had good reviews I went ahead and booked a table for 4.  We decided on 3pm on a weekday and the place inside was very full.   We had reservations were seated at a nice booth with a magnificent view of water outside.  We started with a bottle of wine while waiting to decide what to order.  Starters included the Salad and soup combination and one Caesar Salad and they were generous with the bread.  So, my husband and I split the whole steamed crab and I couldn't finish my portion so he finished it for me.  My brother had the mixed grill and his girlfriend had the Cioppino - both dishes were excellent.  Our waitress put the entire order in at the same time so we were 1/3 of the way through our starters (salads, soups, bread, wine, etc.) when the meal came out extremely rushed.  We struggled to move the dishes around because there was little room on the table with no help from the staff.  They really need to watch the table to see progression or perhaps I just need to put I need to put in the starters first and then put the main dish orders later when we are ¾ finished with our salads.If you like seafood and want to take out of towners to have an experience with a view try this place.  I am happy to return to Fog Harbor but next time I will pace the meal.  The food and view is a 4 star bu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 the service is a 2.0.,Wonderful all around! Great location in Pier 39, incredible food, service and touch of class! If you're lucky enough to be seated in the back with full views of the docks and sea lions do it! We were able to warm up with amazing chowder bowls while watching the power of wills between dock workers and incredibly sly sea lions (they aren't supposed to be on the boat docks because they damage them. Don't worry, they have a whole designated section built just for them). One playful giant was full of sass and kept getting pushed off by workers to just jump on the next one. Over and over. It was hilarious). Can be a little spendy but worth the splurge!,Overdue review for Fog Harbor fish House. You would think a restaurant located in a very touristy area, Pier 39,  would be mediocre at best. Not the case with Fog Harbor. The food there is excellent, not what I expected. I had the mixed grill. Now I don't know if the fish is pre frozen, but what I had tasted extremely fresh and tender. The garlic mash potatoes were also a surprise, whipped to perfection and flavorful. I suspect everything on the menu is going to be good, but I think that mixed grill will be a main stay for me when I go there. Easy 5 stars.,It's my second time here and didn't disappoint. The taste and quality is still the same. I had the clam chowder, baked mussels, calamari and fresh mussels. Bong Jovi, our server is very are attentive and offered excellent customer service. This is my spot when I'm visiting Fisherman's Wharf.,We had an amazing dinner here.  I had made reservations a couple of weeks in advance and requested a table with a view of the bay.  We arrived to a super busy restaurant but got the table we were hoping for!  I had the shrimp brochette, and it was so tasty.  Twelve shrimp grilled perfectly, with a small carafe of drawn butter.  Side dishes were garlic mashed potatoes & asparagus.  My daughter had a Caesar salad & clam chowder in a bread bowl.  She loved both! Service was exceptional.  This is one of the nicer restaurants in the Fisherman's Wharf area, and if you're in the mood for seafood," it's a definite """"must"""" to visit.",The restaurant is located right at pier 39. If you're able to snatch a window table, you would get to enjoy the amazing view of pier 39! Pro: Free on premise wifi Food: The bread bowl was huge! The sour bread was fresh and yummy! The clam chowder was a little thick, but flavourful. I would recommend sharing this between two people, or having it as a main!,Great view of the harbor. Drink were good. The clam chowder was delicious. My lobster roll was also good. I took off a star because my husband didn't like the cod that came with his salmon.,Right on the pier and fresh seafood! We got the crab and scallops risotto which wasn't overly creamy just right.  The fries were good! We also got the baked oysters and garlic crab.  I'd skip the crab but the risotto was solid.  The clam chowder said award winning and it's was delicious! Clean and nice ambiance!,It was our second visit to the place. And I liked it better this time. Wife wanted to share crab with her mom during her visit and fog harbor is one of the good ones!They shared half a crab. They thought it could do away with little more seasoning but 4.5/5 for the prep including apron. They could ideally finish 1 whole Dungeness crab. I ordered patrak sole with fingerling potatoes with capers and herbed butter. It went perfectly well ( surprisingly) with light lager. 5/5. Rest of the group liked it so much we ordered one more to share!! That's rare for us. We also had lemon ginger and strawberry nojito. Overall the bill was $170 ( bruschetta,half roasted garlic butter crab, 2 sole dishes , 2 beers and 2 non alcoholic drinks)We went at 3 pm with reservation through yelp. If you want to dine in between 12-2 reserve early. ( days)We requested window seat and got one!! Thanks to reception staff. We sorted 10 sea lions lasting on pier 39. Our serving crew was polite and served with huge smile. Overall definitely going back for big meal when we plan one with dear ones!Tip- definitely ask for bread for the table. It's delicious,Fog Harbor ReviewWe were very excited to visit Fog Harbor due to their great reviews and they did Not disappoint! I want to say this is the first time I give any Restaurant 5 Stars! Everything from the views to the meal and the service were above par! The restaurant is beautiful and inviting, plus the restroom was very clean which is a must during these uncertain times. I'd like to Thank Luis, our Waiter who took exceptional care of us during our visit.  We had a bowl of chowder and the scallops and risotto with a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, Amazing!,I was here for the Salesforce conference and we were all together a group of 14. After watchin the sunset by the seals we decided to walk up here and see if we could get a table. Good news we were able to get a table for 10. We all at a long table and made the table for 10 work for 14. it was a little tight but the good thing was that next to us there was a table of 4, about 30 mins after we were there they got up and we were able to take over the table. We ordered two bottles of wine and a couple of the people at the table go cocktails. I was not drinking as it had been a long day of traveling. We started our dinner with fresh oysters. They were delicious and you can tell that they are really fresh. We also got the tuna poke, I liked that it had fresh avocado and fresh mango at the same time. For my main course I ordered the Cioppino it was a great portion and it had a lot of fresh seafood. I absolutely loved it because it was unlike anything I have had a in my life. With the weather being a little chilly outside it was perfect. Overall, I liked this place it had a good ambience, good food, and good service. If you are thinking about going, go!,Best garlic crab I've had in a long time! Food was excellent across the board. With special shout out to our server Bong Jovi (yes! That's his name!) who was friendly, attentive, and super helpful. We're SF locals and had a great time. We'll be back!,We got the Raw Oysters, Calamari, Linguine with Clams, Caesar salad, and Dessert Duo. My notable mentions would be the Linguine and Calamari. Plenty of clams and garlic flavor in the pasta, and the calamari was nicely fried with a creamy sauce on the side. I wish the Caesar salad was cut up. The service was very good, and the restaurant itself was very pretty at night with a view of the pier.,If your craving delicious Clam Chowder and decadent Crab. You'll know you've reached the correct restaurant when you enter Fog Harbor on Fisherman's wharf. My boyfriend and I both ordered the Award winning clam chowder in a delicious Sourdough Bread bowl. To start our meal which was rich and creamy with a lot of clams, the seasonings were a perfect blend. I would highly recommend starting your meal with the chowder. Then we shared the Shellfish Tower and swapped out the raw oysters for the Baked oysters that were cooked in a creamy Parmesan sauce. Absolute perfection was achieved when their chef made these. The Seafood on the platter was fresh and the crab so sweet and delicious that there was no need for butter. If your craving seafood and your in San Francisco. I highly recommend eating here.,Food was delicious!Scallop & crab risotto was our favorite Thank you bong kogi for your excellent service!!,Really good food with a great view! Service was really good and the food was fresh and tasted delicious. A bit pricey but the food and flavor where  worth the price !,We walked over here after trying a less successful & satisfying restaurant in the same complex and made up for it by eating 2nd dinners in the same night.  The clam chowder was delicious and the potatoes were not mushy or over cooked with good size clams and the best piece of side bread and fresh salted butter.  The seafood platter was so yum & fresh and laid at the bottom with garlic butter linguine... cannot comment on anything else but it's definitely a repeat place to eat.  Haleigh was our server and she was a gem and very helpful and friendly.,The reviews were great, but honestly i felt it was just ok. Seemed like a typical tourist spot were the food was mediocre. The service was ok, not great, but not the worst. The bread was very good. I ordered the muscle fries. They had a sweet Vidalia onion flavor. No need for fries bc they were soggy wo much flavor. My boyfriend ordered a pesto chicken pasta and it was again mediocre.,Best food every time we come. Join the wait list online and skip the line. Also, services was great from the greeting to the end. We got a great server not only congratulated my guest on her bday but also took the time to bring her a very delicious dessert. Thank you for that, I didn't catch his name, but he was a VERY tall gentleman.,This place is busy. Our server was very friendly and worked very hard. The food is great! We had clam chowder, steamed clams, clam pasta, and drinks. The clam chowder is so good with the bread! We enjoyed our visit here. My son wasn't feeling well that evening. He got food poisoning from this place so I took off one star.,OVERALLI appreciate the good service I received sitting at the bar. The bartenders were knowledge, friendly, and weren't trying to upsell you in getting something to make your bill more. FOODI got the clam chowder and sourdough rolls. I was pleasantly surprised by the taste of chowder. It wasn't bad but it wasn't anything to rave about. I think the scoop they gave me didn't have any seafood chunks in it at all. It was more soupy and less 'meat'. The flavor was good but I wish it was heartier with seafood. The sourdough rolls were amazingly delicious and served hot. That was a redeeming quality to the chowder being subpar.DRINKI got their moscow mule and it was pretty light. I think their measurements are off.HOT TIPDon't get the clam chowder in a bread bowl. Rather get a large clam chowder and you get free sourdough bread on the side and can ask for more. When you go for happy hour you have to ask for the happy hour menu as they don't readily provide it to you.,This is a must visit restaurant when visiting SF!! Highly recommend! Went on thanksgiving day and surprisingly there was only a 10 min wait. There was more ppl than I thought dining out . First year having no Turkey on thanksgiving, this year is a seafood thanksgiving haha! We had a nice view next to the pier , can see the boat. Ordered the below items:Oyster- very fresh and loved it with the cocktail sauce Clam chowder- originally wanted to get boudin but any restaurant near the pier makes fresh and delicious chowderLinguine and clams pasta- clams were fresh but tiny. Good flavor! Mixed grill- vegetables were cooked nicely with red bell peppers, came with buttery and soft mashed potatoes, grilled salmon, pacific cod and shrimp Would come back again if I'm visiting SF!,Came with no reservation & was still seated in about 10 mins. That was awesome! Ordered lobster tator tots,fish n chips and clam chowder. Sooooo good!! All of it!The waiter was extremely nice and on top of everything! Even during lunch time rush. The tables are definitely packed in this place. Pretty much on top of each other, but I get it.Try to reserve a table by the window.Such a beautiful view!,We came in for lunch on New Year's Eve (the wettest day ever recorded in San Fran). We were only in town for two nights, so we weren't going to miss out on the touristy stuff. The restaurant was warm and inviting and packed even though they had just opened. I thought this would be a typical tourist place with a great view and mediocre food at a hefty price, but let me tell you the service, drinks, and food were all excellent. It was so nice to get out of the rain, warm up and have a great meal. I can't eat gluten so I wasn't able to try the chowder in a bread bowl, but my gosh it lookedDelish. Our table had fish and chips, cioppino , salmon, and pasta. It wasn't cheap but it was worth it. We will be back next time we are in townFor sure.,This place is located on Pier 39, in the heart of tourist heaven LOL.  We were coming because so many people had told us this is THE place for clam chowder (and they were right).  We got to the area early and actually really enjoyed walking around the cute little shops and enjoying views of the bay.  Highly recommend reservations as the place was packed around 5:30 on a Thursday and there were plenty of people waiting too.Our server Luis was personable and informative.  We went with his recommendations and all were absolutely spot on.  Cup of clam chowder to start and share.  The two complimentary rolls/butter made this one of the best appetizers we've had!  For our meals we went with the Cioppino and Scallops/Crab Risotto.  The Cioppino had plenty of seafood in a flavorful tomato broth.  The Risotto was creamy without being heavy and the stewed tomatoes just took it up a notch.  Dessert was another recommendation from Luis which was the warm chocolate cake with whip cream.  We shared but honestly, we could have both finished one on our own!!  Wonderful dining experience.,We had lunch there after the morning Alcatraz tour.  The was was about 20mins. Nothing really stood out for us, we enjoyed the chowder and the burger.  Good view of the sea lions and the pier area.  I have no other chowder to compare it to, but it's better than the can chowder. Cool place!,Very happy I choose this place to celebrate my birthday , the chowder was BOMB.com very pleased with my dinner and experience especially when you can add crab meat to anything . Service was excellent as well,We celebrated an excellent Christmas dinner at Fog Harbor Fish House! The wait time was less than we expected and the service was exceptional!The  Cioppino is  the best in the SF Bay Areaand so was our waiter Ted!The manager was attentive bringing us pillows to make the chairs cozy. This place aims to please and does not miss a beat. So good we returned two weeks later for Seafood Cioppino again.,It's a cute place and the seafood plater was delightful 3 people shared it with 5 apps and 2 tails,Luis was our amazing server this evening! We got sat right away with a gorgeous view of the pier and the sea lions. The food was just right proportions wise and perfect taste wise.The drinks were great too. 5/5,First time at Fig Harbor Fish House. Found it on Yelp and dropped in for a light dinner. We arrived at 5:00 PM. The formal side was pretty full so we went over to the casual side, which was 1/4 full. Our server, Jim, was outstanding. We greeted us immediately, offered water and sourdough rolls and asked us if we had any questions. He gave us the perfect amount of attention and gave recommendations for dinner. We were still pretty full from brunch, so we shared a 1/2 seafood platter. It turned out to be plenty of food, full of a half-crab, clams, mussels and shrimp plus garlic-butter pasta. It was very filling and was plenty of food for a heavy eater or two light eaters. We added an iced tea and glass of house wine, bringing to total to $74.71 plus tip. We especially liked the old school nautical and  Bay Area decor throughout the restaurant. Light jazz played somewhere and, with a great view of the sun setting on the bay, we had a perfect last meal in San Francisco.,Made a reservation for a Wednesday at 8pm and was able to get a spot a day in advance with yelp reservations. We parked a couple blocks down on the street which had meter parking for free. I recommend if this , if you do not want to pay the for the garage across from pier 39. However they do validate if needed but I believe you still have to pay $10 regardless.Once seated we were greeted within minutes. We ordered oysters and calamari for appetizers which were very good and our waitress also gave us bread as well which I really enjoyed! They were super soft and moist. For my main entrée I ordered the Salmon with the noodles. I thought the dish was ok, but the noodles threw me off a bit since it had ginger and a green/creamy sauce that was not my cup of tea. However the Salmon was good and cooked well.I do enjoy the ambiance here. It was very nice even though it was foggy and could not see much outside. I think this place would be a good place for a cute dinner date spot or lunch time!,The food was amazing! I had a salmon BLT! The salmon was fresh and the bacon crispy. My husband had fish and chips he said it was good. We ordered delicious calamari and the garlic bread for starters. I definitely recommend coming here for the food. The service was so good. From the receptionists to our server. Her name is Lindsay and she was great! She was very friendly and nice. She even helped me chose which entre to have when I couldn't decide between two. She definitely made our experience here a good one! I love how we had a window view of the ocean it was beautiful to watch the water and boats while eating. Overall it was just amazing!! Definitely will be back when in town again.,This resto is located second flr of fisherman's wharf pier 39. Fancy resto overlooking the bay & GGB. Service, ambiance, and food are thumbs up! Our server was great as well. A lil pricey but its reasonable given the service, location, and food. I recommend this place.,First time here and we will be coming back. Great location. Great service, not rushed and very friendly. Luis is super. Tell him I sent you!,I see why they have 8400 plus reviews!  The view, large plates, and the seafood.  Discount with AAA card.  The service was excellent.  Restroom was clean.  Got to wash hands in order to eat crab because you're going to lick your finger coated with garlic butter.  Scallop and crab risotto.  What a combination! Perfect.  Watch the butter solidify.  The seafood platter with half a crab with noodles was so darn yummy.  Crab was sweet and meaty.  Yesterday was first day of crab season, so i hope this crab came from the ocean yesterday.  Ok, it was rainy.  We took a chance, and there was no wait.  We got an excellent window seat.  So happy!  Parked in parking lot, remember to get validation for 1 hour free.    Of course we enjoyed our dinner for less than two hours.  Just convenient to walk over the bridge from parking to restaurant!  How convenient!  Everything about the dinner was delicious.  I hope you enjoy yourself as much as i did.  Got leftovers.  Cook some extra noodles and got another meal.,Fog Harbor is well known for their amazing seafood dishes.  I want to comment on their other dishes, the steaks!My son and I love to eat at good steak houses here in San Francisco.  We both agree that Fog Harbor has an amazing if not the best filet in the city.  My son (13) likes his filet medium well (yes I know) his comments is the filet is tender and almost melts in your mouth.  My filet was medium and had a nice char while still keeping on the medium side through out the filet.  The grill marks added to the taste and presentation.  My drink was a mojito and unlike some other restaurants had a fair amount of alcohol.  Not over powering.  I felt it was just right. As far as the service goes, nice staff.  Food came out at a good pace even with it being as busy as it was.  Nice view, ask for one if you can.  You may wait a little longer but worth it.,We dined here during our trip to SF. They are located on Pier 39, so expect a lot of tourists in this area. We were able to be seated near the window and earlier than our reservation time, which was great!We started off with a bottle of Chateau Ste. Michelle Reisling and complimentary sourdough bread rolls. The rolls were so good! I ordered a clam chowder bread bowl and the chowder was very flavorful! The shellfish tower was warm, instead of the usual chilled ones I've gotten in the past. There was crab legs, clams, potatoes, shrimp, and toasted bread! It was definitely very filling for two people! For dessert," they bring out a tray with all the selections and we ended up with the tiramisu! It was so moist and yummy! Thanks Bongjovi for taking care of us!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lily,"I have been here a few times for dinner already and each time the service and food has been wonderful. I know that a lot of people end up writing poor reviews of this place because they are too cheap about the mandatory 20% tip, but I feel like the staff here honestly do their best to earn that tip. They work hard and it shows every time that I have been.It's been awhile since my last visit, but there was this curry pork shank that was phenomenal. We shared a couple of dishes as well, but it was really the shank that stood out to us all. The meat practically falls off the bone and mixed with the curry and accompanying rice, it was mouth watering. Hope they see this review and might revive that dish at a later time.Our table of 6 ordered drinks and many other dishes to share as well, and the crowd were a bunch of foodies. So the fact that it pleased a crowd who are used to dining at Michelin star restaurants, Lily must be doing something right. The cocktail drinks were more on the delicious than potent. If somebody wants to actually ""feel"" the alcohol, I recommend ordering off the wine list or ask the server to bring a more classic cocktail from the bar. I personally like a glass of brut rose or sparkling wine.The ambience of the restaurant was moderately loud, but still cozy. It's a great location for a date or more intimate experience with a small group.I'll look forward to the next time I can make my way back. It's been several months.,I found a luxurious drink that is worth a trip to Richmond, SF from anywhere in the world. Rob Lam, the chef behind the Vietnamese restaurant @lilyonclement created an Asian inspired drink that will have you asking for several glasses. Their hot apple cider is made with freshly pressed apple juice, Tullamore Dew Irish whiskey, red jujube, five spiced whip cream.Be sure to also get the jackfruit pizza that comes with delicate scissors, pea leaf & cilantro chao, and everything else on the menu. In fact be sure to order 2 jackfruit pizzas. And their congee. And their soups. Everything. Get it all. I would follow Rob wherever he goes and I'm so happy he made Lily a place worthy of global food excellence in the Bay Area - which is rare cuz the food here is subpar - so thank you Rob & Lily!Rob also is the chef at @perlewinebaroakland where their bone marrow dish is off the hook.,You'll need to make reservations for Lily online using their reservation booking website. There's option for table or bar. Restaurant is long and has fairly good seating, lots of reservation options the day or two prior to going but the table option filled up quickly! Came on MLK day and had the best time talking to the staff while waiting. Didn't catch the name but he was very funny/charismatic. Our waiter was very nice as well. Most staff that we spoke to was very nice. We ordered the jackfruit pizza appetizer and it was delicious. It was sweet a little sweet! It came with a scissor to cut pieces of the pizza. Lots of different but delicious looking appetizers to choose from! It was hard to just get one. Drinks: my friend ordered the Rodriguez Farms strawberry sinh toI had the kiwi cucumber crush. I must say it was a bit too sour for my taste  and wish I got a sweeter drink. For dinner my friends got:Garlic noodles with added chicken - very delicious, you can't go wrong with garlic noodles. Wok seared vegetarian chow fun - despite being my friends choice, I'd say this was actually my favorite dish of the night. Super flavorful, the tofu was delicious I couldn't get enough! When I took my first bite my eyes lit up with pleasant surprise and I secretly wished I ordered this one. I got the 2nd place beef noodle soup -pho Bo- despite it being 2nd place it was sooooo good. Very flavorful, the broth had a cinnamon taste that came out more than I've ever had in other pho. I like the added bread to dip in the soup and even had leftovers which taste just as good!,My husband and I with our little baby girl tried this restaurant yesterday for brunch/lunch. We arrived around 11:15pm and no one was in there (people started to appear around noon). We chose just two dishes: the garlic noodle for me (I added the chicken) and the broken rice for my husband. My portion was huge (it feeds at least 2 people), but I ate by myself. I really enjoyed it. Flavors are strong, but everything is well mixed so you can taste every ingredients in the plate. Also my husband liked his plate a lot. The service was pretty good and we enjoyed also the ambience.The only problem for us was they didn't have a changing station for our baby (as many places in the city). But they were very gentle because they gave us a red envelope for our baby.,Worth the try: BBQ broken rice, garlic noodles, probably everything else (wish I could've ordered more!)Tip: There's an automatic 20% service charge, which is great, just something to be aware of!Bonus tip: This is a modern Asian fusion place. Don't expect something extremely traditional, and be okay with the price you're going to pay.#1 Vietnamese BBQ Broken Rice Plate: grilled pork, lemongrass chicken,  blue shrimp, duck spring roll, fried golden egg with rice. A modern take on com tam (broken rice), loved the variety of items and the amount of texture and flavor each brought to the dish. Garlic Noodles: noodles with bok choy, shiitake mushrooms, peppers, toasted garlic, and shallots. Delicious noodle dish, loved how many veggies were in it and how you could add your choice of protein. Wish it were a bit more garlicky though.SERVICE: Servers were kind and attentive. It got busier during lunch so it took a while to get our check, but we didn't mind. Shoutout to the owner who made us feel welcomed and comfortable, as if we were his own family enjoying a meal at home.ATMOSPHERE: elevated looking Viet restaurant with tons of seating and an open kitchen layout. Very clean with gender neutral bathrooms. Everything screams modern Asian fusion, but in a good way.PARKING: Street parking available nearby (typical SF).My friend took me here after having it bookmarked for a while. We got there around 11:30AM, and it was absolutely packed by the time we left (12:30/1:00PM AKA prime lunch time). I wish I could've tried more dishes because everything tasted great! Portions are large and there's a good variety on the menu. Definitely worth the try if you're looking for a twist on traditional Viet food!,Was craving some viet food and my friend recommended this spot. I've heard about it a couple times so thought I'd finally give it a try. Interior is very warm and cozy, with table seating and the bar seating. I'd recommended the chefs bar and not the regular bar though since you'll be at the windows facing outside. Service was a little lacking since we sat at the bar near the windows and had to flag someone down to help us after 15 min. COCKTAILSStrawberry Daiquiri: Really nice twist on a classic daiquiri. Not as sweet as other ones I've had and they added pop rocks candy to provide a little crunch which was interesting. Can't taste the alcohol and basically is a smoothie. 4/5Green Jasmine Iced Tea: In contrast with the daiquiri, this one was really spirit forward and I didn't enjoy it. It really tasted like a green tea with a shot or two added to it without any other mixers to add dimension. 2/5APPFried Tofu: Love the choice of using a soft tofu rather than regular tofu for this. Regular tofu is a little too firm and always has that skin when fried. I believe here, cornstarch or some other starch was used to fry the tofu, adding a nice crispy skin to the tofu which gave it overall more texture. The mustard dipping sauce was ok though since I'm not a fan of mustard, but tofu by itself was good. 4.5/5MAINSBo Ne: This was a really good dish. Filet mignon was cooked to perfection. Scallops were slightly crispy on the outside with that nice crust while remaining soft and juicy on the inside. The special XO pate that came with the bread was the show stopper though. I would literally buy their XO pate if they sold it. 4.25/5Bo Kho: I might be a little biased since my mom made a different style of Bo Kho and not the Hue style that Lily makes it. Broth was super rich and very nostalgic of how I like Bo Kho. However the oxtail was not my favorite. The meat was a little gelatinous and wasn't pleasant to eat. 3/5DESSERTBanana Pudding (?): I forgot the exact name but that's what I think this was LOL Super moist and flavorful and the banana had a nice brûlée to it. It wasn't too sweet either, making the dessert enjoyable and not too decadent. 4/5Overall, I had a decent experience. Since I'm used to cheaper viet food the pricing threw me off but I can see myself maybe coming back if I ever want to try more elevated/fine dining viet food.,My third time dining here, this place is obviously becoming a fav!  The interior design is esthetically beautiful and exotic with luxurious Asian wallpaper and carved woods. Their food matches the interior design--creative twists, unique blends of textures & flavors, makes each experience here an enjoyable one! Every entree, gorgeously presented, not only a feast for the eyes--but also a feast for the tastebuds!Some of my favorite dishes here are FRIED PRAWNS & SWEET POTATOES (appetizer),  WOK SEARED CHOW FUN with shaking beef,   TURMERIC FRIED CATFISH,  VIETNAMESE BBQ BROKEN RICE PLATE,  and SIZZLING FILET MIGNON & SCALLOPS SKILLET.Since I'm not a drinker, it's nice to see a non-alcoholic drink menu made with equal whimsy as the alcoholic cocktail menu. Lily does both! We enjoyed these three non-alcoholic drinks: STRAWBERRY SINH TO made with LIME SINH TO & VIETNAMESE ICED COFFEE topped with condensed milk, salty duck egg crema! All were very yummy!One note to make, the noise level can get pretty intense when a full house. We found ourselves talking loudly to one another just to be heard. Would suggest installation of sound panels to bring down the reverberation.  If you're expecting a quiet romantic dinner, this is not what you'll find! It's a lively place!Other than that, the food here is exceptional! Will come back with more friends to experience Lily's delicious cuisine!,Parents were in town and I'd seen good things online about Lily, so brought them here for dinner the evening after Thanksgiving! Busy and full around 6pm but still able to grab a seat immediately at the bar. Lovely, lively ambiance inside with gorgeous decorative mural along the walls. While most of the restaurant is dimly lit and intimate, the open kitchen is bright and bustling -- we actually were fascinated watching the chefs work sitting right in front of the oven while they cooked. Calamari was delicious, perfectly paired with fruity and floral notes. Filet Mignon was also good, done medium rare, but unfortunately a little charred on the outside. Scallops were delightful, though a bit heavy handed on the salt. There's fun little surprises tucked into the plate, like sausages, bread, and dip. The garlic noodles with beef were the most disappointing. It was so very salty that we left around 3/4 of the dish untouched. However, the chef and waiter said it was usually not the case (perhaps just a simple mistake) and that the dish was very popular. Nevertheless, they responded to the feedback kindly and promptly. Overall, Lily offers a pleasant dining experience. Its attention to detail, whether in the environment or in the dishes themselves, is impressive and their service is impeccable. Ultimately, we didn't feel inclined to return, given that the quality of the food relied more heavily on presentation rather than taste and fell short of justifying its high price point.,I came here because my friend date is an vegan and I thought they might have some awesome vegetarian options. When I got here, people here are very nice and welcome. Our waiter is helpful and handsome! Lol. We ordered one appetizer and two entrées. We loved food here. The jackfruit pizza is interesting, but probably not my type of tea. However, I absolutely loved two entrées. My garlic noddles has a big portion with a decent amount of shrimp, and my friends's tough and rice cake is my favorite for sure!!! The only thing I would say anything negative about this place is the price. It is quite pricy. Three dishes was above $100 with a mandatory 20% tip for lunch. I would probably come back for trying other options. If the price can be more friendly, it would definitely be a plus.,Arrived on Sunday morning for lunch. Parking can be difficult to find as there is weekly (?) farmer's market right outside the restaurant.  I'd describe this place as an upscale take on Vietnamese food. I was disappointed that they didn't have the duck spring rolls available but was able to try other great dishes. We got the calamari, garlic noodles, and the heritage pork bowl. The garlic noodles was a tad bit salty. The pork bowl was very flavorful. Cool place to try at least once.,My friend and I loveeeed our dinner at Lily. We've both been wanting to try it for a while, and i'm glad we finally did! The food here is so creative and the presentation is so pretty.We ordered:- Beef carpaccio $26: I loved the addition of bone marrow in this! It definitely tasted decadent and rich. I wish they gave more of the rice cracker though.- Jackfruit pizza $18: We heard this was popular so we got it--no regrets!! I LOVE jackfruit but I couldn't imagine it on ""pizza"". All the flavors played well together into a perfect bite.- Shaking beef salad $32: Another popular dish--this was good but not a favorite. It was a good portion and the beef was very tender, but the flavors fell a little short for me. The price is also a little high.- Vietnamese coffee creme brulee $12(?): We weren't gonna get dessert but this was so tempting! I love creme brulee and this did not disappoint. We were surprised to see how big it was and the gold flakes on top! It had a perfectly crackly sugar crust and a creamy balanced creme.Lily is definitely pricy, but so worth it. I'd love to come again with girlfriends or my hubby!,Tl;dr: high end viet food that doesn't match its price or taste.-fooooood-Cha gio vit kieu phap: Deep fried ""spring rolls"" were very dry. It was just duck wrapped inside, kinda like tuna in a can. Sauce was a fancy description of honey mustard. I personally wasn't a fan of their take on cha gio.Carpaccio: the best dish here. Bone marrow was perfect. Put all 3 ingredients for an explosion of flavor in your mouth.Bun cha: it's all in the broth and the broth wasn't there. The meats inside were also a little dry.Chow fun: It was okay. They were rolled like Chinese ""cherng fun"" with Maggie seasoning and lemon as a sauce. Nothing special except its price.,I enjoyed my recent visit to Lily and will likely be back again in the future, but with a smaller group! There were 8 of us, so we ordered the first set menu. The friendly owner came out and joked that he hoped we had plenty of room, because there would be a LOT of food. And he was absolutely right - we all ended up taking a lot of food home with us (yay for leftovers!). Here were my highlights:* Spring rolls were great!* Chow fun - probably my favorite dish, very fun to eat* Garlic noodles - packed with flavor* Fried catfish - excellent (but I was pretty full by the time this was served so I had to eat the majority of this dish the next day)I didn't care as much for the jackfruit ""pizza,"" but others at the table loved it and the interesting use of ingredients. I am don't posses much of a sweet tooth, so while the chocolate pot de crème was quite tasty, I didn't eat much of it.,I'll tell you straight up... if you're looking for something straight from the motherland and authentic as can be, this isn't it... Lily takes it to the next level and brings Vietnamese cuisine to higher levels than grandma's recipe.The chef introduces new flavor combinations that work with the true definition of Vietnamese food, but you have to be open to it... Bone Marrow Pho is pricey, but it is good. Black Truffle Banh Xeo, pushing boundaries but it's good. Garlic Noodles, not traditional but it's damn good. Come here with an open mind of new flavor combinations and taste buds, and you'll enjoy it. BTW, the drinks are really good; not too strong that makes you wince. @phidingthefam,Oh my GOODNESS. This place is incredible. Every dish that came out to different tables, we wanted to try. This is the best carpaccio you will find with a Vietnamese twist. The menu is limited because every plate is a winner. Everything was fantastic, from the service to the food! Try the Heritage pork and the Garlic noodles. Make reservations!,Set a series of unwarranted fireworks in the middle of the day while Clement street farmers market was going. I would highly recommend against going to the Vietnamese restaurant Lily on Clement again. The owner set of a huge firework in the middle of the crowded market with no heads up. Folks thought there was a bomb and were taking cover. He then proceeded to be a huge jerk about people asking him why he did it.,Came here for a Labor Day brunch with my family, and we were blown away! I have frequented Vietnamese restaurants for years, but Lily has a charming atmosphere unlike any other.FOODShaking Beef Salad (5/5): This was my favorite dish! The flavors were so bright and distinct, and all the ingredients came together beautifully. The beef melts in your mouth and is sooo juicy. I especially loved the dressing, which was tangy and fresh.Garlic Noodles with Shrimp (4/5): Super flavorful and delicious! The portion size was generous, and it was seasoned well.Broken Rice Plate (5/5): Really good! The pork and chicken were both tender, and I loved the spring rolls. DRINKJasmine Green Iced Tea (4/5): The first sip of this drink was absolutely delightful -- I could taste all the fruit, sweetness, and green tea flavor. The rest of the drink was a bit too bitter for me, but I have a sweet tooth and tend to cop out when it comes to drinks, so I would still recommend this drink!I had a lovely experience here and definitely recommend checking this place out!,Came here for dinner, and the food was pretty good overall.- jackfruit pizza: super pretty, but it was just okay. We didn't finish the whole thing, and I normally finish everything in front of me- BBQ Berkshire pork chop with broken rice: this was my favorite thing we got. The pork chop was huge and really yummy!- surf and turf garlic noodles: this was tasty, but it was just like a typical noodle dish so not that special,Every detail is exquisite... from ambiance to service to food.   Know the proprietor from his fantastic Montclair restaurant, Perle.  Was so happy to visit his Vietnamese spot in SF for lunch today.   The restaurant design and decor is gorgeous.  I had the catfish bahn mi and it was DELICIOUS.  I can't recall what my friend had ... a selection of many things - fabulous pork a duck spring roll.. every morsel was delicious.  The server was perfect, there when you needed him and subtly watching our experience.   This place is amazing.  Highly recommend.  Wish I'd taken the photo from the other angle.,Having enjoyed authentic Vietnamese cooking my whole life I'm typically skeptical of modern Vietnamese cooking as many spots I've tried are more Viet dishes catered to the American palette.Lily certainly was not that! Although a more modern take the dishes stay true to the banh mi and com tam flavors I grew up eating. The ambiance, drinks, and service was incredible on top of the delicious food. Already planning to come back soon to try the dinner menu :),Slightly overpriced for Vietnamese food and we were only impressed by one dish, the ca chien (fried whole fish). We over ordered for two people because we had high hopes. If we could do it again we would get the pina colada and green tea cocktail (a must they were so delicious) and fried chicken wings as starters. Scratch the calamari because the coating was not good. Also scratch the garlic noodles because it's 3x the price of Panda Express chow mein and not half as good BUT the filet mignon cubes were commendable. Ca chien stole the show. We were ambitious and ordered two desserts: the cafe sua da creme brulee and the pandan che. Not worth the money for the desserts at all!! Would be 3 stars but the desserts were so painfully mediocre. Cute date spot if you order right though,Came here on Thursday evening and it was packed.  It was hard to find parking as well.  We did not have reservations but we were able to grab some seats at the bar area.  We didn't realize that the restaurant changes the menu up, so some of the stuff we wanted to try was not on the menu.  We decided to get mmmmango, filet of beef carpaccio, garlic noodles with chicken, and filet mignon and diver scallops.Mmmmmango 3/5: this is a little mango smoothie with some alcohol.  I expected the mango flavor to be more intense, but it wasn't.  It was just okay.Filet of beef carpaccio 4/5: very decadent with bone marrow.  The filet carpaccio had great flavor (a little tart) and was melt in your mouth.  Love that they used the Vietnamese cracker as a vessel.   I'm. Not sure if it's worth $26 though.Garlic noodles with chicken 2/5: for garlic noodles, this had no garlic flavor.  This is like a chinese stir fry thick egg noodle.  Definitely need some sriracha to kick things up a bit.  The dish is very pretty, but had nothing to back it up.Filet mignon and diver scallops 4/5: this was very different from what we expected, as we thought this was a banh mi.  Instead, it was a rice dish with lots of filet mignon, egg, rice, diver scallops, pate, pork cake, and chinese sausage.  There was a French bread on the side, with some pate sauce and cream cheese.  The filet mignon was cooked to perfection and had great flavor.  This dish was $54, but there is a lot of filet in the entree, so it was not a bad price.  The diver scallop was very big also cooked to perfection as well.  Everything was good, but as an entree, I'm still a little unsure how I liked everything together as a dish.Overall, everything was good, 3.5 stars rounded to 4. Please note that there is an automatic service charge of 20% on top of the higher prices.,This place isn't your traditional Vietnamese restaurant! Upscale Vietnamese fusion restaurant with picturesque food/drinks! Food - Colorful, great plating, premium pricing***Duck Confit Spring Rolls $15 - Our group was obsessed with these, so delicious. There was a good amount of duck inside and the sauce paired perfectly***BBQ Rice Plate $24 - Very filling meal! Comes with grilled pork (super fatty/chewy), lemongrass chicken (my favorite meat on the plate), blue shrimp bits, and a small portion of soup! They give you 1 duck spring roll to try. My favorite part was the fried golden egg, the yolk was incredibly tastyDrinks - I loved how they used live flowers for their drink presentations***Vietnamese Ice Coffee $8 - Hands down the best one I have ever had! It has a strong coffee taste, the condensed milk wasn't overpowering, and the duck egg crema made this drink so special***Kiwi Cucumber Mash (gin cocktail) $16 - The taste was great, however, its texture tasted like a green juice. I wish they would have strained the drink before serving.***Green Jasmine Iced Tea $16 (gin cocktail) - My least favorite cocktail out of the 3. The gin was strong, however, the texture was off and it was lacking flavor. The small chunks inside the cocktail were very unpleasant. I wish they would have strained this cocktail as well. ***Strawberry Daiquiri $16 (vodka cocktail) - A MUST try, tastes like paradise! This drink was filled with strawberry flavor and had the perfect creamy texture from the farms yogurt inside.Service - Great food, however, the service was disappointing during the holiday (Labor Day) weekend- Bar service is typically faster, however, we waited a while before the bartender acknowledged and asked us for our drink order. We noticed how packed and busy this place was so we decided to order our drinks and food at the same time.- They seemed understaffed because simple requests, such as water, water refills, and our check took a whileMake a reservation- Came in for a weekend brunch without a reservation and we were told we could get a table if we waited 30 minutes. We came back 30 minutes later, but the host said our table was given away. We ended up being seated at the bar, which was a little disappointing after we requested a tableSeating- There is plenty of indoor seating, but the tables are very close to each other- Outdoor seating is available, but only 2-4 tables are available depending on the group size,Setting: Dimly lit, upscale dining vibe with open kitchen Food: Loved the unique jackfruit pizza appetizer, liked the shaking beef salad and bun rieu ($55) I would love to come back for the duck rolls and garlic noodles Service: Attentive. Water was always filled.Overall, my friend and I enjoyed the food. I would love to come back.,Wowow dinner here last night was incredible. Went with a few friends and the food was delicious. We ordered the fried tofu, chow fun with chicken, garlic noodles with beef, oxtail, and the whole fish. I was a little surprised at the price tags on the menu, but honestly the food was all so so good. The fried tofu was lightly battered and so soft on the inside. The chow fun flavors were ah-mazing and the noodles were prepared in a way I've never had before. The chicken in it was delicious too. I don't typically love garlic noodles bc I find them to be kinda plain but they were so flavorful here and the beef on top was great quality. The whole fish was delicious too. The mmmmmango drink tasted like a smoothie. The non alcoholic coffee was delicious too, and def strong.On top of the food, service was great. I'll definitely be coming back!!,2 stars just for the service and the cute restaurant dog that walks around - 0 stars for the overpriced underwhelming food. Pho ga - 6/10. Probably the dish I disliked the least. But can't really mess up on soup when I'm hungover right? Duck spring rolls - 3/10. Dry duck. Pho bo - 1/10. please do yourself a favor and do not get this. It's best to just go to a butcher shop and order roast beef. Eating this is just a mouthful of beef and that's it. Catfish - 3/10. What to get here tho is definitely their iced coffee. FYI - they charge a mandatory 20% service charge which is not counted as gratuity.,4 stars for food. Drinks, atmosphere, presentation and service boosted them to an overall 5. I'm open minded when it comes to Asian Fusion but the Bánh Tôm Cổ Ngư was disappointing. The presentation was beautiful but it was just battered shrimp shells and heavily battered sweet potato fries. The original dish is definitely way better than this reimagining. I do like the cocktails. They are creative and just outstanding!,Parents were in town and I had seen good things about Lily's online, so brought them here for dinner after Thanksgiving! Busy and packed around 6pm but still able to get a seat at the bar quickly.Beautiful, lively atmosphere inside with beautiful decorative walls along the walls. While most of the restaurant is dim and intimate, the open kitchen is bright and bustling -- we were actually fascinated to see the chefs working right in front of the oven as they cooked.The calamari was delicious, pairing perfectly with the fruity and floral notes.The Filet Mignon was also good, medium rare, but unfortunately a bit burnt on the outside. The scallops were delightful, although a bit heavy-handed on the salt. There are fun little surprises on the plate, like sausage, bread and dip.The garlic noodles with beef were the most disappointing. It was so salty that we left about 3/4 of the dish untouched. However, the chef and the waiter said that this was not usually the case (probably just a simple mistake) and that the dish was very popular. Nevertheless, they responded to feedback gracefully and promptly.Overall, Lily's offers a pleasant dining experience. Their attention to detail, whether in the setting or the dishes themselves, is impressive and their service is second to none.Ultimately, we didn't feel inclined to return, given that the quality of the food relied more on presentation than taste and failed to justify its high price.,Ordered: we ordered 6 different drinks all of them are so good We ordered the following:Spicy glazed chicken wing: okGarlic noodles: I think this is my favorite coz the garlic wasn't overpowering unlike other places Beef carpaccio: ok to share for 2 people- not a fan but my family liked it Bo Luc Lac : so good Banh Xeo nam truffle: my favorite! You have to get it Wait time: drinks took about 15 mins and food, 20-30 mins Service: short staffed, so be a lil patient Ambiance: cozy Price: a little pricey but worth it Tip: make reservations, bring your patience, parking can be challenging WIGBA (would I go back again): Yes, definitely a good place to go with your friends,I tried the Duck Confit Eggrolls, Surf & Turf Garlic Noodles, and Roast Duck Noodle Soup. Perhaps it was the dishes that I ordered, but they didn't quite meet the expectations I had going in overall; taking into consideration both flavor and price point. The duck in both of the eggrolls and noodle soup were quite dry and lacking in prominent flavors, making it difficult to enjoy without searching for sauce. While the soup broth and shrimp xiu mai were nice, there was nothing incredibly standout or memorable about it -- a little disappointing, but I suppose that's on me for expecting something more interesting or with a bit finer execution.My favorite out of everything were the Surf & Turf Garlic Noodles. It had the bold and nice mix of flavors I was looking for, and the noodles were cooked perfectly, soaking in all of the sauces. (I'd argue that it's hard to mess up stir fried noodles when you're already purchasing restaurant-quality ingredients, but that's for another convo.) All of the dishes were plated nicely and were 'pretty'; however, the flavors/textures missed the mark for me. The server was nice, though.Overall, it was a nice place to try once, but I'm not sure it really makes my 'must try' list of Vietnamese restaurants within the Bay Area.,Very easy to make a same day reservation on Sunday night- 5:45 PM. Came with a few friends after a long day of touring apartments. My favorite has to be the grilled octopus salad and the banh xeo. The lamb shank looked really good but it was a little bit too salty for me. I wisu it had come with rice or something instead of salad to balance it out a little more. The duck eggrolls were pretty standard- i enjoyed them but probably wouldn't order it again. The garlic noodles were really good- the noodles had a good bite and the shrimp was very fresh. It was balanced and easy to eat. Would probably return for it again.,Went here this past Sunday after wanting to try this place for 6 months now.Made a reservation for 5:45 (Dinner) and it was BUSY AF. The waitress was hella helpful and looked exactly like The Waitress from It's Always Sunny, which was a funny coincidence. We didn't know what or how much to order and she was very insightful.My partner and I both ordered the Young Coconut Pina Coladas which was very refreshing and had a gorgeous presentation. App-we shared the duck confit spring rolls. Really tasty by themselves- great crisp to savory filling ratio and the accompanying sauce was sweet and mustardy, well paired combo. App-we also ordered the bone marrow and carpaccio. Bone marrow was great, but could have been roasted a bit longer, carpaccio was good too but between the 2 of us we couldn't finish this plate because it was really heavy.Entree-we got the garlic noodles with chicken. Bit too much pepper, tho the pepper paired well with the noodles. (This dish gave my partner a stomach ache same day, and me as well when i ate it as leftovers the following day).Dessert-we got the creme brulee. It was alright. The cashews on top were a nice touch. The dessert was on a wide shallow dish instead of the traditional creme brulee ramekin which made for a more even distribution of flavor and texture, but it was not torched evenly. Some parts didn't have a nice hard surface while other parts were down right burnt and tasted like it.Good but idk if I'm gonna come back. Was interested in the pho but its 42 dollars with a 14 dollar fee to split on top of that which is excessive. My least favorite part was how dirty the bathroom was, which makes me not interested in coming back at all tbh. Overall the space is hella cramped and it doesn't appear very ADA accessible.

ily with a wheelchair bound person and they were struggling to navigate the restaurant.,We ordered three items and 1 drink. Everything had its own taste.  We'll definitely come back for the food, hospitality and the vibes.,We've gonne to Lily for lunch a while ago and loved it. the dinner offerings on Saturday were stellar. The shaking beef salad is so good, and the chow fun with shrimp was a delight. All of the dishes were exceptional. Tried a couple of the n/a drinks. So good. Will be back. This is high quality food, pasture raised beef, wild shrimp, local organic produce. No cutting corners. I really appreciate this attention to quality. It does come with a higher price but understandable.,We made a last-minute reservation on Friday night to dine at the chefs counter. It was packed when we arrived but we were seated within 5 minutes. The food was flavorful and presented beautifully however I have to give them two stars due to the mild food poisoning my partner and I experienced after the meal. I'm not sure from which dish but we suspect it could be some of the raw ingredients incorporated into the papaya salad or the jackfruit pizza. We observed the chefs later in the evening while cleaning up and closing for the night eating some of raw ingredients straight out of the prep containers with their bare hands. Hopefully just as leftovers but seemed very questionable. Service was otherwise okay. Staff was friendly. The interior was very modern and designed with lots of Asian and Vietnamese elements. For a party of two, our bill came out to be ~$160. Pricey meal better saved for a special occasion if you're interested in trying the place out.,Love supporting high end Asian restaurants, and Lily did not disappoint. The cocktails were great, ambiance excellent, and food was creative and delicious. We particularly loved the Bun Cha!,It was surprisingly easy to make a same-day reservation. We arrived at the restaurant exactly at the timw for our reservation. There was no more distancing as such possibly due to the city lifted mandates. The restaurant was loud which we could barely hear each other. We couldn't decided what to get at first, but thanks to the photos from the Yelp community, we decided for couple appetizers. The jackfruit pizza was delightful, full of micro greens and fruit. It was not heavy but for some reason," quite fulfilling. We also had the duck spring rolls that were packed with duck meat. We had the Vietnamese """"Cioppino"""" and the garlic noodles with beef. The Cioppino was interesting since it had pineapple to make the soup. Big chuck of fish. The broken rice had an interesting texture. We added the beef to the garlic noodles which potentially could be the cause of which it became just the same as a chow main. The texture of thr shaved ice was icy. It will be your cup of tea if you like to """"chew"""" the ice. The overall service was decent.I may not necessary go back for dinner because of how loud this place is and the price point.",Delicious and fresh. Attention to detail from service to food. Will be back to try more. Had the octopus green papaya salad and the special duck confit pastry. Just the tea service alone makes me wanna go there now.,Loved it! Great flavors and ambiance. This place is flavor city! Just the way Vietnamese food is supposed to be. It was just the two of us and we wanted to share almost everything on the menu. We had the the fried whole fish ( a wow factor dish when it comes out and also amazing flavors, be warned come with lots of bones), the bun cha Hanoi (amazing! Still dream about it) and the jackfruit pizza (good flavors but was too much for two people as we only wanted a little slice each otherwise it's too much) I'm still dreaming of all the yummy flavors and can't wait to go back!,Note: The restaurant charges an automatic 20% service fee that is NOT for gratuity. They make this clear on the menu before you order, but we were a bit surprised to see a non-gratuity service fee this high. As for the food, we loved most of what we ordered and the presentation is outstanding (see pics)!For appetizers we tried the Mango Pizza and Wings. These were both super delicious -- definitely don't skip on the mango pizza. For an entree, we split the chow mein with shrimp (you can choose from a variety of meats). This dish was prepared well, but we didn't love the flavor. Overall the menu options were very unique and the food is prepared elegantly. Will definitely be back to try the other options.,The dishes here are so beautiful, and the interior too! It's definitely more on the pricey side, and drinks especially are wild prices ($9 for non alcoholic)? My favorites were the beef salad and roast beef dipping banh mi; the 4 of us split the food family style and paid about $30 each! The bathroom also has a heated bidet :^)Note, they do charge an automatic 20% service fee for all tables!,I'm visiting from New York and we got some high standards for food. My tour guide has said she wanted to try this place so I thought, why not? It'll be both our first time and we'll be surprised by either good food or bad food together right?We called ahead to make sure they had seating for us and they did. When we got there around 6:30PM, most of the tables were occupied and we got seated at the bar, which was great because it fascinates me to be able to watch my food being made in front of me. For appetizers we ordered the carpaccio and the spicy glazed wings. The wings came first. So to preface it, I can't handle spicy but will eat it. The wings are crispy and juicy, and boy was it spicy. I was literally dripping in sweat after the first wing, but it was so good I had to have another. Even the parts not glazed had great flavor itself.The carpaccio is probably my favorite, with the bone marrow. It was extremely flavorful and made me want more after each bite, and it had the dual effect of cooling down the spice from the wings. A win in my book!Our main was the heritage pork. It was actually really flavorful and we thoroughly enjoyed eating.We were also able to chat with the head chef, Robert. Extremely personable and friendly as well as funny. He was joking around with patrons all night and we got in a few jabs with him. He also took the time to explain the concepts for the menu. Overall, the experience was just fantastic!,TL;DR - Immaculate vibes, wonderful plating, good food.As part of my crusade to eat through SF Infatuation's Top 25 list, I made a stop to Lily in the Richmond district. The good news is, Lily is extremely easy to book a reservation for! There's tons of spots at good times, even last minute on a Friday. Now," there are """"outdoor"""" seats", but this is a joke - it's two tables, and if it's not insanely cold or windy, maybe it would be worth sitting outside if you are still hesitant. What we ordered: - Sonoma Liberty Duck Confit Spring Rolls: I think this is a fantastic deal. You get 5 pieces, and it's stuffed with duck! The sauce was delicious, it was a honey mustard but very refreshing. I loved it!- Shaking Filet of Beef Salad: This was fantastic. The salad alone is a meal. You get crispy rice, which isn't my favorite topping for this because much of the salad is soft (crispy rice ended up being too crispy). The salad had lots of avocado pieces and little gem lettuces. The beef was perfect; so soft and juicy, well-seasoned! I highly recommend this one.- Garlic Noodles with Shrimp: I didn't like this... The shrimp was disappointing. If you don't get the salad, get this with beef instead. The garlic noodles were subpar.- Whole Fish: You can get three different sizes based on your party. I got the small version for two people. Now, I have to warn you, if you are with non-Asians, this may freak them out haha. My husband didn't like seeing his fish's head. But as someone who grew up in Vietnam, this was really fun. It was double fried, so you may not get as much meat as you'd like, but still really fun.While everything was extremely presentable and I love that my people are getting the coin they deserve (Vietnamese food should be viewed as worthy of Michelin stars and food critics reviews), Lily just didn't quite hit the marks for me. It was definitely worth a visit to just bask in the ambiance!,Star for service.  O star for over priced food and surprises with a 20% service charge for party of 3Duck egg roll- $15 dry and absolutely don't recommend Garlic noodles with shrimp- $26 just ok Crab soup noodle-$39 not ur typical Vietnamese crab soup noodle- just so so and definitely over priced not worth it.For the above with tax and service charge $101 just for lunch.Will never go back again.Sorry,Lily's came highly recommended, and it was worth trying. The Vietnamese dishes were flavorful, and I discovered foods I've never tried that were so delicious!For appetizers, I ordered the crispy glazed wings and Duck spring rolls. The duck spring rolls were super tasty with an amazing dipping sauce. The wings were crispy and had a spicy glaze, but very flavorful with a sweet blue cheese dipping sauce. Unfortunately, there was a hair in my chicken and the waiter removed it. I didn't get the opportunity to fully dive into the wings like I would have. Main entreés, I ordered the Beef Pho French Dip Bahn Mí sandwich. It was decent, because it was cold. The Beef Pho was cold too, and both should've been hot in my opinion. The star of the show was the Garlic Noodles with Filet Mignon and Shrimp," called """"Surf and Turf"""" on the menu. Topped with edible flowers", filled with flavor, these Garlic Noodles are a must have. Every bite was incredible!Desserts were just ok, I ordered the Coffee Cremé Brûlée and Banana Bread Pudding. No need to go for dessert. I couldn't tell you my waiters name because he didn't introduce himself. Besides the minor setback with the chicken appetizer and the Bahn Mi being cold, the Garlic Noodles would be the reason I would go back for a takeout order.,The calamari appetizer was delicious, so bonus star. The pork chop had great flavor, however was overcooked by a long shot. I wouldn't usually care, but for the price they charge I do. The side of shrimp paste with an egg had the texture of overcooked chunky slimy shrimp.... Not good at all. The service was just okay, they boxed our leftover which was nice. Outside of that there just isn't anything to write home about. Ambience was pretty tight! Literally.... Too tight.. remove a table.,Lily is my top Vietnamese spot in SF! I've had so many excellent meals here. From an elaborate soft-opening tasting menu right before the pandemic (how simple those days now seem) to takeout fare such as elevated banh mi's and pho. I look forward to each dining experience.The restaurant is owned by two sweet sisters Lucy and Lily, and they have the talented and equally sweet Chef Rob creating the menu with his high-end take on classic Vietnamese dishes.One of my favorite dishes is Bun Cha, and the first time I had it at Lily, it literally brought a small tear to my eye. The layering of flavors and the quality of the grilled pork outshone any bun cha I had in Hanoi.The Rice Paper Pizza is also another highlight. Rice paper pizza is a simple street food dish that I first tried in Dalat. Lily's version is visually stunning and  garnished with flowers. The tropical notes of jackfruit are complemented by sambal, pesto, and shallot aioli.For lunch/takeout, they also have a few different unique banh mi's. My favorite is the Pho Bo, which is like a roast beef french dip sandwich with pho broth - so addictively juicy.Lily also hosts occasional special set menus and they have a viral crab/wagyu fried rice that you can reserve in advance on select days.The creative and thoughtful Californian-Vietnamese dishes are a much welcome addition to the SF food scene!,My 2nd time dining here and still the great restaurant I love the consistent taste of their foods!,My wife has been wanting to go here for a while. I think my resistance has been mostly going out to eat in SF lately has been underwhelming. But it was date night and I thought I would surprise her. But I think I surprised myself more.Showed up around 8 for dinner at the chefs counter. It was packed, not uncomfortable but full tables with everyone having a great time and enjoying the food! Every dish we saw as we walked no more than 30ft from the door looked amazing.As we looked down the menu trying to match dishes with what we saw and their descriptions... We immediately went to find drinks. My wife got a glass of wine. I wasn't totally intrigued by the alcohol selection mostly because I have been cutting it out in general. But their non alcoholic section of drinks was amazing! I ended up with the Spicy Mango Sinh To. Very good, lived up to its name and very balanced out with the yogurt. It looked great too! I later on ordered a Lime Sinh To as well. It was fine but more sweet than my liking so I preferred the spicy mango.Ok food; the part I was getting skeptical of originally.After going back and forth about the jackfruit pizza and some pho... We decided. Let's go big, let's see what this is all about.Bun Cha Hanoi and Bo Ne!  Right when we ordered the bun cha, I knew I was setting myself up for failure. I suck at making lettuce wraps, and the little finger sized ones I am even worse at. But it came out and looked even more complicated than I expected. But it was delicious. I didn't epically spill anything but I pretty much had a decent amount of time wiping wasted sauce off my hands. What I did manage to soak up in the noodles and wraps was well seasoned too. Pork was tender and had all the sweet spicy salty and sour tastes. Spot on perfect. It was pretty big too. We shared the dish between the two of us.And then the Bo Ne came out and wow... I did not know how we were going to finish this. My wife and I didn't want to over eat but damn that was too hard to resist. I still don't even know how to describe it, the chef looked at our faces when it came out and said something like y'all ordered the kitchen sink.  It was in my mind a deconstructed bahn mi with a fried egg and scallops... But that doesn't do it justice since the perception of banh mi is too simple. I've had a lot of banh mi from all over Vietnam and this wasn't anything like that. For starters, take the bread loaf. A large, warm, fresh, and soft french roll plated whole and separately so that you could pull it apart and do whatever with. It had a little dish of pate next to it filled with a consomè on top. Just ripping off the bread into that pate mixture was heaven. There was pate, onion, and veggies all over the main plate soaking up everything from the runny egg, beef and spiced sausage. Don't forget the scallops and little fish cakes too. My wife and I were just ripping that bread apart soaking up everything. At the end the plate was pretty much clean. The beef was fantastic too. Although in my mind the star was the pate which I think this plate had more than any human should consume in a night... I regret nothing.After that we wanted dessert but there was no way in hell that was possible. During our massacre of the Bo Ne, my wife had ordered an espresso martini. It looked great but it wasn't just garnished with coffee beans, it had coffee grounds in it and was definitely boozey (ok I know, I said I was trying to cut out alcohol but couldn't resist). So that would have to do for our dessert.The staff also made it. That loud roar of people having good time I mentioned earlier was partly from them. The chef seems like a big personality and kept asking us what we thought of everything and our servers were happy... Not in the fake smile sort of way but the way you get excited when people are enjoying something. It was cool. I would definitely come back again.,Fantastic food and service. Enjoyed all dishes .. jackfruit pizza is a must try as well as the scallop special and noodles,Lily has officially taken over as my favorite restaurant in SF. Anytime I have to go out to a nice meal, I try to convince the group to go to Lily. I have tried most of the menu at this point, and truly nothing disappointed me. Definitely order the jackfruit pizza - it's the perfect appetizer. The black truffle crepe at brunch is also one of my favorite meals!! Lastly, anything they make with tofu is great- I don't know how they get the tofu so crispy and fluffy at the same time, but it's a phenomenal food experience,Service was really good: 9/10 i dont mind 20% tip included. Drinks are good: 8/10Food presentation is good: 8/10Food taste: 1/10 We just can't agree with the marinade. Feel very bad after. TT.TT,Great new place which combines excellent Vietnamese dishes in variations not seen before on Clement Street. Stylish but functional interior with open kitchen directly behind the bar so you can see the chef with the gas powered flaming wok in action. Allmost all gluten-free.,TLDR: Make sure you order the pizza and the fried turmeric fish!! First time having contemporary Viet food! Not gonna lie, I was skeptical. Paying for pricey Viet dishes when my mom makes plenty of bomb Viet food at home? I think I'll pass. BUT after seeing the pretty jackfruit pizza on a friend's Instagram story, I was intrigued and decided to pay a visit.*RESERVATION*We made reservation for 2 the night before and didn't have trouble securing a spot. No outdoor seating as of Dec 2021, so we requested bar seating right in front of the open kitchen. More restaurants need to do this! $25 cancellation fee per person as usual for them fancy restaurants. *FOOD*- Mango jackfruit pizza: first item on the menu/their most popular appetizer. This was so good and refreshing! Love me a creative appetizer! Fruit and cilantro on fried jackfruit banh trang (aka a type of rice paper) -- simple ingredients," but the flavor combo for this """"pizza"""" was *chef kiss*. - Cha Ca La Vong (fried turmeric fish): not exactly how it's made in authentic Viet cuisine", but I actually liked this version better. The fish was battered for crisp, and dill flavor wasn't too strong. Shrimp chips and other components of the dish complemented the fish. My bf has never had something like this before and loved it. Would recommend! Side note: my bf returned for dinner with his friends a few days after and told me he thought the 2 dishes we ordered were the best on the dinner menu lol. They ordered duck confit spring rolls, beef carpaccio, garlic noodles and fried whole fish, all of which was good but not amazing. *DRINK*- lotus green iced tea: we picked the non-alcoholic version. Tea was lightly sweetened. Loved how they use different fresh fruits for the drink. Not bad!*SERVICE/SPACE*- Very efficient. Food came out soon after we order. Servers were friendly and checked in on us time to time. - Space was relatively small and dimly lit. Almost missed it when we walked by. Casual vibes. Overall, my experience was great. Glad I got to check Lily off my list. I'm curious about the banh mi options on their lunch menu, will come back to try those when I get the chance.,EDIT: original review 3/5, updated review 1/52 days later the business owner replies to my review very rudely, trying to discredit my personal opinion of the food quality by researching my past reviews. This review reflected my personal dining experience at Lily, regarding quality, flavor, service, and price point. It's ok to disagree or even defend, but the manner that the owner responded was lewd, unprofessional,  disrespectful, and not welcoming of constructive criticism. I was flabbergasted at the response that I received, as I did have a pleasant dining experience customer service wise. I do not tolerate this type of treatment from any business. I can definitely take my business to another fine establishment that can handle constructive criticism with grace. Why are they so easily offended? Is it because it is true? That baking soda was used to tenderize the meats? It's not a bad thing; it's a cooking hack. The negative was that it tasted like this and the quality/flavor did not reflect the price point," hence why I mentioned it in the first place. I guess my review uncovered something untold. The hostile attack on my """"fine dining"""" experience speaks for itself.Lily is lacking class.-------------------------------------------------------------------------We had dinner reservations at 8:00pm and we were accidentally taken to seating when there wasn't a table open. We ended up just dining at the bar. Typically I only like bar seating for sushi", but bar was a lot quieter and intimate than table seating. It's quite loud in there as well so it's best to sit bar if you plan to have conversation/ are a party of 2.I actually didn't love the flavor of any of the food. The drinks weren't good either.... We got a Ha Long Iced green tea and it tasted like bitter tea lol, and the Green Tea Punch was just alcoholic tasting. Being Vietnamese and being able to enjoy the luxury of homemade Viet food, my standards for this cuisine is quite high. It wasn't bad, but for the price paid I expected A LOT more. The Duck Confit Spring Rolls did not amaze me... The Shaking Beef Filet of Beef Salad was good, but the shaking beef tasted like it was tenderized with a lot of baking soda, due to using low quality meat. It was also greatly lacking flavor! The salad itself was pretty good though, but I have mixed feelings about all the flower petals; while it's pretty it does have a floral taste and there's just too many petals to pick out! What hurt the most was the $42 bowl of Pho! It did not taste like a $42 bowl... it just tasted like pho. It's not like there were any gold flakes to justify the $! I must say, the service was AMAZING. You don't get this type of service at a normal Viet restaurant, so that was refreshing. And I must admit, it was beautiful. I love to eat, but my camera eats first. These dishes were lovely to post! TBH would I come here again? No. I've never spent this much on Viet food for 2 people EVER. $145! But did I enjoy my experience? Yes! FYI there is an auto service charge of 20% included (even for our party of 2). We weren't aware and I'm not sure if it's stated on the menu, but it's visible on the receipt.,My friend and I finally had lunch at Lily.  Blown away by the flavors! We had the surf & turf chow fun, which was excellent. Came with a nice sauce to add to yor liking.  We also had the broken plate kind of sampler dish, which was smart to get for a first timer, or when you just want to taste several delicious items. Prawns were perfect, bbq pork excellent, meatballs delicious.  Pho broth flavorful goodness.The interior design of Lily is quite special, very beautiful.  If you want to try the top of the line in asian flavors, I recommend going to Lily.  I will go again and try some other dishes.  Looking forward to it!  I might like to sit at the counter to watch them cook!,Decided to try Lily on Friday night- the place is pretty small with lots of couples - definitely a date spot. We ordered lots of dishes to share. For each of them the presentation was beautiful:-Green tea punch - tasted like straight vodka/I had to send it backmargarita- didn't think this would be good but it actually was great-Beef salad - my favorite item. Loved the tangy dressing and the steamy chunks of beef-Mango pizza- unique dish with lots of creaminess- good for just a few bites. we wished it was precut/split because the scissors are not practical to use -Garlic noodles with chicken- greasy and one note - hard to eat a lot of this-Whole fish- very good flavors, I really liked to eat with the chunks of pineapple. a bit hard to eat with all of the bones and I thought the noodles were average Overall some novelty dishes but tasted average - not a place I would visit regularly,"Food is pretty good ... it is EXPENSIVE !!!$$!!It's not very authentic Vietnamese food.. but they already know that.  Everything is """"overdone"""" and you pay for it.  I wouldn't recommend this to everyone at the same time I would to some people (with a certain disposable income ) .  Anyways...  try it.",This is a hidden gem, the interior design is beautiful, chic & understated on a unassuming block in the Richmond.We sat at the bar, the wait staff was very attentive and professional. The food was outstanding, the garlic noodles with chicken blew my mind. Cocktails are great and a good wine list..  will definitely be back.,Lily truly delivers.Whenever I have a date with Yelper Anita W., it's always a great time surrounded by amazing food. Her birthday had just passed and I wanted to celebrate by driving out to the City. She had looked through the book marked restaurants and suggested Lily in the Richmond. Sold.She made a reservation for 2, on Sunday, 11/14, for 1:30pm. My hopes were high because 1) she's a foodie that has taken me to some of my favorite restaurants, 2) the reviews from other Yelpers were glowing," and 3) the photos and articles that I read up said amazing things. """"Modern Vietnamese restaurant from Chef Rob Lam... The cuisine merges Northern California sensibilities of sourcing seasonal", local," and sustainable ingredients while staying true to the authentic flavors of Vietnam"""".We ended up ordering way too many food", due to the photos we have seen, the suggestions by Yelpers/the articles we read, and just by the smell and look of the dishes that other patrons ordered. Between the two of us," we ordered the Crispy Rice Paper and Jackfruit """"Pizza"""" ($16)"," which was Anita's favorite appetizer. It had a great mouth feeling from the various textures on this """"pizza"""" and a considerable amount of fresh ingredients. We also ordered the Spicy Glazed Chicken Wings ($17)", which came along with this delicious and not overpowering blue cheese dip. The chicken was full of flavor, crispy and juicy, and quite large with 4 pieces. For our entrees, we split the Beef Pho French Dip Sandwich ($22), the Turmeric Fried Fish Noodle Bowl ($20) and the Garlic Noodles ($16). The beef on the French dip sandwich was perfection. Seasoned and made to perfection. It was quite substantial for a single person, so quite honestly, it was difficult to finish between the two of us. The Turmeric Fried Fish was fantastic. Quite honestly, it was a toss up between this and the Garlic Noodles for me. The noodles had a strong wok-essence (wok hay). I felt it would be fantastic (and I think it's a possibility), to get the Garlic Noodles with a side of Beef from the French Dip and Turmeric Fried Fish from the noodle bowl.The two of us also split a large bowl of Lotus Green Tea Punch Bowl ($48) that came in an actual family sized soup bowl. It was a beautiful presentation of fruits, additional, and flowers that is a delight to look at. The two of us tried, very much in fact, to finish the bowl but was unable to. I believe it is about 8-10 cups of a single serving size of the drink.We both agreed that we loved Lily and plan to come back.Next time, I really want to try a couple of other things we didn't get to order.,Tremendous, original food. Great atmosphere. Wine list. Cocktails. Excellent service. A must-go in San Francisco right now.,I'm honestly surprised by how little I noticed this place on social media. I enjoyed every single dish I ordered and to me, enjoying every single dish at restaurants are extremely rare these days.I love Vietnamese food and a good fusion and I must say this place exceeded my expectations. Everything was so flavorful and presented so beautifully!I ordered:- Fried prawns and sweet potato $26- Vietnamese filet of beef carpaccio $26- Wok seared chow fun $24 with beef +$7- Fried whole fish $MPI definitely want to dine here or order takeout to try more things! It was really busy on a Saturday night but they accepted last minute reservations by phone. Seats and tables were pretty close to each other if you are still nervous about COVID. The counter seats were cool because you can see the chefs cooking!,Was extremely pumped to go here - fancy Vietnamese food? Let me at it.  First issue was they gave away our table after being 10 minutes late to the reservation.  They didn't seem particularly bothered about it until we mentioned that, yes, we were bothered about it.  No biggie, it's about the food, after all.And the food...was really pretty! There were flowers on basically everything, I wasn't sure if they were setting out a decorative bouquet or a plate of food.  It's definitely great for instagram.  For the tastebuds...it was good, honestly.  But nothing particularly exciting.  The jackfruit pizza just tasted like fruit and crackers, kind of one note.  The lamb was really well cooked, but there was no real spice to it.  Nice texture, but honestly I'm having trouble even remembering it because it was pretty unremarkable.I am fully confident there's better Vietnamese in this city.  This place seems to be keyed towards white people taking pictures.,"Probably more of a 3.5 star review. Our group of 4 shared the below items:Banh Trang Nuong Xoai (crispy rice paper and mango """"pizza"""") $16This was one of our fave", the rice paper was nice and crispy and held up under all the toppings and sauces. The shallot aioli + the brightness of the mangos really brought it all together. Pate Choux (duck and gio sausage in puff dough) $24This was a super disappointment. I saw in some old photos that these were served as smaller puff doughs (aka multiple). Ours came as one larger puff, but definitely not large enough or delicious enough to justify $24. Flavors were really underwhelming. Goi Ga Xoai (spicy mango chicken and rice paper salad) $16I really liked the flavors presented in this salad but it was sadly dressed a little too heavily. A little too spicy and sweet. I also wish they presented some other flavors as mango and rice paper were already utilized in the pizza (but we wanted to order another salad on their menu and this was the only other choice). Goi Bo Luc Lac (shaking filet of beef salad) $26This was OK, nothing special. They serve the filet of beef on the side in a pretty small dish and don't recommend mixing it into the salad. Shrug. Bo Kho Hue (Vietnamese braised oxtail stew in the Hue style) $38Hmmm I thought this portion size was SUPER small. The oxtail was tender but didn't taste as rich in terms of flavor. Baguette was also just ok, wish they were warm though. Ca Chien (Fried whole fish) MPThis was another standout, totally recommend. They offered two sizes that night and we ordered the small for the 4 of us. If I remember correctly, it was around $45. This was cooked really well, meat was tender on the inside and outside parts of it were super crispy! It also came with some really QQ noodles which I loved. As for drinks, it looked like beer, wine, and smoothies. Maybe they don't have their liquor license? I had a glass of Riesling which was really nice and lightly sweet :). I'd have to say I felt like their dishes were priced too high for what it was + portion sizes, especially the appetizers. Servers were also not wearing masks the whole time (on their chin sadly). I like the vibe of the restaurant though, really modern and chic!,This restaurant has a nice ambiance and good vietnamese food. The Beef Pho French Dip Bahn Mi Sandwich and Chicken Noodle Soup are delicious. Service was also good the staff are kind and friendly. I had a great time at this restaurant.,Gorgeous and amazing food with excellent service as if you're part of the family. I was super excited to try this place after seeing raving reviews and had to check it out myself. We made reservations for lunch same day for a Saturday and it was super easy on Resy. We were late and got seated counter instead of a table, but didn't mind as we were still able to social distance from the next party over.We first started with the Banh Trang Nguong Mit which is a rice paper jackfruit pizza. This dish was absolutely too gorgeous to eat with the flowers and colors of the topping imprinted on the rice paper. I don't know if it was intentional, but love how they used the nail scissors for cutting this up. It pays homage to how many Vietnamese immigrants came to the Bay Area and started working in the nail business so us kids would have a life here.I'm a big fan of Vietnamese coffee with foaming egg and so glad they had this as most places do not do that here in the Bay. The cream was very foamy and complimented the refreshing fragrant coffee. A nice treat on a surprisingly hot day.Next was my favorite dish and that was the Pho Bo roast beef pho dip sandwhich. The roast beef was decadently tender and melts in the mouth. I was mind blown. The Banh mi bread was toasted perfectly with a crunchy exterior but soft inside that pairs so well with the tender beef. They don't skimp on the beef either as it was stuffed. So massive that I'm glad we shared. Not only was the sandwich good, but the pho soup was excellent. The broth was very flavorful and I'm still dreaming of the lingering smell of it.We also had the Goi Ga, a mango salad salad with rice paper. We had to get our veggies in and that was what this dish was for, but It was surprisingly good too. The chicken was tender and the mango was sweet but firm that added a nice bite to the overall dish.Customer service was attentive and supper friendly. Love how interactive they are with the kids too. I definitely understand the raving reviews about this place because I really can't wait to come back here again!,Great food and a waitress with excellent recommendations for food and cocktails. Went here on the recommendation from a Vietnamese friend and I wasn't disappointed. The waitress had excellent recommendations when I inquired on cocktails, then when ordering food she kept me from over ordering and recommended the fantastic pork chop. If you go, start with the Pho Spice Old Fashioned.  For food definitely duck confit spring rolls and the pork chop. Warning, the pork chop dish includes sausage as well as a shrimp and pork casserole. It could be eaten without any of the two appetizers I had as main entrees.,Stopped by here after an exhibit at the Legion and happy to report that food was generally decent and came at an affordable price point (hint: cost of a cocktail is about the same as most of the entrees). The portions were quite generous as well so we definitely went overboard a bit with the ordering for a group of 4. Out of all of the dishes we've tried, the best was the banh mi french dip and the beef salad. Garlic noodles were a bit disappointing - could have used more garlic and some additional seasoning.,Been dying to try this place and restaurant week offered the perfect deal and excuse to go! Their food is absolutely delicious. This is my first time at a more upscale viet fusion place and it blew my mind away. The restaurant week pre fixe menu was $30 for a drink, appetizer and entree. They also gave complimentary dessert at the end, which was this delicious (I believe) sesame infused creme brûlée. The appetizer I chose was a chicken noodle soup with glass noodles. Was really refreshing and delicious. My partner got the fried duck rolls which he said was really tasty. For the entree, he got a fried fish banh mi while I got the fried fish mixed noodles. Was sooo tasty and I love the infusion of fish sauce into the mix. Not to mention, their portions were huge and we had leftovers to take home. Definitely try this out especially if you're looking for a more upscale Asian food destination.,Ordered the #1 Com Tam Dac Biet and the non-alcoholic strawberry yogurt drink. It was nice to have small portions of different meats (chicken, pork, meatballs, duck spring roll) to experience different flavors and textures in one dish-almost like a sampler plate. The meats were flavorful and juicy. The broth/consommé had a depth of flavor. The plate was a nice portion size. Vietnamese flavors, fancy presentation, higher price point. The drink tasted exactly like drinkable strawberry yogurt.,Lily located busy Clement Street. I was worried about parking but we easily found street parking 2 blocks away. You also can find parking at near parking lot. It is very easy to make reservation via Resy. Lily is offering an upscale dining experience with its food. The inside of restaurant is not big and dimly lit. One row of tables with open kitchen. It also offers Chef's Counter seats. We understand it is not easy to find specious restaurant in SF but I wish the restaurant was bigger and more specious to have upscale dining atmosphere.We had duck confit spring rolls, Jackfruit pizza, Garlic noodles with chicken, Fried whole fish. Jackfruit pizza stands out. It is a very creative dish. It looked very pretty with all flowers and the taste had refreshing flavors.  My husband is very picky with seafood but he loved the Fried whole fish. It was fresh and well cooked. I loved Garlic noodles with chicken. It had good flavor and was big dish. It could be shared with 2 people. My husband loved duck spring roll, but it was too meaty for me. The imperial tea service was very good. The tea was excellent and also came with dry fruit and cute biscuit. The service was good. The water and tea pot filled frequently. Our table checked twice how we felt about the food.,Service was great, but the food is not. Nothing was seasoned and for the price, it's just not worth it.We had the pho and garlic noodles and we couldn't finish either. Atmosphere was cute though.,Worst dining experience ever. My wife and I are shocked and in disbelief at this terrible experience," where the chef calls my wife a """"slant-eyed bitch""""", robs my phone from my hands," and was so belligerent that the police dispatcher told me to get away from him and get somewhere safe. Read on for full review.Food: 2 stars. Nothing to write home about. Very Americanized.We weren't very pleased with the service because we asked if their """"young coconut"""" drink was sweet and contained sugar. The waitress just said """"they make it in the back""""", and gave us the fruit ingredients they put in it, leaving out CONDENSED MILK. So when we got it, it was extremely sweet and we couldn't drink it for more than a couple sips. It was full at the end of the meal, and costed $12.We got the check and decided we wouldn't try to get the item removed from the bill, and would instead just leave a slightly lower tip. I gave my credit card to them without thinking much of it. When I got the bill back, we were discussing leaving a 15% tip when my wife noticed THEY HAD ALREADY FORCED A 20% SERVICE FEE ON TOP OF YOUR WHOLE BILL, and it was not gratuity," just... service fee because it lets them """"pay their staff evenly"""".At this point we weren't happy because we had essentially not touched the item that was miscommunicated to us. We talked to the hostess/manager(?) and let her know about this", and told her the reason we didn't want to leave a 20% tip, and it didn't seem fair that it was forced on us. No one conveyed to us that there would be an additional 20% service fee through this entire process.She said that's the way it is, and I asked to speak with the owner. She got the chef for us, who asked us what was going on. We explained the situation, and he agreed to remove the item from the bill, and went on to say that the service fee lets him pay his staff more evenly," """"because the city is expensive for them to live in""""", he said. Here," I said something when I should have held my tongue: """"the city is expensive for all of us"""". This was a mistake", I should have been more understanding and empathetic.Unfortunately, this set him off in a way I couldn't have imagined. We tried to accept but he never allowed us. He went 0 - 100. My wife started to accept, saying that we appreciate his understanding when he crumpled up the check and told us to go fuck ourselves. We were shocked. We were just paying for our meal and defending what we thought was fair. We tried to say we were just trying to resolve the situation. He was not listening, and started yelling aggressive things and called my wife cunt, bitch, everything you can imagine.I asked him why he's calling her a bitch, and he got IN MY FACE (I don't understand how it escalated to this). His spit was all over me, gross. I remembered I had a phone and pulled it out to record him. And then he robbed me, snatched my phone out of my hands as I was asking him why he called my wife a bitch. I took it back and recorded more, for a few moments he wasn't as belligerent after his colleague held him back, since we had a camera on him. [Restaurant says we yelled at customers. I never spoke to another customer except once to ask if they're seeing it happen. They also never apologized, that's a lie]At this point we wanted to call the police. I finally understood he was not at all trying to solve a dispute, and something had just triggered him into uncontrollable rage. He put his hands on me and physically shoved me out of his store as we were calling the police. I almost ate it.The dispatch officer asked me questions as his maniac continued. As soon as we were outside, WHILE I'M ON THE PHONE WITH THE COPS," he gets up in my face trying to fight. He said: """"oh we're outside now bitch"""" (amazing observation skills!). He called my wife a """"slant-eyed bitch"""" and me a """"pussy-ass bitch"""". Yes", all of this was in front of his other diners. He yelled all sorts of obscenities.The officer hearing this guy saying all the crazy stuff immediately instructs me to get away from this person and get somewhere safe. That should give you an idea of how aggressive and dangerous this person got. The police dispatcher confirmed they have the audio recording of his verbal assault on file, and since we were in the street with lots of people, the officer told me someone is on the way and to stay there. We finally felt safe when the police arrived a few minutes later.Fast forward a few days, my wife is still suffering from insomnia and emotional distress. She's been crying and a total wreck after this shitty experience with the maniac chef. This was supposed to be part of the Valentine's day weekend we enjoyed.Isolated rude incident? Nope: goo.gl/maps/hYJZTKRx2D1y…Were we the only ones who didn't see the hidden fee? Nope: yelp.com/biz/lily-san-fr…If you believe in having civil conversations, avoid this place, and please share this,That is the worst restaurant experience I had in my life. Assault, racist and discrimination!!! Ironically and sadly," the first time I got discriminated in a U.S. restaurant by an asian by calling me """"SLANTED EYE BITCH"""" because i questioned about the 20% hidden service fee! I cannot believe the guy who was extremely flirting with white customers was extremely rude to us after my husband questioned about the 20% hidden service fee. He screamed me """" fucking bitch"," get out of here."""" I was shocked and could not believed what just happened. I started to record the video"," he continued screaming """" SLANTED EYE BITCH""""! Sadly and ironically from an Aasian!!We ended up calling police. But the 15 min assaulting memory has traumatized me and I got mentally hurt.  The past two days"," the memory of he calling me """" fucking slanted eye bitch"""" and trying to push me has haunted me. I could not go sleep well. And I cried three times because of it. I could not talk about this until today. When I am wring this", but heart is still pounding.------------PS: I saw the owner twisted the fact in her response ( which was later DELETED after I clarified here). 1. there was no apology from the restaurant from the beginning to the end. 2. They didn't offer 20% hidden fee refund. He did say remove $12 wrong coconut drink at beginning but immediately changed his words after he suddenly act like a monster. The reason why he agreed at first place is because they gave me wrong drink. there are a lot of sugar in it but I specifically told waitress to not put any sugar at the beginning.3. We never rejected the removal of coconut drink offer. But after my husband questioned about the 20% charge," the chef was suddenly and dramatically irritated and cursed me """" bitch"""" and stated """" no more removal of the coconut drink. You bitch get out of here!""""4. I did make a mistake of not leaving immediately but calling police inside of the restaurant. I was so shocked and didn't know what to do but calling police. But I didn't do anything harmful during the time inside the restaurant. This became the reason why police could not put him in jail at the end since he used i was not leaving the place immediately as an excuse to justify the behavior of assaulting me. I learned lesson from the real life.5. The incident happened on 2/12 lunch time. Both we and the police have all recording of how he was extremely rude and being a racist!!  Police even told my husband to get away from chef on the call since they heard all the threatening words from the chef.@ly we both are asian women. Could you please put yourself in my shoes? If one day you or your loved one go to a service place and questioned a fee you don't think is reasonable", and then you get assaulted," being called """"fucking slanted eyed bitch"," get out of here"""" and got physical threats", how do you feel? We are both women. I don't know if you have kids but just think one day it happens to your daughter, how would you feel? Do you think that is the country you considered safe and being respected as home?I really think I deserve an apology from you and chef Rob Lam.-------------Rob lam post his final statement in IG ( see the attached). He admitted he was racially assaulting me, and he rejected apologizing.Additional clarification to your statement:1. We didn't see the 20% charge until we asked Rob why 20% is charged. It is on the last page button which is designed to intentionally make it hard to see. We went to another restaurant after this. They also requested 20% but waiter explicitly told us before giving us the check.2. From the beginning to the end, we never refused to pay tips. We just don't think food and services are good for 20%Again, not happy with us disputing the service is not the reason of being a RACIST. That is the worst excuse to justify being a racist is reasonable.Rob, by gathering all information, I wonder you probably have been treated with racism when you grow up. That sounds like one reason that you think yelling racial slur to a customer is acceptable. If that is the case,  you are a real victim to racial discrimination. We can't perpetuate that behavior. WE HAVE TO STOP RACSIM. I do highly recommend talking to a therapist for your uncontrollable emotional issue ASAP. I am not the first victim but I hope I would be the last one. I really don't want more customers to experience what I have experienced in the future.,You have to try Lily on clement. Whether you love SF-traditional-Vietnamese or you are new to the game, Lily is a MUST because you'll taste the passion for Vietnamese cuisine in every bite from the head chef, Rob Lam. Chef Rob Lam has been inviting people from the Bay Area to the dining table for a MINUTE with restaurants like Perle in Oakland and Butterfly in San Francisco. To me, his expertise lies in paying homage to traditional flavors and techniques from Vietnam, Thailand, China, Japan and Korea while also paving his own culinary path. He is also a personal inspiration of mine alongside Chef David Chang, Chef Duminda, and Chef Morimoto. What's so special about Lily to me, is what Chef Rob brings to the menu. A mixture of humbly delicious and the spectacularly divine! A carefully curated bone broth, steaming with heritage, yet topped with gold flakes.  Haha you have to try it yourself to see what I mean.I recommend getting:Bo Tai Chanh: Raosted Bone Marrow, and Vietnamese Micro herbs, picked shallots, finger limes with a seasame cracker and Filet Beef Carpaccio (gluten free) $22Pate Choux: duck and gio sausage in puff dough $24 Pho Bo #2 : Filet and Banana Shank, Oxtail, bone marrow, Broad Pho Noodles, and Pho consomme $32For dessert, as recommended by Chef Rob LamPlease get the Bread Pudding, moist with a surprisingly savory and salty taste and the Crème Brûlée, thin layer of vanilla cream with a true burnt crust! Which the chef will tell you is the way it's suppose to be served, BURNT! HahaAlso, please be on the lookout as Chef Rob Lam tends to make appearances and YOU WILL WANT TO TALK TO HIM. There is nothing greater than talking to the mastermind behind the dish! We were lucky to run into Chef Rob Lam while we were there and we were grinning from ear-to-ear! Create food memories,Isabelle Pinard,Made reservations for a group of 6 on a Friday to dine here and had an incredible experience! Packed house on a Friday evening so would definitely book a table if you want to eat here on the weekend. Drinks: Preserved Lime Soju cocktail - really tasty on the creamy and sweet side but so delicious slightly savory fermented lime throughoutPina Colada Soju Cocktail - comes in a fresh coconut,  sweet and tropical Strawberry Daiquiri - bubble and berry forward definitely on the sweet side but overall goodFood: Jackfruit Pizza - fantastic presentation, a thin crisp rice paper cracker topped with jackfruit pieces, fresh herbs and various sauces. Great light appetizer to start off the mealPate Choux with Duck and Sausage - very comforting, flaky puff pastry wrapped around a meat filling served with a hoisin sauce. Beef carpaccio with bone marrow - delicious, so flavorful and the combination of raw beef with bone was unique and surprising. Everyone got to fun create their own bite with the sesame crackersVegetarian chow fun - comes with a sauce that you pour tableside, one of the favorite dishes of the night! Really savory, loaded with vegetables and fried tofu, liked the twist with using rice rolls instead of loose noodlesTumeric Fried Fish - crispy fried pieces of fish dressed with dill and sauteed onions served with rice noodles, herbs, lettuce, shrimp sauce and shrimp crackers. Build yourself a loaded lettuce wrap to get all the flavors in one bite! Highly recommend this one as well.Vegetables Curry - mild yellow curry with lots of different veggies. This was good but compared to the other dishes didn't quite stand outService: Really great recommendations from our server, overall pretty attentive, and Chef Lam even walked us through how he eats his Cha Ca La VongCan't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu.,I'm hesitant to write this review because I selfishly don't want people to realize how amazing this restaurant is. I've been here for dinner 5+ times, and I'm always excited to come back. The decor inside is amazing; vibe is impeccable. The owner is very cool and makes you feel like family when you walk in through the door. Lily is exactly what Clement St. needed!The portions are generous and my must-order items are: beef carpaccio and chow fun with steak.Seems like they recently got their liquor license, which is amazing! Cocktail prices are on the high side, but nothing abnormal for SF.I am a Lily stan!,I walked in for a lunch takeout. Ordering was easy and staff were helpful for vegetarian suggestions and what would be easy to eat in the car while driving. The attention to details and small gestures to make my lunch top notch was incredible. Fish sandwich - the red chili pepper slices look intimidating, don't be scared. Take a big bite and enjoy the flavors. This is a cross of a po' boy and banh mi, IMO. Salad - I asked for it without chicken. There were rice paper strips on top so some special preparation is needed. You need to mix the dressing on the salad to soften the paper. Bright and fresh flavors makes this salad my new favorite. I'll be back!,Lily is a Vietnamese fusion restaurant on Clement street in Inner Richmond. If you're looking for traditional cuisine, this isn't it. But if you're looking for aesthetically pleasing Vietnamese food with a modern twist, and willing to pay a premium, Lily is worth checking out. Service was fairly attentive given how busy it was on a Sunday night (and we loved their cute dog!).Favorites at our family table tonight were the pork chop as well as the fried fish wraps. My personal favorites were the crab noodle soup and the vegetarian garlic noodles. All the plates were bursting in flavor, they've really perfected their sauces and broths.Preserved lime daiquiri- beautiful presentation and refreshing flavor.Salt and pepper Calamari- nice twist on fried calamari, enjoy the spicy sauce, pineapple is interesting contrast of sweetness with the spicy sauce. The calamari itself came out room temperature and not quite as fresh as we would have liked. Felt like there was more batter than actual calamari. Liberty Duck rolls- healthy portion of duck, flavor itself was okay but we enjoyed the honey mustard dipping sauce with these.Crab noodle soup- love the tomato crab flavor in the broth.Garlic noodle- noodle texture was not over cooked like we've had at other places lately. Enjoyed the flavors and ingredients of this dish.Fried fish with small rice noodles and lettuce wraps- the fried fish on its own is quite tasty, having it in a lettuce wrap elevates the dish, giving a nice lettuce crunch contrast to the fried fish's crispy soft texture.Grilled pork chop bone in with steam egg, pork sausage and broken rice in soup- pouring the rice and broth over the pork really made this quite a yummy comfort food.,I came across this restaurant when looking for a dinner option on Yelp around the area given the positive reviews and it didn't disappoint! My friend and I were able to find street parking in the area right across the restaurant on a Thursday evening (around 6pm) without any issues. When we arrived, the restaurant only had 2-3 parties in it, but they only had bar seating and a table that needs to be given back at 7:30pm. This place is fairly popular so I would recommend making a reservation on Resy if you can.Food - We ended up ordering the shaking beef salad, pate choux, and the braised oxtail stew for the two of us. All the dishes were great and I especially enjoyed the shaking beef salad and the oxtail stew. The pate choux was really good too, but it's definitely on the heavier side. I feel like this is a dish I would prefer to share with at least 3 other people. The oxtail stew was super flavorful and the meat just came right off the bones. I didn't care much for the bread (a bit hard for me) but enjoyed it with the rice. Drinks -  I ordered a Lotus Green tea punch (lemongrass, lychee and goji berry ice, fruits and giggles) since it sounded really good with all the fruit flavors, but I was a bit disappointed by it when I tasted it. Even after stirring, the flavors are really subtle and almost close to flavorless. I didn't get much of the flavors described from the drink and only just the alcohol taste. I would not recommend this drink personally. The atmosphere was really nice and definitely great for a date or just good times with friends. I enjoyed all the presentation of the food as well and love all the flowers they add to the decorations. Staff were friendly as well. Overall a great place to check out!,Been dying to try Lily and finally snagged a bar counter reservation for Saturday night. Highly recommend the bar counter - you get a direct view into the kitchen which is sweet. The restaurant is super cute, parking can be a pain but we got lucky and found a spot quickly. They have holiday decorations that were super adorable. I didn't catch our waiters name (curly hair, right arm tattoo) but he was amazing! The service was excellent, his recommendations were great and overall added to the dinner. The food! The duck confit egg rolls were amazing and the shrimp/sweet potato fritters were my absolute favorite of the night. The shrimp/sweet potato came with lettuce wrap, chili sauce, and some veggies - make sure to make a wrap with all the ingredients (I left the head out so I didn't get any pointy pieces). For entree we got the Pho Bo (they were out of the duck noodle soup) and the pork chop. We definitely did not need to order both. The pho was delicious and came with so many cuts of meat. The pork chop was amazing, perfectly cooked and the flavor was electric. It came with a shrimp/pork meatloaf that was super interesting, but not my favorite personally. The broken rice that accompanied it was delicious.We were celebrating so we got the banana pudding which was a warm bread pudding with miso caramel and a banana with a flambe like sugar crust - HOLY SHIT WAS THIS GOOD! Definitely will be back but will pare down the ordering as we left with a lot of leftovers.,I came here on a lunch date after seeing the beautiful & unique dishes on Lily's menu on social media. We walked in on a weekend and were able to get seating after around a 10-15 minute wait.We tried:Duck Confit spring rolls - super flavorful and the meat was really rich, definitely recommend.Mango chicken rice paper salad - probably my favorite out of the items we tried. The concept was super unique, and the ingredients were so fresh.Pho Bo (roast beef pho dip sandwich) - this was the one I was most excited about but personally not my favorite. The pho broth & sandwich separately were good, but I felt like dipping the sandwich in the broth didn't add much to either dish. We did let the dish cool down a bit before eating it though. I'd say it's still worth a try.Vietnamese egg coffee - this comes with salted egg yolk foam and we both loved it.Strawberry sinh to - a strawberry yogurt drink (we ordered the alcoholic version) that we both really enjoyed as well. It's super pretty and tastes great too :)Overall my bf and I had an awesome experience here; the service was great, we loved most of our dishes, and the chef is super friendly & has great energy. I will definitely be coming back to try the uni fried rice!!,Let's get right to itService 5/5:  Enthusiastic owner, nice staff. Nothing to complain about service Drinks 5/5 Both the drinks I ordered was really good. It wasn't too sour because of the yogurt and the pina colada has shaved coconut pieces. So yummmmy . Food 3/5The hits were the calamari and the beef carpaccio. That bone marrow in the beef carpaccio tasted so good with the beef. It enriches it. The salt and pepper calamari was unique and interesting. I like how there was sauce and pineapple and cucumber but it didn't make the calamari soggy at all.  So why the 3/5? The duck noodle soup was just ok, soup was good and the duck is very perfectly tender, the noodles were very soggy though, all in all it was kind of bland. Their famous beef pho is way better.  The most disappointing was the pork chop, it was cooked perfectly but it wasn't juicy and it was so so salty to the point that me and my friend couldn't eat it as it. We both had some bites and it was just too salty. They prob marinated for too long or something . Had to take off a star because they were entree items.  All in all this place is pricey but that's ok some items were delicious. I would come back again prob to try new items on the menu, they update it regularly. This is my second time here. So prob will still be back. Also beware of the restroom, it has a step I twisted my ankle coming out of the restroom. The decor of it is nice though.,One of the best and most creative dining experiences I've had in SF. My partner and I have gone twice - once was for their Valentines Day special menu. Every meal blew us away: vibrant and fresh ingredients, innovative dishes, amazing attention to detail, flavorful, and bomb drinks. Roast beef Pho French Dip bahn mi - FIRE. Huge amount of meat in the sandwich with a side of really yummy pho for dipping. #1 Vietnamese BBQ Broken Rice plate - Sooo good, almost like a sampler with a variety of different meats. Duck spring rolls were my fave; the pork BBQ skewers are a little dry but great flavor.And the valentines day menu was so impressive!!! Everything was excellent!!!I do have to say, we were at the restaurant during the incident on Feb 13th 2022 when a customer reported being called a racial slur by the owner. I don't know exactly what happened but it does concern me. We left abruptly after the altercation took place to avoid having to interact with the police.,Want to impress an ABG?Take her to Lily!Gorgeous, photogenic dishes crafted with high-quality ingredients.Baller fried rice adorned with imperial wagyu, hokkaido uni, ikura, soft shell crab, and black truffle.I legit tried to do a scratch and sniff on my phone screen because I'm too cheap to pay $93 for it.Seriously though, Lily serves some of the prettiest Vietnamese dishes I've seen and will have your date very happy with the photo ops.However, as someone who loves Vietnamese food and will regularly drive to Man Jose for it, I was sorely disappointed in the muted flavors.I know, I know Lily is a Modern Vietnamese restaurant doing spins on the classics but I read in several articles that they were going for authentic flavors. IMO, it was missing the quintessential nuances of salty, sour, bitter, spicy, and sweet that makes Vietnamese food so delicious. BUT everyone has different tastes (or maybe it was a really off night). By the time we left Lily, it was very busy so I'm obviously in the minority here.First things, first. Def make reservations on Tock. If you're not ready to dine indoors, call/email to request a table outdoors (2 sidewalk tables). No heat lamps so dress warm.With restrictions fully lifted, masks are not required. Staff doesn't wear them. Indoor dining seems to be running close to full capacity.F O O D* Bò Tái Chanh: Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio w/ five-spiced bone marrow, herbs, pickled shallots," """"sesame"""" rice crackers ($22): bit.ly/3h4DHIbBeef on beef? YAS! Love the creative spin with the addition of roasted bone marrow. The carpaccio was soft and well-marbled with a citrusy herbacousness. It was the most flavorful dish of the night.Unfortunately", the rice crackers were on the stale side and the bone marrow was overcooked so only the center had rich, unctuous marrow.* Cơm Tấm Sườn Tom Nướng: BBQ Berkshire Pork Chop Broken Rice w/ lap xuong sausage, green tomato cabbage stir-fry, shrimp+pork meatloaf ($38): bit.ly/3h1FcHgLooked fantastic but the main event was underwhelming.My favorite part of the dish was the Chinese sausage and crisp cabbage stir-fry, followed by the savory meatloaf topped with a vibrant golden yolk. The pork chop had a beautifully seared, caramelized crust but it was well-done so not as tender as it could be for a thiccc cut (I asked about a medium temperature). Not sure if it was supposed to have lemongrass flavor like the classic sườn nướng but it didn't. It really needed nước chấm for oomph; there was none. One of the best things about broken rice is the unique texture and nutty flavor. So, I was sad to see it served inside a bowl of broth; it was more like a deconstructed porridge.* Chả Cá Thăng Long: Classic Turmeric Fried Fish w/ banh hoi rice noodles, fermented shrimp+pineapple sauce, shrimp chips ($28): bit.ly/3duIQaeI was really excited for this dish because it's hard to find in SF. Make your own lettuce wraps with the fried fish, banh hoi (woven rice noodles), shrimp chips, and herbs.The fried fish was flaky and moist but the batter was thicker than the norm and extra crunchy like fried chicken tenders. The dill garnish was fragrant but the fish itself didn't have much flavor. Def needed to drizzle the fermented shrimp+pineapple sauce over. I like that it wasn't overly salty. S E R V I C ERocky start due to the lack of communication from the staff that sat us. Once our server arrived, things improved. He was great; friendly, upbeat, and accommodating. Trying to avoid sugary cocktails, he was able to find plain soju for me which I appreciated.Despite being the only table there, our food did take some time, as takeout orders seem to take priority. Plan for a leisurely meal, relax with some alkie, and you're good!A M B I A N C EClassy and ornate with modern touches. Open kitchen with counter seating. Great for date night.P A R K I N GStreet parking only which can be difficult. Try looking for parking towards California.Overall, love the concept and presentation but the food was underwhelming given the hype. But, my friend liked it so Lily is a place you have to try for yourself and decide.,Always a great time at Lily with yummy food! Last week we got a surprise gigantic fried fish just for the two of us haha. It was very meaty and loved all the fixings that came ugh it to wrap the fish in to eat,I'm Vietnamese so I could be biased, but this is one of the most disappointing Vietnamese meals I have ever had in my life. Not only were all of the dishes unappetizing, but it's extremely hard to enjoy your meal when you hear staff laughing and talking about their weekends instead of serving you. Everything is extremely overpriced for what Vietnamese food should illustrate. Honestly, a very poor representation of our cuisine and I hope people stop overpaying for pho. We ordered the bone marrow pho as well as a very forgettable fish dish.,I would give it 8 stars if I could. If you're coming to Lily, you're coming for elevated modern Vietnamese food to impress the people you're with. I love taking people here and watching their faces as they try the jackfruit pizza. The decor is beautiful and it creates an amazing ambiance. The waiters are nice and attentive and Chef Rob always makes sure to check in at every table and give us a quick rundown of the dish we ordered. The portions, flavors, and ideas behind the dishes are all great. I would recommend getting the jackfruit pizza and beef carpaccio for appetizers because those are legit 10/10. For the entrees I'd recommend the chow fun and the rice plate!,Amazing food such great experience and amazing service. Well worth the money and we can't wait to go back! Food was hot and delicious tasted so authentic but had the Asian fusion flair. Beautiful presentation,Lily has been in my bookmarks for a while and my friend and I finally decided to go last Friday for dinner. My friend made reservations for 8pm and I'm glad she did cause it was almost a full house when we arrived. We were greeted by a friendly host and a cute little dog! :) We ordered the following: -(5/5) Sonoma Liberty Duck Confit Spring Rolls: These are a must get!!! The duck confit filling was heavenly! -(5/5) Fried Prawns and Sweet Potato: They serve the fried prawn heads as well which I loved! I know it's not for all haha. Sweet potato had two variations of purple and gold. Yumm! -(4/5) Garlic Noodles w/Chicken: Above average garlic noodles, but I've definitely had better. -(3/5) Perigord Black Truffle Crepe: Our least favorite of the night, unfortunately. They used some sort of coloring to make the crepe color black. It had a burnt smoky taste to it and much much crispier than I normally have it. The filling was good minus the shaved truffles that were overpowering! (I know! Who complains about  shaved truffles?! lol). If you are a truffle lover, I suggest trying this dish! -Spicy Mango Sinh To (Non-alcoholic - I got this) : Delicious!!! The yogurt they use to make this drink is absolutely to die for!-Strawberry Daiquiri (Alcoholic - friend got this) : Again- the yogurt!! Hardly can taste any alcohol, it's dangerous haha. Though the last two dishes were not my fav, I am giving this place 5 stars for the freshness of the ingredients, fantastic service, and creativity of the dishes, but still staying authentic! My friend also does not eat red meat so I want to come back to try the red meat and fish dishes next time. Additionally, they offered a lot of non-alcoholic beverage options which I loved as a non-drinker. Even the cocktails they have are very unique! Will definitely be returning! :),A nice twist on your classic Vietnamese cuisine. Food was very good and great service and conversation with the chef himself. The chef also gave us larger portions and a free Viet iced coffee!  amazing service and food,Ugh, the place is stunning and elegant. There was a beautiful large traditional Chinese medicine cabinet that made the place feel so cozy. The service was friendly and the food was absolutely delicious. The French influences are quite present but the flavors are unequivocally Vietnamese.,"Easy reservations. Food is overpriced for sure for Vietnamese fusion . Oxtail dish was good but the rest I wasn't at all impressed . One of my friends drink was overly sweet so she asked for another one and the male waiter had a horrible attitude . He's probably like I get the 20%gratuity anyways . I'm all about supporting my Vietnamese community but not when business is ran like this. What's worse is the person in the front overcharged my card . It was suppose to be split between two cards . But I got charged full amount and my friend got charged for half the amount . I called to express my concerns and the girl said """"oh I remember you """" your card tap so it was charged . It happens . Miss girl you didn't care to tell me that the day of ? So now I've been calling and no response on getting my refund. Def not coming back again .",This place is so good! You can make reservations easily on tock.com. They have 2 tables for outdoor seating. Since we had 2 furbabies come to lunch with us, I had to call to reserve because there is no option on tock to do so. The hostess was really friendly! For 4 people we ordered the duck spring rolls, shaking beef salad, pho bo, and broken rice plate. The duck spring rolls were good, and the sauce was a chinese mustard sauce!  The shaking beef salad- my favorite dish! I just wish it had a bit more beef. Pho bo- such an interesting concept- a banh mi that you dip into soup, it was very tasty! Broken rice plate - they gave a lot of meat, can definitely shareThe food is really tasty and also so aesthetically pleasing to the eye! The dishes are a bit pricier than traditional Vietnamese restaurants, but I do think it's worth it!,We got their spring rolls and garlic noodles and they were both so delicious. But the best part was their cocktails. We got their lime daiquiri and I've never had a daiquiri like that. It was actually a frozen cocktail and had a Vietnamese twist to it. I could have at least 2 of these in one sitting! Interior and decor of the place is artistic and cozy too. Definitely will come back.,I don't normally go out to eat Vietnamese food - it never quite compares to my mom's home cooking... but Lily went above and beyond expectations!FLAVOR (4.5/5):1. Lotus Green Tea Punch (Alcohol-Free): We started out with the punch and at first I didn't enjoy the floral taste, but it quickly grew on me throughout the meal. The punch comes with lychee, oranges," and other fruits which balance out the flavor of the tea. 2. Crispy Rice Paper and Mango """"Pizza"""": At first I was hesitant about the mango pizza", but all my doubts went away when I took my first bite. Wow... it was the perfect balance of sweet and savory. For most people in my party, it was their favorite. A must-get!3. Sonoma Liberty Duck Confit Egg Rolls: I enjoyed the egg rolls - the influence of French cuisine was apparent. Paired with the sauce, it was delicious. But if you're not into gamey flavor profiles, then this dish is not for you. 4. 2nd Place Pho Bo Bowl: Wow... this dish really reminded me of home. They cook the broth for 72 hours and it was incredibly flavorful, even without the plum sauce they provide. It's the best pho I've had outside of home (maybe even better than home... but don't tell my mom). The meat was incredibly tender and melted in my mouth...5. Wok Seared Vegetarian Chow Fun: The chow fun was amazing as well! The noodles are presented as chewy rolls, which I thought was an interesting take on the dish. The tofu paired well with the chow fun and made the dish not too heavy. 6. Fried Whole Fish: Again... wow... The fish was nice and crispy... and the sauce was paired with pineapples! The pineapples with the fish reminded me of a soup dish my mom prepares that I cannot find anywhere else. It was a pleasant surprise and only added to the authenticity of the dish. 7. Banana Pudding: The banana pudding was good! The pudding and the ice cream melted in my mouth. The only note I would give is that it's a little too sweet. 8. Rainbow Che: In my opinion, the che was the odd one out. The ratio of ice to che was too much and I wanted there to be a little more liquid similar to the drinks you get at Bambu. Once the ice melted, it improved the texture, but ideally, I wouldn't want to wait for it to melt. I'm also not sure the flavor of the che appealed to me. SERVICE (5/5):Our server was Caleb and he was amazing. We were pretty indecisive about what to get, but he helped us pick the best dishes. The timing of our dishes was also perfect and I cannot stress this enough... it's rare for service to go this smoothly (in my experience) and it made for a pleasant time. AMBIENCE (5/5):The interior is beautifully decorated and the place was busy on a Thursday night. Definitely a date spot, but if you want to try lots of dishes then bringing a group is good too! Just make reservations in advance. TAKEAWAYS:Wow... I can confidently say that this is the first Vietnamese restaurant I'd want to come back to... Lily operates on a high level and at a great price point. The food is Vietnamese with a twist - it perfectly captures the authenticity of Vietnamese cuisine while offering something new and unique. This might be my new favorite restaurant in SF.,This restaurant is one of those restaurants you'd probably see on a Worth It episode as they try fried rice at drastically difference prices. Lily's fried rice would be the most expensive one, with gold flakes, uni, wagyu, and crab. If you ever want to flex in front of a date, take them here and order the soft shell crab add-on too. She'll have dollar signs in her eyes.What we ordered:Banh Trang Nuong Mit - 5/5. This was a creative dish, and I really liked the flavors. It was super fresh, and the jackfruit is fleshy and banana-like. You get scissors to cut the rice cracker into slices.  Com Chien Cua - 3/5. Aforementioned bougie fried rice, with soft shell crab add-on. This dish alone was almost $100. It looks impressive, but flavors-wise, it was just salty. The fancy flavors are definitely wasted if you just mix them in; they'll get overpowered by the salt. I'd recommend picking off the uni and wagyu and just eating them on their own before starting on the rice.Ca Chien fried whole fish (MP, was $40 that day) - 4/5. This fish was pretty small for it to be $40. It was good though, with a thin crisp layer of skin. I tried to eat every bit of it to get my money's worth. I really liked the stir-fried rice noodles underneath the fish... possibly more than the fish itself.I also tried the Vietnamese coffee. It is very thick and rich. Probably 50% condensed milk or more. Did not really taste salted egg in the foam. This was a very expensive dinner. I'm not sure how authentic it was, but it is definitely Vietnamese food elevated. Now, back to the $10 bowls of pho...,I'm boggled by the reviews here. This place is way over priced for pretty food that fails all around on Vietnamese flavors and quality of ingredients. The service is wonderful however.Much of the food struggles for identity. Sticky shrimp paste glazed wings are tasty...but loses it with blue cheese style sauce they're served with. Duck egg rolls served with mustard doesn't pair. Shrimps fried in their shells 'for flavor' doesn't work when you used days old poor quality frozen farmed shrimp. The preserved lime cocktail is great, but the lotus punch tastes medicinal. Skip this and go to one of the many Viet places in Richmond/Sunset with real flavors and traditional dishes,One of the best dining experiences I've ever had- excellent venue, customer service, and amazing food.  For apps we had calamari, duck confit spring rolls, and chicken wings- and all of it was delicious.  The chicken wings are not the tiny wings- but big thick wings.  The sauces for each of the apps were interchangeable and delicious.  The aioli with the chicken wings- bottle it up and I will eat it with everything.  We also got an extra side of house made hot sauce that's amazing- spicy with so much flavor! Then we were there early enough to sneak in a French dip bahn mi- wow - I will go back to have this for lunch.  So much flavor- that's the ongoing theme- everything has unique and amazing flavor. As if we had space for more - we had the Bun Cha Hanoi BBQ- the broth .... wow ... again- so rich in flavor.   I'm glad we couldn't finish it because I got to bring it home and eat it again!! Cha cha la vong- I'm not a huge fish person- but the smell of the dill alone made me have to try it- again- lots of great flavor.You literally cannot stop eating bc the flavor is so amazing.  We didn't have space in our stomachs but obviously we went for dessert - hot chocolate pot de creme- WOW- I'm sad I couldn't eat more - the chocolate so rich and creamy, the touch of sea salt- to die for.  And the creme brûlée with little stars and so CRISPY!  Had a pina colada which wasn't heavy at all- it was tasty.  And they have a great wine menu as well.The staff were friendly and attentive- even as it got busy- the chef came out to all the tables.  Seriously - best dinner, service, food experience I've had in a very long time and one of the best of my life.  I am so going back because I want to try everything!!!,"Excellent high end Vietnamese food. Tasty and delicious. Friendly and wonderful service."""
Beit Rima,"Beit Rima e provided a cozy and welcoming vibe the moment you step into the restaurant! The restaurant is open seating, so you have the choice of picking the table of your preference. You place all your food orders at the register and wait for the server to deliver your food to the table. We ordered the batata harra and the chicken shish tawook plate, and both dishes were phenomenal! The potato's in the batata harra were covered in cilantro and spices and were soft in the middle with a slightly crispy skin. It was a nice dish to share amongst a party of two! The chicken shish tawook plate came with 3 chicken skewers, a serving of hummus, two pieces of pita bread, and some assorted pickled vegetables on a bed of rice. The chicken was so tender and juicy with great flavors! The servers were all extremely friendly and we felt welcomed the moment we entered the restaurant! Would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for fresh Arabic food in Cole Valley.,This is our first time here and the staff was very friendly. Restaurant is clean and organized. The baba ghanoush is excellent and so is the mint tea. Five stars all around and a very nice addition to the neighborhood. Mezze sampler - 5/5Mint tea - 5/5Samir's bread - 5/5,Came here for dinner on a Sun evening and the food was good, but how they charged was what left a bad taste. My experience: I ordered food at the counter and when they turned the POS system to me for tip selection, I clicked '18%' thinking it's calculated off of the pre-tax subtotal and also aware of the 5% SF mandate fee. Later, upon looking at the grand total on the receipt I realized that they had calculated 18% from the cumulative total of subtotal + sales tax + SF mandate fee. Since when is a tip calculated off of taxes AND fees? I'm all for supporting local businesses and appropriately tipping workers even if it's over-the-counter service, but when I'm dealt with an unexpected charge like this, the restaurant appears dishonest to me.,We have recommended Beit Rima as our favorite Mediterranean restaurant in SF since before the pandemic. So this incident was disappointing. We had family visiting and I ordered several items from their website. Since the hand bread was not available at Church st, I decided to gamble and order from Carl St: Couple Mezze sampler, Beef Kabob Plate, Chicken Shishtawook Plate, Hand Breads, Ful and the incredible Batata Harra.Pickup was a pain since it involved driving an additional 15 minutes, but the food is worth it. Long story short, the person picking up returns home and we find the Batara Hara missing. Bummer since I had talked it up to the visiting family, but it happens when the kitchen is busy. What was unexpected was getting a refund is a pain.I shot off an email to the 2 emails which confirmed the order with images, and then to another email suggested on the website, however after over a week no response! The food is stellar, but the quantity isn't as generous as it used to be. While the prices are up as much as 20-25%. Inflation sucks.  Not sure if Samir is aware that the Carl st crew may be running thin that they struggle to process a refund for missing items, or that items are missing in the first place. Bottomline, I will not order from Carl st again, and stick to Church st, and since the prices are a little crazy, save the orders for really special occasions.,Delicious! Got the hummus with pine nuts and spiced beef along with the hand kneaded bread. Wanted to try the baked halloumi as well but they were out of stock. But a bowl of hummus and bread is all you need to get filled up. Their gussied up hummus was good but the star was definitely the bread. It doesn't look all that impressive but upon biting into it,  you'll know how expertly made it is. It sits on a drizzle of olive oil but the chewiness, softness,  and crispness of the puffy dough will have you craving more to eat with your meal. If I could get my pizza crusts to taste like that I'd be happy. Will be back.,I always get the Chicken Shish Tawook. Ask for extra toum, that's the garlic sauce. Shout out to Cherylynn as I read her review, and she was dead on. The Chicken is so well marinated, that it keeps it moist. I got suckered in by the sign for 'grilled corn'. It was delicious and a good end to summer.I've been to the one on Church, but I favor the one here. All the corners have a restaurant or a bar. It makes it lively. Parking is a challenge on Saturday, just go and make it a blue plate special!,WOW! This restaurant truly is a hidden gem in Cole Valley. My boyfriend and I stopped in on a Sunday, not planning to go out for dinner. While driving by he said he'd heard great things and had been wanting to try. I suggested why not try it now since we are in the neighborhood because who knows when we would really be back.I am soooo glad we stopped because it completely surpassed all expectations! We ordered Batata Harra (fried potatoes), falafels, chicken shish tawook plate, and the hand kneeded bread. We were sharing and it was a good thing we did because the portion size was pretty big. The fried potatoes were awesome! They were crispy and the spices gave it alot of flavor. The hand kneeded bread was worth getting, it was recommended by the waiter and unique the way it rose into this crisp, light bread (perfect for dipping into the hummus)! The falafels weren't bad, maybe a tad dry but otherwise came with a lovely light tehina sauce. And lastly the star of the show was the chicken kebabs, the chicken was so juicy and paired perfectly with the rice. Honestly we licked our plates clean. I was so impressed with the meal I've been telling so many people and I can't wait to come back for more!,When I first visited the city I saw this on the train and my friend tracked down the name and we came on my last visit to California. It was better than I imagined. The cheese, the hummus, the chicken entree was (huge) and absolutely incredible. Cute, cozy, good prices for the city, and delicious. What's not to love?,The food is delicious! Amazing flavors. Each dish has a different profile so you feel like you're really getting a variety of flavors. We each got our own order but definitely recommend ordering family style. They've got a nice outdoor seating area that's right by the MUNI line so it can get noisy but in a nice and un-bothersome way in my opinion. It's also right in a valley so it's not too windy.Not 5 stars because staff is a little cold and service is slow. It wasn't really busy when we got there so harder to look past the service,I always pass by this spot when I ride the MUNI & finally got the chance to check this place out. It is a lovely brunch spot. We shared the chicken kabobs (so juicy!), mezze sampler (loved the hummus & pepper dip), and some extra veggies for dipping. The food was great and ambience was lovely, would definitely come again!,Tried this place for the first time last night after some friends invited us. It was pretty popular and we got the last table for four. We ordered a few appetizers and the kneaded bread (which I highly recommend!). I also got the chicken plate which is their take on the chicken kebab. That was also delicious. The food was reasonably priced and the service was friendly. There was a long pause in between our apps and mains but it wasn't a big deal. Which leads me to my only complaint. This place has a very busy delivery business and it seems it's at the expense of their in person business. I think if they can find a better balance, then they'd get an extra star. But overall it's good food, at a good price, with pleasant service. I'd come back.,Passed by here so many times while living in Haight and as an Arab woman myself, I was eager to try some true middle eastern cuisine in the city. We came in around 7 on a Friday and we were lucky to find a spot for three indoors because after about 20 minutes the line was out the door. It was a bit cold since it's the winter and they left their door wide open. However the food, did not disappoint. Every single item we had was amazing. My favorites being the beef kabob and squash appetizer! Everything was extremely flavorful we might have as well just licked the plates after we were done because we ate every last bite. Kitchen was decently fast as we were waiting no longer than 15 minutes to receive our appetizers. All in all - if you're thinking about it, go! I'll definitely be back here plenty of times and bring all my friends to try. :),It's my second time at Beit Rima!! I love this little gem in Cole Valley! I went here with a few gals and we ordered the Mezze sampler, baked halloumi, and whole fried branzino. It was the perfect amount of food for the three of us. The fish was super moist, flavor full, and the rice it came with was so yum. The service can get quite slow if they are busy but it's worth the wait. Pro tip: put your name on the waitlist via yelp prior to arriving to beat the lines,Chicken shish tawook plate was my favorite over the beef kabob. Great portion size as I had leftovers for the next meal.The hummus is very creamy and super yum.,My coworker recommended this place to me because the muni always stops in front of this restaurant and he would get swept away by the amazing smell of spices. We finally decided to go try it together and it was soooo good. You must order the bread! It's fluffy with green seasoning on there. It goes perfectly with any dip on the menu. The hummus has a strong earthy taste. If you're used to the grocery store bought hummus, then this one might be an acquired taste. Everything on the menu is flavorful. The portion is pretty big too. I would definitely come back! It's going to be my go-to place for Arabic food in Cole Valley.,We got the chicken shish tawook plate and the mezze sampler. The chicken in the shish tawook plate was cooked just right, it practically melted in my mouth. Though the kneaded bread we ordered to go with the mezze sampler was the real star of the show. The perfect texture mix of crispy on the outside and soft on the inside that paired excellently with the lebna which although is a strained yogurt, tasted very much like goat cheese. Even though there was a line, our food was out within about 5 minutes of ordering. It is a bit loud inside the restaurant considering the music as well as how many people tend to hit this spot at any given time. This is merely a testament to how incredible the food is. But something to consider if you're looking for a more low-key evening.,I have been to this location 2 times now. The outside decor is very cute. Staff are very friendly here. They have the best falafel I've had in SF. It is crispy on the outside and not dried at all on the inside. Other places use filler ingredients in their falafels that make it dry. Ordered the chicken plate and fried potatoes dish. Everything tasted great and I would come here again. If you plan to come here at night time it's best to wear a warm jacket. Cole Valley can be really cold at night since it's neighboring The Sunset. I had the fog & wind roll in on me while I was dining outdoors one time and it was not pleasant.,Quick update:These were great as wellShashuka w cheeseWhole fried branzino-fishFried potato,The menu is great and food is absolutely wonderful.  The Hummus Ma'Lehma is worth returning for forever!  We love how great the chicken shish looks yet 3 of the last 4 times we ordered it, the chicken was undercooked which is kind of dangerous.  We finally need to stop ordering it I guess.  I love the a la carte falafel.  We still return regularly.,Great foods and service! Will definitely go back and try different dishes! Hope we can have more luck finding a parking,A wonderful glow up for the old BurgerMeister spot.  Lots of burger competition, so delicious Middle Eastern food makes more sense.  It's fast casual where you pay at the counter and get a number, so pretty efficient.Baked Halloumi: There's really no better way to start a meal than with yummy cheese.  Their cheese has a nice browned exterior and is resting in a flavorful sauce.  Put it on a pita and it's absolutely delicious.  I did see earlier Yelp photos of fresh baked pita, while the pita I got was clearly from a bag.  Might be because of COVID short staffing.  But would be wonderful to try when it's back.Chicken Shish Tawook Plate: Three skewers of heavily marinated and tender chicken.  Just the right amount of pickled veggies and grilled veggies to contrast the flavors.  Some tender rice and pita-from-a-bag.  Oh, and a pile of fluffy hummus.  Such a great meal with so many flavors.Beef Kabob Plate: Similar setup to the chicken, but the beef was cylindrical spiced meatballs that were grilled.  You can get even more spices packed into ground meat, so I was a fan.  Wish they had a kabob sampler though, so I could try the various grilled meats in one large plate.,I was surprised to see a second location for this wonderful Middle Eastern cafe so close to the first one on Church Street. After all, it's only two stops away on the N-Judah MUNI line, but owner Samir Mogannam has established such a unique foothold with his fresh, vegetarian-friendly dishes that I think he's really set a much higher bar for familiar Middle Eastern dishes. In other words, he could open his business anywhere, and that would be fine by me. Western SoMa would be great if you're looking for suggestions, Samir.The name means the house of Samir's Jordanian mother whose name is Rima. It fits well with the immaculate homestyle approach of the cuisine here, and I think the best representation is the $18 Mezze Sampler where a quintet of specialties resided seamlessly on the same plate (photo: bit.ly/3t717Dt). The hummus represented their house specialty, a creamy chickpea tahini dip topped with garlic, lemon, and spices.The baba ganoush was also quite familiar and satisfying, fire-roasted eggplant mixed with tahini, urfa (Turkish chili pepper), and mint.The lebna was a dollop of strained yogurt with za'atar and olive oil. The muhammara was the least familiar to me, a roasted pepper spread with walnuts, almonds, pomegranate molasses, and spices. That turned out to be my favorite. There were also two housemade falafel balls made of cucumber, sumac onions, and tahina, as well as pickle slices and other pickled vegetables. Of course, it came with a basket of freshly baked pita which were seductively puffy (photo: bit.ly/3eHOwhh). That's if you consider puffiness seductive. Great quality food. I can't wait for Samir's third, fourth, and fifth locations.FOOD - 5 stars...honestly the best Middle Eastern fast food in townAMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...bright teal and floral designs brighten this spot as does the ample outdoor seatingSERVICE - 4.5 stars...attentive and responsive TOTAL - 5 stars...the second location for this wonderful Middle Eastern cafe with the mezze platter a winnerRELATED - Exploring the Haight? Here's a collection of places I've visited and reviewed: bit.ly/2YK1e99,After finally finding a parking space, we headed into Beit Rima (Rima's House). Lots of pictures on the wall of Arab stars, and sayings, words to songs, most of which were Egyptian. We were pleasantly surprised to find she's actually Palestinian, like my husband. There were quite a few little tables outside on the street and maybe 5 inside. We ate inside because it was a tad chilly. Anyhoo, the three of us ordered some dishes to share. Hummus (dukkah style-with sumac, chopped jalapeños). EXCELLENT. Super lemony and yummy. I couldn't get enough of this. Ful w/soft egg. Also super yummy. Chicken Shish Tawook w/rice, hummus and pickled beets. The rice and chicken were very good, with the chicken very moist and flavorful, but I thought this a bit expensive at $22. Samir's homemade bread w/zaatar. OMG this big fluffy pita was SO GOOD. I'm glad we ordered two, even though one was big enough. Batata Harra. Crispy potatoes. I liked them, but my husband wasn't impressed. Turkish coffee would be a nice add on. We ordered way too much food for three people, but that just meant great leftovers for later. I'm very happy Beit Rima came up on Yelp for restaurants close by. We went to the De Young Museum in GGP, and this place isn't too far away. Parking is difficult, but it was worth it. We'll be back.Shukran ya Rima!,Very cute small place; we came on a weekday night so it wasn't too busy for a table of 6. Outdoor seating available. Service was fast - you have to get up and order at the cashier so maybe on a busy night the line to pay and order may be longer.Menu was straightforward - a good column of appetizers, entree option for each protein (chicken, beef, lamb, steak, etc), and a few desserts.BIG PORTION size! For me I had leftovers that I took home for second delicious meal. Chicken was nice and tender with slightly crunchy skin. Love the marinade with the rice and the grilled onions and veggies. Potatoes were good and crunchy - very nice sauce!Hummus and other dips were plentiful for all of us we shared two sample platters and there was still leftover dip. We got extra pita as well.,Excellent service! Such a friendly staff. Food is great. If you happen to sit outside your night will be ruined by cable car. You better to book inside. I was expecting a authentic Arabic low key music but it didn't fit the atmosphere of this place.,Delicious dips and food, but may take a while! I surprisingly loved the salad, and all the dips were so delicious. Lots of mint added. The falafel was very fresh. The location is great especially on a sunny day. There is outdoor seating and heaters. The waiter definitely forgot about us because 4 groups who came after us were served before us, but that happens sometimes.,HOLY MOLY EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING. we got the Hummus, falafel balls, muhamarra (our absolute favvvvv) and an amazing zaatar bread that was divine. i love the casual style. you stand in line and place an order and pay ahead. they bring it to your table. such a lovely casual dinner or lunch spot. the food is GREAT. go here!,The food here is delicious. The service was good but there were many difficulties due to miscommunication issues. Went on a Friday evening and there was barely a wait even though my party showed up and joined the waitlist upon arrival (rather than joining online). Once you are seated, you get to read through the menu and have to go up to the register to place your order. Someone will come by your table to take the rest of the menus, and you're given a number so they know where to bring the food/drinks you ordered.The problem with my party's order is the person running the register seemed to not have caught some of it. But it's fine; mistakes happen, right? On the first attempt, we were able to get our muhammara (first time I've had this; surprisingly nutty like peanut butter), Samir's hand kneaded bread (comes out very hot, great to dip into the muhammara), baked halloumi, shakshuka, chicken shish tawook (meant to be ordered on its own, so it came with a lot of extras like hummus and rice that was too much for my party eating family style, DELICIOUS and surprisingly not dry), and the beef kabob plate (a bit dry and not very tasty, would not order again). After waiting a long time and speaking to a waiter it came to my party's attention that the two other items we thought we ordered were not on the way. Take two; re-ordered the batata harra (always will love fried potatoes) and the falafels. Unfortunately even after reordering, the falafels will still punched in as 2 falafels rather than 4 like we specified. We also added muhalabia for dessert, probably wouldn't order this again (it was fine for what it was but didn't love the flow petals on top despite it looking very pretty). Overall very good food and would eat here again. Make sure to check your receipt after ordering to avoid miscommunications.,Always on the lookout for really good Middle Eastern food.  After scoping out the positive yelp reviews,  I decided to treat myself to a day in San Francisco and eat at Beit Rima.  So glad I did! It was a delightful experience from start (when I found a nearby parking spot with uncommon ease), to finish (when I practically licked my plates clean cause everything was so delicious!).The restaurant's decor is so, so cute -- checkered tablecloths, vintage photos, atmospheric effects from Palestine, lovely plants in macrame hangers.  The guy at the counter who took my order was very warm and hospitable -- I was a little confused about what to order since it was my first time there, and he kindly brought me a sweet fresh mint tea on the house.  That made my day.  I ordered the beef kebab plate and the delicata squash.  Omgggg both dishes were so good; perfectly balanced with complex flavors.  Cinnamon was employed masterfully in the squash dish, a nice savory-sweet interplay.  The beef kebabs had a succulent texture and good spicing; rice was superb; hummus light and creamy; pickled onions, roasted tomatoes, tahini sauce, hot sauce all excellent.  The presence of the cucumber pickles took this over the top for me, I absolutely love those.  Wished I could have tried more dishes at Beit Rima, I can tell everything is good.  Can't wait to go back.  Israelis were mobbing the place and a couple cute guys giving me the eye.  If I lived in San Francisco I'd be hanging out there all the time lol,I still remember the first time I fell in love with Beit Rima's Arabic comfort food at the original location on Church St, and after numerous visits, this remains one of my favorite restaurants in the entire Bay Area! After all these years, the menu hasn't been altered much, and the flavors and presentation of the food were as amazing as ever! For me, the highlight of any Middle Eastern meal is the mezze small plates, which are perfect for sharing. The Mezze Sampler came with lebna (yogurt topped with za'atar), baba ganoush (pureed eggplant and tahini), muhamarra (roasted red pepper with walnuts, almonds, and pomegranate molasses), hummus (chickpeas and tahini topped with Rima's relish), and two perfectly crispy falafel balls served with cucumbers, sumac onions, and tahini. We also ordered the Ful, a creamy dip made of fava beans and topped with Rima's Relish (garlic, lemon, chilies) and plenty of olive oil; and the Baked Halloumi, or crispy chunks of squeaky Cypriot cheese with chopped jalapeños and Meyer lemon. All of the mezze dishes went nicely with the chewy Jerusalem pita on the side--but speaking of bread, another must-order item was Samir's Hand Kneaded Bread, a freshly-baked, chewy, crusty, extra large pita seasoned with caraway, nigella, and thyme, and topped with plenty of za'atar and olive oil!As if this spread of dips couldn't already make for a full meal, next came the main dishes--the Chicken Shish Tawook Plate came with yogurt marinated chicken kebabs, charred onion/red pepper, hummus, and ""mom's rice."" But the star entree was the Grilled Hanger Steak, a super juicy, pleasantly chewy sliced steak (cooked to a perfect rare) served with smokey freekeh and a slightly spicy, herbaceous green zhug. Every dish here was full of flavor, delicious, and colorfully plated, and despite the casual counter-service setting, the restaurant staff was extremely friendly and helpful in setting our party up at a table. What an amazing neighborhood restaurant and gem of the city!,The food here is SO delicious and high quality. Their mezze and meat plates are above average, but the dish that really redefines expectations is the delicata squash. It is SOOOO good. There's also a bunch of variety on the menu.This location has amazing outdoor ambiance on a sunny day and better than the Duboce location. The outdoor seating is particularly nice - really cute on a nice sidewalk.The service doesn't exist - you order and pay upfront and find a seat. It sounds like fast casual but it feels much more elevated!,This has been my favorite Doordash go to three times in the past week. My favorite is the Chicken Shish. A kabob with chicken marinating in yogurt, bell peppers and onions and is served on a bed of rice (which is also quite tasty), hummus, pickled vegetables and a piece of pita. Creating a pita with all these items is a fantastic harmony of flavor. I've also tried the Hanger Steak which is also very tender with a slightly spicy green sauce called zhug. The Falafel is a great choice also. Im looking forward to many more meals and hopefully enjoy a dine in experience at Beit Rima :),A gem in SF! The branzino was perfect! Everything was absolutely delightful - like every establishment in San Francisco, price point was a bit high for amount of food that comes... But it's a great place for friends to gather and enjoy a meal together! You pay and order before you dine and they bring the food to your table! This makes dining out with friends and keeping your order separate much easier. My only annoyance with our dining experience is when we were done eating, our lady server spilled the sauce while collecting the empty platters... She was hasty and didn't even apologize or credit us anything and when we left we realized she had spilled the sauce all over my friend's jacket that was hanging on the chair. I heard her earlier in the evening touting to her fellow coworkers that it was her last shift there... So I'm not sure if that affected how hasty she had been. It was unfortunate because it tainted our experience... So overall, good food and great location and easy ordering... Just watch out for servers spilling on you!,The food is really good. We picked up, and they forgot something important, so we had to drive back, and they had accidentally given our item to someone else, which was annoying, but they were cool about it and resolved it quickly, and the good food makes up for it.I used to use the N-Judah stop right in front of Beit Rima at least twice a week, and the restaurant was never busy, but now, it seems like it's always hoppin'. I don't know that I would eat in, but the food is high quality. I'll have to give it more tries to confirm, but I think four stars is about right.,Came here for early Sunday dinner after a hike up to Tank Hill. It was my first time in Cole Valley and I loved how homey the street and shops felt. We sat outside but was freezing even with heat lamps. Their model is you go in to ask for seating and menus, then you get seated and go back in to order and pay. This way, you just leave when you're done eating. I knew exactly what I wanted (mezze platter & chicken shawarma) and we quickly got our food. The mezze platter was smaller than I expected, though so delicious! Each dip had a creamy texture, even the baba ganoush, which was unexpected for me. I loved the chicken itself - the rest of the dish was just okay. They have wines for ~$11 by the glass. I wanted to try the West Bank red but they only sell that one for the bottle. Our meal was delicious and I can't wait to come back! Thankfully they have a closer location in the Castro.,While my fiancé loved his steak, my beef was very very dry. The sauce helped a little, and I have to say, the flavor was amazing, but tough to want to finish.Unfortunately after that, I bit into a piece of plastic in my rice! It was my fiancés birthday, and I understand things happen, so I didn't say anything. Overall, I would probably go again but maybe try the other location next time.,I'm not very familiar with Arabic food, but if this is what their comfort food is like, I would come here every week if I could. I find that most restaurants have a few really tasty dishes, but I truly believe this is the first time I liked every single dish that came out. Definitely come with friends so you can eat everything family style and try as many dishes as you can. I came with a party of 4 and I honestly wish I came with a bigger group so we could order everything on the menu. The delicata squash tasted like a dessert because it was so good, but not too sweet. Get the mezze sampler and chicken shish tawook plate!I'm pretty sure I'm going to get this restaurant to cater for my parties in the future.,Overall, solid dishes, especially loved the chicken; tender, Smokey and moist. Perfect!  The steak was a bit over cooked And tough The service was efficient and courteous. Possibly a bit on the pricey side but understandable,Delicious, authentic, and reasonably priced. My one complaint is their alcohol selection - they have just one red and I believe one white wine available, plus a small selection of canned and bottled beers. I'm sure if they expanded their offering, they'd see a ton of uptick in their business. That said, I'll definitely be back. Notable dishes include the hand kneaded bread (absolutely delicous and a very unique flavor), the grilled hanger steak (although in my opinion it could have used a bit more flavor), the mezze sampler, and the baked halloumi. That said, you really can't go wrong!,Absolutely yummy food! The halloumi cams on a sizzling plate and was so flavorful. Chicken was very tender and potatoes had a good kick of spice. Service was very fast :) would come again,Yum, YUm, YUM!!!! My bf and I were bumming around SF and needed to find a place for dinner. We were staying in the Twin Peaks area and found Beit Rima was within walking distance (but the walk was not really that easy, to be honest.)When we first arrived, we weren't sure if we needed to be sat, find a seat, or order then sit. I didn't see a sign clearly posted. We decided to wait in line. When we got up to the cashier, she helped up find a table and gave us some menus. Trying Arabic was a super fun experience! After an accidental mix-up, we ended up with Hummus, Falafel, Samir's Hand-Kneaded Bread, and Chicken Shish Tawook Plate. We ordered just slightly too much food but it was all delicious! The hummus ended up being most of my meal but every bite was wonderful! It didn't seem to get monotonous nor did I get tired of eating it. The pita is was served with was heavenly! Very soft, warm, and with some slight chew. The falafel are a la carte, and we got 4. The sauce they were served with helped some of the dryness and really added a nice brightness to them. Samir's hand-kneaded bread was very, very tasty! I could've licked the olive oil off the plate...The main star was the Chicken Shish Tawook Plate. HOLY MOLY... packed with flavor that is comforting and mouthwatering, this plate was well done! Probably the best thing we ordered, although it was all good. The inside of Beit Rima is a bit loud. Felt like we had to almost shout at each other across the table during a very busy dinner hour. There is outside seating although on a cold afternoon, not sure I would want to be in the breeze. The only strange thing to me was wondering how to be sat. Past that, the actual meal and service were great. If you're looking for something new to try, definitely give this a go!! 9/10 recommend,Amazing authentic Arabic food! I'm Syrian so love that this food hits close to home. The restaurant is cute with nice outdoors and friendly service. The baked halloumi is sooo good. A must. Shakshouka was also really good. We were fasting so they gave us complimentary dates and tea! Very friendly there. My only thing is plates are small portions for the price. But tasty! Recommend.,Dear cashier with long black hair on Sunday 8/8 around 3pm: you are rude! This place was a bit chaotic: no host.. cashier inside.. we didnt really know what to do. We went inside to put our name on some kind of list but the cashier kept going in and out of register and not acknowledging us. After I good 5 minutes of wondering what was happening she finally came to me. I asked her if she could help us and she said "" to help you, you need a table! You have to sit first! "" (implying i didnt know i needed a table lol)., so i replied "" precisely; that is why we have been patiently waiting to understand if we need to put our name on a list! "" and then she said "" well a table just opened! "" (as if i was supposed to know..!) i responded "" great! Good to know! "" lol.. she was outrageously rude.We got seated and then were told to go back inside to order. Weird?! Lol So we went to order and waited for food. I have to say the busser was SUPER nice and he should manage the place. Eventually when she came to deliver an item she waited with plates in hand staring at the table. I was like whats her problem?! There is nothing there except a water glass ! So i just moved it more to the side than it was. She slammed the food down and bounced.. She should be talked to by management ! Terrible customer service.In the end: the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food was ok. Sample platter ok. Batata harra ok. Foul ok. Haloumi ok. The squash was sooo weird. I wish i had been warned that it was actually sweet with cinnamon and honey.This place might work for americans but i think that for ppl from the middle east or Turkish.. this is a joke. That said; food LOOK,Long time coming but this place is awesome. A great starter experience here is to get the muhammar, Sameer's bread and the chicken plate. I challenge you to eat that and not walk out feeling happy. This restaurant is great for casual weekend brunch, casual weekday dinner or takeout. I'd say it works on more days/times of the week but honestly I'm already here 1-2x per week I mean that's a lot right? Hard to eat at the same restaurant 3x per week even if it's freakin French Laundry,What a unique and interesting find.  If you like Lebanese, Turkish or Greek cuisine, definitely try this place.  It's Palestinian Middle Eastern food.  The grilled meat was delicious.  They make their own bread that's $5 and similar to pita but a little different.  The fatoush salad was very good.  The falafel was just okay.  Good hummus too.  Overall very flavorful and interesting restaurant.  I had takeout but I would definitely go back to dine in.  They have a few tables inside and several outside.  The place was full today.I don't like that they have to add 5% for the city mandate but it's every restaurant in San Francisco.,Upbeat indoor and outdoor restaurant that's just near the N Judah tunnel.  Very tasty Middle Eastern dishes with fresh ingredients.,What an incredible discovery. I'm finding myself thinking about Beit Rima a few days after having enjoyed there a lovely comforting outdoor lunch on an overcast day.Everything from the hummus to the lebna (yogurt) to the ful (beans) went wonderfully well with their bread (the Samir's especially), a high-protein delectable meal.What made the experience really imprint was sitting besides the frequent passing bart trams and an overview of the hills surrounding Cole valley with houses atop. Somehow they seemed to take me back to Switzerland, and I can't wait to venture back to central SF and try some of their other offerings.,Beit Rima was a great lunch spot, with delicious food. The service was a little lacking, and the staff seemed a bit frazzled. We asked to be seated outside but the employee we asked said we wouldn't be able to, without explaining why. Besides this, The mezze sampler was my favorite thing I tried. The beef kabob entree was also generous in size and delicious. The prices were around 25-30 dollars per entree, but portion sizes were large.,First time visiting and the only thing I'm sad about is that I DIDN'T DISCOVER THIS SPOT EARLIER!! This is definitely a neighborhood gem and I can probably eat here every day.What we got: Mezze Sampler (sampler with hummus, yoghurt, falafel, flatbread) Samir's hand kneaded bread Chicken Shish Tawook Plate Batata Harra (fried potatoes) All of these items were so flavorful and full of fragrant spices. I usually am able to pick out a favorite dish but I really can't this time because they were all top notch!! However, my standout dish may be the Chicken Shish Tawook Plate: I was blown away by how tender the Chicken was, and it paired really well with the rice (flavored with some oil). I also liked putting some hummus and yoghurt on the meat / potatoes. It was such a satisfying meal with lots of leftovers that I ate for the rest of the week. I can't wait to come back and would love to try the hanger steak next time!,We had the Beef Mezze Hummus app and Chicken Skewer platter. Absolutely well prepared and so fresh. It's a casual, cozy vibe at Beit Rima. We ate outside in the early evening a stayed warm next to the heaters. Just moved to SF. This is going to be one of my favorite spots. Thank you BR!,Such a great little gem of Cole Valley. Their food is amazing and very fresh. I usually cannot finish my plate but I was done with my food in no time. The staff is very friendly and makes you feel welcomed and taken care of. I will be definitely coming back to try their other dishes. Make sure to try the desserts! They were very interesting and I really liked the combination of pistachio and rose flavors.,My baby shower was on Saturday and Beit Rima catered the event for me. Not only was the catered food amazing and just as good as eating it in the restaurant (which I've done at least 5 times) there was not a single complaint in the house about it - literally everyone, man woman and child loved the food! I was a little worried because we did have some picky eaters but even they loved it! There were rave reviews that day and I still have people texting me about how good the food was. The food was delivered and set up exactly at the time we agreed upon. He even explained to our guests what the food was since I was running around greeting everyone. There were probably 30 ppl and I ordered more than enough food.What I ordered (some of these things may be spelled wrong)Lebnah (yogurt dip)Mahammara (red pepper dip)HummusChicken skewers x3Beef kebabs x2Falafel x2Pita breadRice - this wasn't on the catering menu but my husband really wanted it and Chef Samir was really kind and provided it for us 100000 / 10 would order again and I recommend this restaurant to cater any event. I wish I would have gotten a pic,Everything I've eaten here has been delicious. My go to for lunch is the ful with a soft boiled egg. Dinner wise I get the chicken plate, but if you're with a group, definitely start with the mezze plate and handmade bread. FYI: the plates are big enough to share, but also perfect for leftovers. This place is a bit expensive but totally worth it.,It's ok. Tastes good but I wanted real arabic food. The hummus and baba ganoush were not well seasoned. Their chicken was good but the rice was not the typical Lebanese with vermicelli. I had high hopes!,Taste is very average for a Lebanese restaurant, Nothing was a tasty or unique , it's just food at this point , wouldn't come back here again .,The Beit Rima on church is one of my favorite restaurants in SF so it should come as no surprise that this location pleases me just as much. I really love both their mezze and entrees and while it can add up price wise (especially if you get the whole fried fish) the portions aren't bad and the quality is just consistently high. I'm in the neighborhood now which is a little dangerous for my finances.,Delicious fabulous dinner. We were missing our church st Beit Rima but we found the cole valley location, thank heavens. See food pics for the fabulousness xo,Got the potatoes side dish as a tapas. It had a sauce and it was alright. Got a coca cola with it. It was a snack and the other items are expensive. Second visit to Beit Rima. First one on Church.,Make no mistake, the food here is delicious and fresh and one of the better Mediterranean spots I've tried. I love their plates- the chicken shish tawook is made really well, tender and filled with flavor. However," there is room for improvement here. I see that I'm not the only here who experienced cold and rude service from the staff (for me it was the female cashier who misspoke and said my meal was $33 and when I corrected her she bluntly said """"tax"""" and the real value showed up as $23). I appreciate that the owner had reached out to me promptly to follow up on this incident", which for me was my first and only time here. The meal was otherwise great and I hope that the next time I come, the service will be better.,Yum! This my second time at Beit Rima, and my first time at this location. The chicken skewer is absolutely juicy, the hanger steak flavorful and the mezzo platter such a delight to eat (order veggies for dipping! for the health :)),Such a cute, quaint spot to stop by and try some amazing Middle Eastern food! We stopped by after a hike in the nearby area and it was such a great cozy spot to rest and relax outdoors for lunch.We tried the baked halloumi, the muhammara, and the chicken shish tawook plate. The halloumi was drenched in a nice lemony sauce and was bright and tangy, and the muhammara was sweet and nutty and absolutely delicious with a side of pita. The star of the meal was definitely the chicken shish tawook though. The pieces of chicken were incredibly juicy and flavorful, perfectly tender with a nice char on the outside. They were topped off with the most delicious toum (garlic sauce) and served with hummus and grilled peppers and onions. Even the rice on the side was amazingly buttery and flavorful. It was honestly one of the best chicken dishes I've ever had. I am definitely looking forward to coming back and trying all their other dips (and of course, to get that chicken plate again!),Wow. This place is incredible. It's some of the freshest Mediterranean food I've ever had. The two plates we ordered were filling, really flavourful, and pretty unique considering they are staples for most similar spots. The service is quick even though they are often very busy so be aware of that. Our to-go orders are always on point and packaged with care. Definitely a favourite for Mediterranean comfort food at an affordable price point so we are happy to stay regulars!,Stopped to eat here and meet with a friend. The vibe of the place was impeccable. I sat here for hours just chit chatting and munching on some amazing food. I could look at my meal and capture it with my eyes first before my taste buds. The spices they use are both aesthetically pleasing and great to the taste, even the plates they use remind me of home! The bread was warm, the servers were so friendly and kind, and this place truly reminded me of home. Thank you Beit Rima for this authentic experience! Thank you servers and cooks! :),You order your food T the counter and the food is amazing. Delicious!! Especially the Falafels. Will definitely come back.,Loved this place, food is delicious and I can't wait to be back in SF to go again. Everything we tried including the wine was so good!,Got a variety for pick up and it was very satisfying!Favorite was the lamb shank (4.5 stars): tender, fatty, in a delicious tomato based sauce, with buttered rice!Delicata squash (4 stars) was a close second, which came on top of a slightly sweetened yogurt/cream sauceWe also tried 2 dips - the ful (bean based) and muhammara (sweeter, walnut/pepper). These were nice and went well with the hand bread. Falafel was only $1 per! A little on the dry side but can't go wrong.They were pretty busy when we went in for take out, with nice patio seating, as well as a few tables indoors as well,Went to this cute little place based on a reccomendation. It did not dissapoint!We arrived around noon but by 1 it was beginning to get crowded. I like how simple the menu is. They seem to know what they are good at and go from there. Lots of foundational food and combinations of those. Very fair prices.Great for vegetarians and non vegetarians alike. We got the vegetarian sampler dish and it was awesome. Great for 2 people to share for a light lunch or appitizer. Nice counter service and engaged employees.,I really like this place! They are fast and efficient. Imagine a casual Arabic food place but on steroids! Yes the prices are a bit more but you can definitely taste the quality! I like how you order at the register and how casual it is!,Some of the best Mediterranean cuisine me and my family have ever tasted. The service was quick and the staff were polite and very quick with refilling our water. Overall I would definitely recommend as the use of spices are great.,This place was packed and for good reason. You grab a table and order at the counter. You'll get a number to bring to your table, and the waiters will bring your food to you. I was blown away by this place. The sampler offered a good variety of spreads that were all fantastic and paired well with both the denser pita and the fluffy hand pulled bread. I genuinely thought it couldn't get better until the entrees came. The hanger steak was oh so tender and cooked to perfection.The chicken kebob plate had my boyfriend doing happy dances. Chicken was juicy and flavorful and went amazingly with the spicy sauce.. ask for the spicy sauce!!,This was my sons favorite place.  It was a quiet weekday afternoon.  Not busy except for a few families and locals doing takeout.  The sampler was really good for the dips.  We got 1 kebab beef with extra skewers of chicken fir 3 for a light lunch.  Was perfect with the flight and all the bread!   Chix was our favorite.  Juicy thighs.  The beef wasn't steak bites like expected but was still flavorful.  The sauce and the rice was really good too.  Cute place.  Yum!!!,The food here is quite unique. Perhaps not for San Francisco but for someone traveling from the bay area this food is excellent. Small boutique restaurant with an excellent menu. If I'm back in the city anytime soon you know I'm gonna come here first.,The flavor at this place is impeccable. It's everything I want from a Mediterranean restaurant. I just wish I loved closer. Please open a location in the east bay,Ordered the whole fish, which was about $35.  Not much bigger than a sardine, pulled maybe 2 ounces of fish off the bones.  Other items had good flavor, but too expensive overall and not a filling meal.Got the impression it's a trendy place that can get away with overcharging, won't be going back.,In the beginning of Covid, their online ordering was on point.  I would get takeouts and it would be ready right as I expected it to be.  The last two orders, have been botched.  No more online ordering for me. The food is still great, just wish I didnt open my dinners at home with something unexpected.  Tonight, online requested for the hummus to be substituted with salad.  Rice usually comes with the plate.  No rice only salad and chicken.  Also when picking up, theres three workers all focused on getting something done.  I stand there for three minutes with no acknowledgement," not even a """"we'll be right with you"""".  I understand its peak time when I arrive but the smallest gestures go along way.  Last takeout order", falafels were missing.  Check your entire order if you do any takeouts.,Very bad food quantity, bad service, verypricey, I will never come back or recommendthis place, shame on Mediterranean be likethis.They charge me more what it should be also missed-up my order after half an hour waiting we got the half of what we ordered then we thought we gonna get the rest of the order we waited 10 min then no thing happened I have walked to the register and asked about the order they said that we didn't order we have gotten what we ordered they have to charge me twice for the rest of the order I need the owner to refund what I been charged twice . This place is a miss .,FOOD WAS AMAZING!! I love how they have you pay before you eat; it feels so much smoother than having to wait for your check and go through the confusion of splitting if you're with friends. I personally wish the menus had pictures, but it wasn't bothersome for me. Aside from the service, everything tasted great. I had the Batata Harra, which is fried potatoes. I felt it would be a boring choice, but it was far from that. The sauce and the crunch were unmatched. My friends and I shared our dishes altogether and got to try the Hummus that was topped with lemon, garlic, and chilies and the Chicken Shish Tawook Plate. All were flavorful, filling, and worthy of a second try. The interior design of the restaurant is cute too which is a plus!,Really great place for Mediterranean-- I'd recommend the batata harra (fabulously crispy potatoes drizzled with a sauce I could drink) or fatoush (green salad with pitted dates, fresh mint, and pita chips) to share and the chicken shish tawook plate or the grilled hangar steak for mains (both are well seasoned and cooked to perfection). Definitely a more causal vibe to the place (you order at the counter and then grab a table) but it's beautiful nonetheless!,Omg the food! So fresh and the flavors are the best I have ever had (and I love Middle Eastern Food).  Very fresh ingredients! The meat is never dry - so flavorful and the perfect amount. I have eaten a bunch of dishes there and am sad to say that I cannot pick a favorite. They are ALL MY FAVORITE!  Please go there and order away! I just tell my daughter to order whatever she wants and I always love it. I love their food for takeout because it does not suffer from standing and cooling down. So for potlucks (when you can't get time to cook) order things from here. Also good for starters.,Mezze platter was stellar. Super friendly warm staff. Great overall experience. Definitely will be back again.,Such a yummy neighborhood spot! Must get the figs and cream and mint tea was so sweet and yummy,Yeah I really liked it! Got the chicken shish, the app plate and the hand made bread. With 2 drinks and tip about $70. That's why not 5 stars cuz I'm cheap. BUT on the value side, there were leftovers (could have fed 3.)Also, I'm covid shy. I don't eat out much anymore. I chose this place because they have nice seating out front. Unfortunately there were many people there with their darling offspring who (sorry kids-not your fault) are little covid infection carriers...happily screaming and running around.  One couple requested that we move to another table so they could push 2 tables (ours being one) together so they could fit the kiddles. I said no cuz we waited for that table so we could be distanced from other diners. Next time I'm ordering 1) less food and 2) getting it to go. I'll bring a blanket and sit on the grass in the little parklet next door.,I've drive past this place several times and always wanted to try it. We just moved down the street so we figured, why not, We finally went. First off they sat us outside in a table with no heater, when we politely asked if it was possible to move either inside or get a heater that wasn't being used," the server right away said """"No."""" And he kinda just walked away . I was a bit surprised but knew they were busy so I didn't take it further. We waited about 20 minutes just for our starter which was 3 half pieces of pita bread and hummus. After that we waited for another 20 minutes in the cold until we finally decided that we wanted to leave.We are never the type to have left a restaurant but this was really kinda unbearable. We went inside to ask for a refund", unless the food was ready we would take it to go and eat it at home. We ended taking the food home with us.The food itself was decent, until I bit into a fairly large piece of stone that was logged into the meat. It made a loud scrape noise and everyone at the table heard it. I literally laughed at how comical this experience was. I feel as though I just threw away $115. I stopped eating my food after I bit into the stone. Bellow is fragment of the stone I bit into.,Please stay the same!! :)We had lunch on a Saturday and it was a great experience. When we got there, the place was buzzing, which is a good sign.We got seated within 5 minutes, we placed our order in 5 minutes, and we got our food in 15 minutes.Mezze sampler - labneh was my least favorite, babaganoush was okay, hummus was good and muhammara was very good.Falafel was perfect.Deep fried branzino was very good. Rice was very good.Samir's bread was an experience, won't order again unless in a large group.Overall a very good lunch experienceUpdate after eating the leftovers, labneh tasted good with falafel,A friend took me here, and this place opened my mind to eating falafel for the rest of my life. Everything was delicious. Can't wait to go back.,Came again and tried the fava bean appetizer and it was decent, a bit like retried beans. Came with a gooey egg - and 2 small pita breads. The beef kabob and the skirt steak were good... but the yogurt sauce chicken skewer plate is the best entree in my opinion.,We were there on 9/18/2021 PM - Two stars. The cashier was rude and appeared stressed. The food was served very cold, the kebab plates' - meat was very hard and chewy and lacked mediterranean flavor, the rice was overcooked (very small portion as if it was for a small child) and the hummus was smeared onto the plates (very small portion as if it was for small child). Pita bread was ice cold. We ate some because we were hungry.  The wait was long and not worth waiting for. Overall a bad experience.If you are the owner of this place and are reading this, please make an improvement. We know the flavor of Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food because we grew up eating it and this did not taste like it to us. I almost want to ask for our money back. I did not notice the cashier washing her hands before handling the water glasses. Very pricey for the quality and quantity of the food served to us. We will not be coming back.,Loved everything from here and can't believe I didn't know about it already. The beef hummus and chicken plate were the standout dishes along with the Zaatar Pita. This is my new go-to Arabic/Mediterranean spot and I can't wait to try some other dishes,I wanted to give this place another try after a really bad customer service experience the first time pre covid. Unfortunately out was disappointing the second time around too. First, their seating system was very disorganized. I had to persistently tell different waiters that we wanted to be seated, otherwise would've been forgotten and left waiting for longer. Most disappointing however was the food - the portions were all tiny! From my last visit I had remembered the food being the saving grace, but unfortunately this time that was not true. I was expecting some complimentary pita and hummus but never received it. The appetizers we got were laughingly small in portion size, and we didn't enjoy the taste of one of them (forgot name). Only the chicken kebabs we ordered tasted good. Needles to say, I won't be coming back here.,This is a neighborhood favorite! Always very yummy and satisfying and a step up from the usual Mediterranean places. You pay at the counter and then grab a table and they bring you food. But it doesn't feel like fast casual food at all. Really high quality food!We always get:Chicken Shish Tawook Plate + Hummus or babaganosh plate for 2 to share. It's a lot of food and we're usually stuffed after. The chicken is well seasoned and tender and their dips are very fresh and flavorful. The mezze is a good place to start if you haven't been before as it has a variety of the dips and some falafel too. After getting it once I now just get the things I know I like. I personally think the falafel is a little dry and underwhelming but it's a good filler for pita sandwiches which I sometimes make after getting some falafel to go. You can also get their pita to go in a bag which always tastes better than store bought from Safeway. The house made kneaded bread is kind of fun too, it's warm, oily (in a good way) with lots of spices and zatar. Overall very cute, very yummy, and a place to come back to.,This place was excellent. The food was perfectly seasoned and cooked, the ambiance was charming, and the staff was friendly and inviting. I got the chicken shish, and my handsome date had the gazan braised lamb shank. We also had Samir's hand kneaded bread which was warm and tasty and went perfectly with the hummus ma' lehma. Plus, the portions were really generous - we brought boxes home and literally had enough for 2 more meals. I will definitely be going back.,Food was fresh, flavorful and delicious. Will be coming back. The Fattoush was one of the best I've had.,When we couldn't decide on pizza, sushi or burritos we decided to try Beit Rima. We tried the sampler, the baked halloumi, hand kneaded bread and a chicken skewer a la carte. The sampler was great, I always enjoy trying a little bit of different things. The hand kneaded bread was delicious and it was a huge portion. The skewer was ok, I liked they offered it without having to buy the whole plate, but it lacked seasoning and was a little fatty. I'd definitely go back and try one of the rot plates, maybe their lamb.,This place was such an unexpected gem! It's pretty casual and quaint but the food is awesome! Baba ganoush was bomb! Rice, chicken, and hummus were amazing as well. This was filling for two people. Check it out!,Terrific Mediterranean place in cole valley!We walked into here on a Sunday morning because they have nice outdoor seating. Ordered a bunch of things - the Muhammara was the best of everything. Really delicious dip that goes well with both pita and falafel. Heard great things about the chicken kebab from others. The shakshuka was so-so. Definitely recommend!,Tasty, no wait, a bit chilly inside (they need a heater!). Baked halloumi ($11) - 3 slices, with diced jalapeño and lemon, in a small cast iron skillet.  I love halloumi cheese, and the jalapeño and lemon were refreshingly different accompaniments.  Don't worry, not spicy at all.Shakshuka ($12) - poached egg in super tasty tomato sauce, with halloumi cubes ($1).  Get this!Also don't forget to mix the egg into the tomato sauce as soon as it arrives to your table!  The cast iron skillet is very hot and wIll otherwise hard boil the egg yolk. Beef kabob ($18) - 3 pieces of tasty ground beef atop rice, 3 grilled cherry tomatoes, onions, and hummus w/diced jalapeños on the side.  Not bad, but portion is a bit small for the price and meat was a bit overdone/dry.Hot sweet tea with mint ($) - a few fresh mint leaves on top; good, not super sweet (but sweet enough for my sweet tooth), free refills.  I think it's the Arabic version of Lipton tea, judging by what the displayed boxes on the wall look like--I might try finding that version online.  FYI everyone in the restaurant had this as their beverage.Order at the counter.  No reservations for brunch, but it wasn't even half full on Sunday at 11am.  One menu all day.  Metered street parking within a block, or park a couple blocks away on the street for free (you will likely have to drive around a bit to find parking though).,Beit Rima doesn't mezze around with their appetizers. The Lebna, Muhammara, and Baba Ganoush are some of the best I've tried state-side.Oh, let me also rima-nd you to pair the Mezze Sampler with some Samir's Hand Kneaded Bread. Enjoy!,Ordered for delivery and didn't hold up that great (arrived cold even though the delivery was pretty quick). Ordered the chicken kebab, mezze platter and bread. Everything was ok. May be better dining in,Had a lovely meal here, it's a good spot to casually grab lunch with friends without needing a reservation. We got: Chicken Shish Tawook - This was the star - chicken so so so incredibly tender. Plus it comes with some veggies and hummus. Seriously just get that and call it a meal. Baba ganoush - This was my other favorite from the meal, creamy and smoky.Hummus - The hummus here is the chunkier thicker kind, but I personally prefer the creamier tahini heavy style of hummus. Ful - Kind of remind me of refried beans, which I'm not a huge fan of.Delicata squash - I was most excited about this dish but ended up being a dud. A bit too oily and didn't love the flavors (too sweet I think?). Also didn't expect it to be paired with half a plate of yogurt which my lactose intolerant self might have otherwise avoided. Samir's hand kneaded bread - Definitely very tasty but also soaked with oil on top so not the healthiest.Definitely want to come back at some point to try the mulabi!,Take out is the option until we get to eat at our favorite restaurants again. They had nice Euro style sidewalk dining here at the end of Fall , I hope it comes back in the Spring.My order this weekend was the Mezz Starter that was nicely packed , I get this in part because of my love of the Baba Ganoush (eggplant) which I some times also order instead solo when it's just myself. That said , I also prepared some Garlic Naan that I almost always have in my Freezer from TJ since I normally like a little more bread with this style of meal then what comes with the default order.For the mains , it was the Chicken Shish , and the Beef Kabob which comes with House Rice, Humus & Pita. The proteins are packed with flavor , as is the rice.They are located right in front of several major muni line , and parking might not be easy ," but I normally can get a space near the park when picking up my order.Very easy to recommend Beit Rima !""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Snug,"The Snug is a cozy spot with a pleasant ambiance and tasty cocktails. The only challenge is finding a spot to sit (or even stand) on a Friday or Saturday night. It gets pretty busy during peak hours, so you may want to get here early if you want to find a spot at the bar or at a table. Parking is tough, given the Snug's location in the Fillmore District. You're better off taking a cab and then strolling down Fillmore to other locations nearby. It's situated near other cool bars, and isn't too far from Japantown as well.,Quick update on the last postTry the chicken sandoReally good with some ranch dressing!,Wonderful service, everyone was super friendly and welcoming. Their snacks were all so delicious! The decor is quite pretty too-- just wish the ""snug"" booth was open when we got there because it looked super cozy.-Sesame naan and shiitake hummus-Tots-Crispy Delicata Squash-Popcorn chickenAll fantastic. Seriously, my mouth is watering just thinking bout them.Not sure how I feel about the 'fair wage surcharge in lieu of tipping' - maybe they should be getting a fair wage to begin with? I know, such a radical concept right,Came here on a Saturday evening after high recommendations, and could see (and taste) why the recommendation was given.Service and Staff:- Order via QR code on the tables- Some of the food was quick to come out (the easier foods to cook)- Drinks come out very quickly also Food and Drinks:- Nitro Margarita: delicious and does the job- Paloma Slushy: they mentioned the day we went was the last day for the slushies due to the weather changing- Spicy Fried Chicken Sandwich: ordered with tots and both were good. By no means the best fried chicken sandwich ever, but had good flavor - Squash Tempura: this was really delicious - would recommend ordering this.- Popcorn chicken: always a good hit, especially with the yuzu MayoMiscellaneous:- Indoor dining and outdoor parklet dining available- Typical SF availability for parking - Love that you can have your own tab from the QR code if you want (makes paying the bill easier at the end),Great outdoor table setup- all in individual booths. I like coming here for drinks or for a relaxing lunch or happy hour. They have a wide drink selection- from non alcoholic favorites like Arnold Palmer, to sparking wine, draft beer and cocktails. I like their fall salad- which was really delicious and filling: yellow and red beets with arugula, goat cheese, in a light vinaigrette dressing.,Saturday around 4pm rolled in to plenty of outdoor booths - heated, private little benches for your group. They band you after checking ID and everything is done online. From placing the order via phone to food & drinks coming out was super speedy and prompt. Was actually surprised at the speed. All of the drinks we tried were so yummy. The PB Milk Punch was a special hit for me - liquid peanut butter - YUM! Such a nice area to meet up and hang out with an awesome ambiance, food, and dranks.,Good burger!! Good Taylor tots too. The ambiance is great with the outdoor seating - dog friendly too. The outdoor dining has heaters above the tables so you don't get too cold. Service was through a QR code, but was relatively quick! We'd come back mainly for the vibes.,We called ahead of time to double check if they allow dogs and they did (because they have parklets and that's where we stayed). Never got to see the inside but the aesthetics of the restaurant looks cute. We over ordered the sides so we had way too many potatoes but it's all good. I ordered the wagyu burger and I can't believe I was gonna  love it.,I came here for happy hour with colleagues and we liked this spot. The location is also in a great neighborhood, Fillmore, with lots of shops and other places to eat and drink. The space is big and there's a few larger table that can seat 6 people so i would say it's good for groups. I ordered the double smash burger and I loved it. I also got the sesame naan shiitake hummus, I don't know if I'd order it again, it was only okay but I was excited to try it. I was also disappointed they didn't have any options for dessert. Overall, I would come back again and try some drinks next time.,Amazing cocktails and equally amazing food. Sneaky great spot for lunch if you work in walking distance, never too busy or loud in the afternoons. The staff here is super friendly and make killer cocktails. They have a large whiskey selection and other fun spirits. The food is a passion project from some amazing chefs and they over deliver in quality and taste.,I visited Snug for the first time this weekend for drinks after a walk at Alta Plaza Park and along Fillmore. They have great indoor and outdoor seating options. We sat inside, but had a great view that opened up to the street (perfect for dog watching). The cocktails were phenomenal, and I highly recommend the Bee's Knees if you are a fan of gin cocktails. This is such a cute area, and I'll be visiting again soon to try more drinks and the food!,Came here on a Saturday night with no reservation with a party of 5. They sat us at table that we had to share with a different party which I didn't like but we had no other choice so it was fine. Food 3/5: We got the buns which were really dry and the popcorn chicken which didn't really have any flavor and I don't think the yuzu Mayo went well with the chicken. The Brussels were okay and the tots were good. Overall it's not bad for bar food.Service 2/5: We scanned the barcode and ordered so we didn't really get great service. Someone literally just brought us what we ordered and that's it. And they charge mandatory 20% tip for really doing nothing! So that's why I'm giving this place a 2...to automatically charge 20% when we sat ourselves and ordered ourselves is drastic.,Friendly and fast service. The outdoor sidewalk booths are better than average. The QR ordering system is actually pretty convenient once you get used to it--you don't have to flag down a server to order another drink. The food is good. The bar gets a little crowded for my tastes, but this is a nice spot if you arrive early. There is an automatic 20% tip. It's not built into the prices, though. It's tacked on at the end.,Solid place for drinks and appetizers! We got the prickly pear and one of the frosés last time, and both were balanced and strong. Haven't had a chance to try too much of the food yet, but the popcorn chicken is excellent. Great, chill atmosphere for hanging out with friends or for date night.,Such a cute place to grab a drink, catch up with friends, or for a date night. I'm a sucker for the aesthetic and this place has it all. Cozy benches, floor to ceiling plants, large corner windows, modern lighting. I went there for a date around 7:30pm on Thursday. Even though it looked quite busy, we were seated immediately and given the option to sit at a bar-like seating near the windows, or at a table farther back in the bar. We opted for the window seating, which was honestly pretty fun to people watch on Fillmore st. It's loud inside, but not so loud that you can't hear the other person. Vibe note: we were surrounded by many many other couples in this corner. Guess everyone has the same idea?!The menu has a great selection, and I appreciated that there were actual food options versus just fries/chips. Ordering is done through QR code, a very smart idea. It made ordering drinks quick and easy. With so many people in the bar, I think it would've been a lot harder to flag down a waiter every time we wanted another drink. Would definitely go back again! Great drinks, friendly service, and a fun vibe.,Lovely spot on Fillmore St for a weekend brunch and people-watching! The shiitake hummus with crunchy garlic (?) on top was great. Super fast service.Dined: July 23, 2022,Great outdoor space in Filmore with heat lamps and contactless ordering and payment. It was perfect that I could scan the QR code to place my order, and the code is tied to the table I was sitting at so the servers knew where to bring out my food. It was also super helpful because I left my wallet at home, but know my credit card number so it made it very convenient. From ordering to delivery, the food was fairly quick. The portions are large. The one thing I would note is that the ambiance is casual, including service especially with their new set up. Personally, I don't mind, but some people may prefer more hands on service - if so, this likely isn't the spot for you. If you want good food, contactless service and payment, good casual vibes, then definitely check this place out.I had the wagyu burger and fries and thought it was tasty. The burger comes on a pretzel bun so it is different than traditional buns. Pretty good IMO, but they also have an impossible burger if you prefer vegan!,Pricy.20% tip automatically included Food was good. You get a good amount of fries when you add it to your burger.,Great place for a drink with your partner or group of friends! We ordered the Prickly Pear and Watermelon Rose, both of which were delicious. We also got the popcorn chicken, which we enjoyed as a side.The atmosphere is very cozy, not crazy loud inside. The host was very friendly and we had a wonderful night out!,Came on a Wednesday evening. Decently busy. No reservation and still sat us at a shared table. The menu is via a barcode you scan and order your food directly. No actual service other than someone bringing your food.We had the nitro margarita which was decent. They explicitly say that you can't modify (lol). We shared the mushroom hummus, Brussel sprouts, and pork buns. The mushroom hummus was delicious. The brussel sprouts were okay. And the pork buns were pretty dry but the flavor was good. Good food for a bar. Overall would def come back. However, not sure I'm a fan of the automatic 20% gratuity. Considering that there was no actual service...,Amazing atmosphere, good drinks, great for multiple occasions. Went for a birthday, they were able to accommodate the group without a wait and allowed us time to enjoy ourselves without being rushed out. Solid experience.,Great ambiance and cool interior! The aloe cocktail was really really good!! The chicken bites were also delicious. Would go again!,Great service, outdoor seating is also fantastic at night. Perfect place to grab drinks after dinner,Beef dip sandwich was delicious...beer was high quality and the service was so good.,I've walked by this spot hella times and finally got to try it this past week. Peeping the menu, it's got what I look for in any bar, burgers and craft cocktails.My night started off with the prickly pear cocktail, and it was super good! It had some habanero notes, and it was nice little touch of spicy without being overbearing. My 2nd round was an order of Pliney the elder, classic IPA, delicious. Beers will run you around $7-10, cocktails were $14-17, standard pricing for the area.For the food, we started off with Brussels sprouts, which were alright, slightly oily but no standout flavors. I also got a Wagyu double smash burger with tater tots and a side of ranch. I thought the burger patty tasted good, but wasn't a fan of the seeded bun which I think threw it off for me. It got soggy quick, and wish it was more toasted. I got a side of ranch, and it tasted funk. It reminded me of BKs or the Newman ranch which had a funky after taste. The tator tots itself were pretty good, perfectly fried and a generous portion. Burger and tots will run ya $17. Both of us got burgers and tots, but I think we would've been good with just one order of tots. When we got sat, they ask for your ID and proof of vaccination, then they'll give you a wristband so they know you've been checked. You'll order from the QR code, utilizing the TOAST tab. Service charge is automatically included onto the final total. You'll have to ask for water via the app, although I wish a carafe of water and a couple glasses were automatically brought to the table. We rolled in around 6pm and we were able to snag an outdoor table. I gotta say, they prolly have the nicest parklet on Fillmore. The seating is spacious and has a few tables that a perfect for groups up to 6. We were just two, and we appreciated all the space. The heater above the table is a nice touch, however you it's SF, if you coming at night, bring a jacket, it's always cold lol Overall, great ambiance both inside and out. I although I wasn't the biggest fan of the food, this still a solid place for cocktails with friends. Would definitely come back,Snug!  On Fillmore Street in Pacific Heights...Full bar and light menu... went in today for a drink and a snack after another hectic day of work.   Sat at the window and ordered with QR code... got the Tsar Nicoukai Trout Roe with Garlic  Naan !Order with QR code.  Nice staff.  Full bar.  Loved it!4 stars because I could not find my favorite food anymore on their menu and I went there just for it 7/1 update they took this off the menu  bring it back!!!!!,Came here for a nightcap after dinner! We got seated quickly but saw a long line pile up after us who had to wait for a while. They checked IDs and gave you wristbands which was kind of weird (and maybe wasteful?). We got 2 cocktails and 2 beers - which were all really yummy! My favorite was the Prickly Pear - not too sweet, interesting flavor, and had cacti pieces as garnish. We also ordered The Sour but wasn't as sour as I expected / preserved plum flavor was more muted. Overall, fun drinks and fun vibes!,Nothing to write home about, though the Pliny on tap is nice. 20% auto tip is fine if the service is good, however that's not the case here. You need to do all the work to order and pay online, then someone just brings out the drinks and goes on their way. No check to see if we'd like some water, have any questions on the menu, etc. Pretty insane to charge 20% for that.I recommend avoiding, so many other better options for cocktails in this city,Distinctive flavors without being overwhelming The snug hits that ""just right"" blend of tastes portion size and presentation with an unpretentious vibe Had a nice lunch in their parklet tables which allowed for people watching during the busy pre holiday shopping Fun for the whole family,Came here for drinks on a Saturday night and it was not crowded. Parking was plentiful. We had the option of sitting upstairs, at the bar, or near the window. We sat at the bar and ordered with the bartender instead of using the QR code. Good place for a small groups. FYI - They charge an automatic 20% ""fair wage surcharge in lieu of tipping"",Nice spot that would be perfect for a happy hour after work, or a casual date night. I love that the Snug uses an app to order drinks/food as well as close out the tab. Although that part is automated, the staff was still extremely accommodating and available. We got a few apps, french fries, tots and brusel sprouts. The french fries were a little undercooked, but the tots and sprouts were delicious. I highly recommend getting the aoli (although maybe not worth a dollar), it was delightful!Worth checking out The Snug!,The best cocktails in the city. Every time I go here with friends and family I have them try to aloe Vera drink and everyone's mind is blown. The brunch there is also amazing. They have a French toast that will make you wish you can have it everyday,We came here for a quick bite to eat before we had to head to an event, very cute restaurant and ambiance was nice and hostess was very helpful!There are QR code's on the sides of the table, each person scans and can order their own meal and pay for their own meal right from your phone, makes it great for if you need to split checks. It sends the order straight to the kitchen as well. We honestly weren't too impressed with the quality of the food. We ordered a few salads, a burger, hummus, and popcorn chicken. The quality of the chicken did not taste that good at all. The salads were tasty but we wish we didn't get grilled chicken on them. Hummus was probably my favorite thing with the naan bread! My brother got the burger and said it was good! I'll have to give it another try.,Milk Punch review: Peanut Butter Milk Punch: Scotch, rum, banana, peanut, lime I tried to experiment with a peanut butter milk punch. I tried to take the easy route and use something off the shelf to impart the peanut butter flavor. Namely the Skrewball whisky I saw at the store. Bad decision. But this milk punch was excellent. Just enough nutty flavor. It's a different nutt-iness than a nocino walnut liqueur. Now I'm gonna have to re-experiment with peanut butter again. This was lovely and I hope it remains a staple on the menu.,While traveling in San Francisco, I was very hungry and came here, I was immediately captivated by the burger and salad from the menu.And if you came with friends, you can order beer and have a good time.Despite that, I always prefer a cocktail to a beer,I really like the vibe -- very modern and rustic. Seems like a great place for a 20's-30's crowd. My family and I sat at an outdoor table and on a cold Friday evening the heat lamp barely radiated towards us. It was on, it just didn't have a far reach. The food was okay -- for the price I felt it lacked in taste and portion. But they had some good side sauces.,The snug is a cute spot and versatile. It's a place to meet up with friends, coworkers, or even a date. They have delicious cocktails, in particular, I like their whiskey sour which is made with egg whites. They have some fun food options to share as well like nacho tots and popcorn chicken with yuzu mayo. For dinner once I had their watermelon feta salad which was so refreshing. Also during San Francisco beer week this was one of the only locations serving pliny the younger beer later on in the week (hot tip). On the downside this place can be really crowded and can get a bit louder as the evening progresses making it harder to grab a table. To solve this they have opened up outdoor seating. You can also grab a drink at the bar in the standing room section as you wait for a table to open up. Service is pretty quick too! This bar/restaurant is located off of fillmore and you can find some parking in the neighborhoods just be careful to check the street signs.,I came for brunch and I loved this place! I had the impossible burger and it was so flavorful! This place is like nothing I've ever experienced, you basically order via your phone and it's so convenient, want water? Order on your phone. Want ranch? Order on your phone. They also automatically add 20% in lieu of tip. Highly recommend checking place out, my friends and I enjoyed everything on the menu.,Food was good, if a little overpriced. If I could order to go I would, but I won't be eating here again. The reason is there is no service. You seat yourself, scan a barcode, order and pay on an app. I should note that you can not ask questions of anyone or modify an order. Want your $17 burger rare or well done? Too bad- ""all burgers cooked to medium, no substitutions"". You will be charged a 20% service charge regardless. I had two (kegged , pre made) cocktails and a burger and fries (+$4 for fries) for which I was charged $48. Then they added a $9.60 automated gratuity...for someone to run food. I really hope this all goes to the kitchen who are the real (only) stars. I want employees to be well compensated, but this is too much for me.,Oh yes, this is a wonderful place, I was once in this attractive, beautiful, cozy, inviting delicious food, fresh drinks, spacious interior and clean air that beckons me again and again, I really like the popcorn chicken a delicate taste and is very nutritious, exceptional freshness gives a light sweet aftertaste and every bite is worth savoring it with your eyes closed, definitely coming back.,April 2, 2021 COVID We came here for a nice drink and eats after a beautiful hike. Well it's covid so we didn't know what to expect! We walked up and were told you can order at the window but if you're dining In we could pick a spot and use the WR code to check out the menu. We ordered directly from the menu - 2 drinks - Wagyu Burger - Kale Salad  Total : $75 after tip etc  I was impressed with the 10/10 quality I got on the drinks and for that I will be back!,The drinks and vibes were amazing here, but the food is just slightly lackluster. We got an assortment of dishes which were all tasty and went well with drinks, but not particularly amazing. I would say that the veg options are done quite well and highly recommend the Brussels sprouts and elote. The ordering process through the website is very easy, but if you're on the second floor, it's a bit hard to get a hold of servers.,The food is top-notch, and the staff has top-notch service skills.We find coming to the Snug is after work.It's a wonderful environment overall.,yeah slayed. nice burgers for a not too bad price; the yuzu mayonnaise was suprisinglt flavorful and worth trying. The frozen cosmopolitan said hi hello! Great.,Great service. Great food and drinks. Great atmosphere both indoors and outdoors. I will definitely return!,This place is super cute for a quick drink with apps or casual date night. Drinks are great, food is above average & the outdoor parklet tables are super cozy even on cold nights. Only negative feedback is we didn't get our silverware and side plates until we were halfway done picking through the meal. Other than that the people working are generally friendly.,I came here today and had an awesome time! We sat at the bar and ordered 4 drinks and fried chicken through the QR code. The food and drinks came out fast. The Paper Plans and Chamomile Cooler were some of my favorites! The chicken came with a delicious dipping sauce and was the perfect bar food. The bartender was friendly and super amazing, and all the staff was awesome too. I definitely would go back!,The drinks were ok. What I didn't like at all was the way they bill. You order and pay your food/drinks through their website portal. And when they bill you through the portal, there's a 20% requiered tip. You can't edit it the tip line. I don't like to be forced to pay a required tip. I want to tip what I want to tip. I will not come back to this place until they change this.Response to Snug's General M. post answering my post: Hello General M., thank you for addressing my comment. I read the policy you refered too. Even though it's elegantly crafted and full of nice sounding buzz words, I am not convinced at all. If snug SF it's so concerned about its employee's wages, you should raise their pay, and consequently raise the prices of your drinks and food. A hidden 20% mandatory tip (effectively a 20 % snug tax) is a specious way to get more money from us without increasing your prices.,Been here a few times over the pandemic and unfortunately it doesn't seem like it's been too kind to them. Sad to see what used to be the #1 happy hour spot pivot so much, but such is the way when an entire restaurant industry get's screwed over by our lovely SF nanny state. The menu went from elevated/unique bar food, to now just bar food. The tots used to be served with this crazy good foam, bacon fits, and green onions - now they come with ketchup. The burger used to be a heavenly chopped cheese (never see that on the west coast!) on a perfectly tender torpedo roll - now it's an under-seared 'wagyu' smashburger on a commodity sesame bun. The drinks were also pre-mixed and very weak when I was there - hopefully now that they are reopened as a bar it is back to a real cocktail.Loved this spot and I hope 2022 is kind to them where they can find their stride again as a standout creative bar. They were the True Laurel for Pac Heights at one point, but sadly no more.,Have been wanting to come here for the longest time but either the wait it too long or they're closed. Finally made it and was worth the wait. Tried prickly pear for my drink. Soooooo good! Want to go back for more cocktails for sure!! Went with the tomato burrata salad with pesto. Very good as well. Would totally commmmeee back!!,We stopped in here for a light dinner and drinks before a show at the Fillmore a few weeks back.  It's a cool neighborhood spot with a lot of different options for drinks.  We ordered Brussel Sprouts, Sweet Potato tacos, and the Winter Salad; all were great.The one downside - and maybe it was because SF Beer Week - was that they were out of most of their beer that was on the menu.  The food and friendly bartenders made up for it.Not sure I'd go out of my way to come back here, but would certainly not hesitate if I'm in the area.,My friend and I were walking around Fillmore and stopped in at The snug for a snack. I hadn't been here before but was impressed by the amount of outdoor seating which is quite spacious and comfortable which you don't find at a lot of restaurants. For outdoor seating, they have long tables with benches that are enclosed and separated from other tables; these could seat up to 8 (maybe 10?) people. There are also smaller two-person tables on the sidewalk. When we arrived, seating was plentiful, and we got a larger table. The signs on the table say to check in with the hostess before seating yourself...but when we went into the restaurant to ask for a table, she just said to grab one (and people were doing that all around us). We ordered the tater tots and the popcorn chicken - both super tasty bar snacks. There were lots of other tempting menu items but perhaps another time. They have online ordering, and I love it. Some people find it impersonal, but I think it's super efficient since I can see the menu as soon as I sit down, can order more items when I want them and can check out without having to flag down a server for my bill. One thing to note is that none of the staff were wearing masks. The mask mandate is over, but the staff at most establishments I've been to continue to wear masks.,Special shout-out to the entire staff working on Sat afternoon. Everyone was kind, patient, and extremely gracious. As businesses work to rebuild after last year, there are ample reasons for service to not go as desired, but this staff made every effort to make sure our visit was enjoyable, (and they succeeded). Many many thanks!!,Delicious drinks and a pleasant experience overall.  Reservations were easy.  The spicy chicken sandwich is also good.  Fillmore is also a nice street to visit.,Really enjoyed our visit here - the bar inside is beautiful and immaculate. They're doing contactless ordering so you scan a QR code once seated and can add food as you please and check out and leave whenever you're ready, no waiting for a server to pass by with the check. I liked that the parklet offered shaded seating with barriers between each party. The restaurant is on a slope, just FYI. Parking is tough but that should be expected - it's the best street with tons of shops and restaurants. I would love to see a few more food options - our burger was really good but it didn't feel like a full menu, this place is more focused on the cocktails (which looked good and pic-worthy).,Blow away by: 1. Covid response. Fully digital menu, ordering, and payment. You never actually interact with a waiter - other than when the food is ""dropped"" over2. Allergy menu! Let's go! Awesome to see esp. with no waiter contact. 3. Awesome location in Fillmore with lively environment. Eh: 1. Spicy Fried chicken sandwich was only alright. Was definitely crispy but mine had a big piece of skin on it which got chewy as the sandwich cooked down. Also felt like the sandwich was missing cheese, or another topping of sort. Also - not spicy (but I was also not looking for a jalapeño spicy, wanted more of that deep spice) 2. 20% gratuity and fees is pretty steep - especially when there's no server... Great for: First date or big groups where you don't want to deal with sharing the check! Check out platform let's you order individually.,Drinks were absolutely delicious and the staff was very nice. Food was a little funky but overall tasty. The burger patty itself was very high quality but unfortunately was overpowered by the plasticity of the American cheese they use.,Weird choice my boyfriend and I made by coming here lmao. No real service, order everything yourself by QR code and automatic 20% tip. Being a server in the industry myself i gotta ask how does one land a job at this place? All jokes aside, I understand we're coming from tough times but from a guest standpoint it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Especially when the food isn't that good (popcorn chicken, other stuff I cant remember) the drinks are average. Don't think I'd come back,Great fried chicken sandwich with tots and cocktails. One of the best chill bars on Fillmore,The bartenders were super friendly and chill. The food options were a bit limited, but ok. Would come back for their cocktails.,We have been coming here for many years,including support during COVID.  We go back the food is good and service used to be excellent.  The food is ok but the service is horrible.  They now gave a mandatory tip of 20% so they really don't have to care.  It is now mostly a bar that serves some food, is our last time, don't need our business!!!,This is one of my new favorite places in the city. We tried going here a couple weeks before and the wait was over an hour, so we went early around 5 on a Friday and the wait was only 20 minutes.I'd say this place is more snacks and drinks rather than for dinner, but what they do have they do perfectly! We both got the prickly pear mezcal drink, and agreed it was one of the best and most interesting cocktails we've ever had. Even for people who don't like mezcal, it wasn't an overpowering smoky flavor like most are. We also got the hummus and naan bread, and that was delicious as well. It's not cheap, one drink came out to be ~$18 with tax and their service fee (the charge instead of tip), but I definitely think you get what you pay for in quality. Cant wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!,I tried this place after work Friday evening. The hostess was really nice and welcoming I was alone so I sat at he bar. The hostess was the nicest person I interacted during my visit. My first drink was amazing I ordered an old fashioned and pork belly. The food was good. I ordered a second drink and different bartender made it, I was not able to finish it the taste was horrible. I won't let that keep me from coming back.,We came to the Snug on a Friday night for drinks and light dinner. The hostess sat us right away, checked our ID and informed us of the 20% tipping practice. Which was fine except that the ordering and paying were done directly from the phone. The drinks came out quickly and so did the food. We order Brussels sprouts, chicken sandwich with tots- the Brussels sprouts were ok and the chicken sandwich looks sad. Every little thing you want cost extra - even the honey mustard- and the ketchup we ordered never arrived even after informing the hostess. Waiters were no where insight nor available beyond dropping off our foods. I'd would not recommend coming here for food- perhaps here for the drinks. They were good. Not worth the price and service judging from the quality of food and (lack of) service received.,This place is great and lives up to all of the good reviews it has received! We were surprised that we got a table for two fairly quickly (under ~10 min), but I could see this place being a long wait. Once seated, they handle everything through a QR code. You can order and pay through the mobile functionality. From there, the food and drinks come out pretty fast so no complaints there. They have an expansive drink selection with lots of delicious cocktails. We got the nitro margarita and the Prickly Pear mezcal and loved both of those drinks. They also have Pliny the Elder on tap! +1 for that alone.The food is pretty great as well. We ordered the crispy asparagus and the eggplant katsu. The crispy asparagus were fried to perfection and came with this aioli dip that was out of this world! The real star of the show was the eggplant katsu, this is The Snug's take on the normal chicken katsu dish, but vegetarian. They use eggplant in lieu of the chicken and it is perfectly breaded. It's superb and worth the trip alone!Now that I know how good The Snug is, I will definitely return.,This place was a wonderful, came here Sunday morning with some friends. The drinks has a refreshing flavor that's a good drink for brunch, the avocado toast was solid, delicious and satisfying so pairing that for a more healthier option like the tomato salad was cool. I definitely wanted to tried the W",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gyu burger but I controlled the urge. The service was attentive and not too overshadowing. I'll definitely be back to try that Wagyu burger.,We had such a great time doing our brunch aft The Snug. It's very lovely place, and with the outdoor setting it was just perfect for the bar try out, somesnacks and good company on Tuesday.Wagyu Burger came with fries (photo with just fries because it was too delicious to be waiting)Meat was soft and juicy, fries were salty enough for my taste, some crispy, some soft (team soft here).Drinks were - g r e a t, we've tried couple of coctails and we will for sure be back for it.great experience.,First place I've gotten to eat at since SIP! Was in the neighborhood for salt and straw and saw this place had outdoor seating so decided to give it a try. My boyfriend got the popcorn chicken and I got the fried chicken sandwich. Both the popcorn chicken and chicken on the sandwich were super good. Chicken was nice and crunchy how I like it. The chicken sandwich was pretty small though given the price. I believe it was $14 and I felt like it was gone within 4 bites. It also came with a side of tots which always pairs well with a nice cold beer! They also had a variety of drinks that you can choose from - we kept it basic with the hazy IPA. Overall sanitation wise it seemed clean, I saw them sanitizing tables and the countertop to the cashier several times as we were eating. I only dock a star for the small portioned chicken sandwich.,They seem pretty understaffed. It vibes like a classy bar/restaurant, but you order off QR codes and no one checks in to see if you have what you need. That wouldn't be a big deal but the restaurant automatically charges a 20% tip, so you're paying for the cost of a sit down restaurant for...not that.The QR code is buggy and limited -- we ordered waters and never got them, couldn't order a simple whisky on the rocks through the app, etc. We had to get up to go to the bar many times to get what we needed. The bathroom was a mess. But the employees were nice and the margarita was good!,Went there on a Wednesday night with some friends and the ambiance is no nice. There is a bar, there is music there are people chatting and laughing, it's super happy and lively. They have a very different good ordering system where you scan a QR code, place your order online and close your tab when you are ready. I absolutely loved the concept, it's so much easier and everyone has free agency over their order. Only problem was that my phone was almost dead. Yikes!Now the food. I got the wagyu burger which was a good burger,  not much to say here. They say they cook all burgers medium but mine was definitely well done - no pink. But it was juicy and tasty. I added a side of their special mayo and it was delicious. For drink I got the prickly pear, it was nice and sweet like I like it with a strong smoky flavor. I would definitely get it again. My friend got the aloe which I tried and it was also super good. Less sweet but more refreshing.,SO good! We are always pleased when we come here for date night. The cocktails are creative.,If you can get Leah (spelling?) as your bartender, she's as gorgeous as she is as amazing as a bartender. Amazing Peanut Butter Milk Punch and my friend loved his Manhattan. The smash burger was also excellent! Definitely a relaxed vibe that I would recommend.,Fantastic craft cocktails! The Aloe one is great. Amazing service," the bar tenders were super friendly and outgoing. My only issue is the Toasttab platform they make you order on. It charges you a """"service fee"""" which is a % of your bill and it's unclear", does this go to the staff or the platform? I also forgot to close out my tab, and they must have done it for me, which means I left no tip ( I felt so bad). I tried to find a number to call and ask if I could correct it and leave a tip but they don't have their number listed anywhere? Summary great drinks, not so great ordering app experience.,20% mandatory gratuity with 0% of welcoming, attentive service. This coming from a service industry veteran who's worked in both SF and NYC from the gamut of brewpubs to Michelin Star restaurants... If you charge customers automatic gratuity on the basis that you care about your workers, management, then build it into the prices and pay them more yourself. Or set up a system that actually delivers 20% gratuity-worthy service. Combined with so/so food and drinks, this cringe-y approach loses you a hefty swath of would-be regulars, imo.,Stopped here on 12/17 for a quick glass of wine before watching my friends kid in the SF Boys Choir. Had 30 minutes and the place was 1/3 full. Sat at the bar while the bartender was making drinks right in front of me. I had my credit card visible and was looking at him. He hadn't acknowledged me when about 5 minutes later he asked if I knew that I was supposed to order through a QR code on the edge of the bar...no I didn't, would have been helpful to have mentioned that when I first walked up and was looking at him card in hand. I've never been a fan of not being acknowledged," an """"I'll be with you in a minute goes a long way"""" to saying """"I see you.""""  So we put in an order for 2 glasses of wine from a tap. I did mention that we had a show to get to. After 10 minutes I asked him if it was possible to cancel the order as we weren't going to have enough time. He commented that since it was just 2 glasses of wine he could pour them. It was supposed to be a 6oz pour", it wasn't. We gulped down the mediocre wine, paid $36 through the app and left. Won't be back. He wasn't rude, but for $18 glasses of not great wine there are many other options,Went in on a Saturday night for a date and it was really chill at first. It was quiet enough that we could hear each other. The bartender was a little slow. As the night went on, this obnoxiously loud and drunk group came in. The atmosphere immediately changed. This group was so drunk, they couldn't function, but they were still being served. They all seemed like friends, but then the guys in the group started to yell and cuss at each other, getting ready to fight. The group then loitered directly outside and my date and I felt unsafe walking to our cars. This place needs a bouncer.,Twas a cold San Francisco eve. A friend was in from NYC and we wanted a drink, and maybe some eats. Where to? Snug. And we were snug as three bugs at an outdoor table with heat. They have a lovely beer and cocktail selection, as well as a menu full of delights. We enjoyed a kale caesar and a smash burger (no idea what smash means but it was smashingly good). Food prices are a tad high, but what the heck. A good night was had and I look forward to coming back again. Note: If you sit outside you order online from the table vs. having table service.,On the corner with nice windows. Orders through QR codes. Space is inviting and fairly casual inside. Cocktail more expensive than its quality warranted. Probably wouldn't come back,We came here at 9:55pm just before the kitchen closed. We've been asked to order food right away, as the kitchen closes at 10pm. We placed our order and waited at the table. The food and cocktails which was mediocre at best was served after 15-20 minutes. We were missing one dish, which we assumed since it wasn't an appetizer would take more time to get to the table. It didn't around 10:30pm I approached the hostess that took the reservation and asked her where is the dish (chicken sandwich) - she said that was never ordered. Both me and my gf, specifically remembered that we did. No apology was made, and the attitude was dismissive. When the manager approached us about an hour later, we described what happened. He started babbling for 20 minutes how the sandwich was great, and why the cocktails that were too sweet (despite specifically asking if they are before we ordered them) was our own subjective taste (which is of course true). Instead of trying to mansplain us why it's not their fault," the easiest thing would be to simply ask """"how can make this better for you?"""" I assume every one would have a different answer", but actually allow to give a second chance. That question was never asked. There will be no second chance, despite the gesture to take the cocktails off the bill.,The snug is really popular bar - wait times are ~1hr even though they have lots of outdoor seating tables. Ordering is quick and easy with a QR code that you order from and pay upfront. They serve both cold and warm cocktails, perfect for chilly nights. I would highly recommend ordering the pork belly baos too, as they were some of the best I've ever had. Pork is a thick, generous slice and the smoky flavor is amazing.,I came here for a massage. I had an appointment for 4:30pm. But I must have somehow gotten my wires crossed, because it turns out this isn't a massage store but a cocktail store. No problem: like the great mate Jimmy Buffett said," """"Adjust the sails."""" So I tacked the vessel and switched my schedule from a massage appointment to an alcoholic beverage appointment.I got the Schlitz Cocktail and it was delectable.",I've been here several times, but most recently I celebrated here on the last night before the outdoor dining was once again shut down for COVID. This was one of the only bars available for walk-ins (every other place was already booked with appointments) - and therefore, we found great parking, checked in with the hostess, and were seated right away in their new parklet with roof! My husband and I went a little crazy with their Spiced Coconut Daiquiris and Strawberry Basil cocktails. Basically with the new outdoor seating, you order from the QRC code posted at your table, and order directly from that, and the drinks will be delivered straight to your table. It worked pretty nicely - although I wish there was an option for keeping the tab open," so I wouldn't have 3 rounds of """"The Snug"""" sitting in my credit card statement. The drinks were fantastic....better than I remember from regular times pre-covid. I liked their outdoor parklet seating they created. The benches", chairs and tables felt very real, like you were actually eating at a restaurant that was meant for outdoor dining. The maximized their space by having plexiglass between tables, which was done well, and felt very safe. It also blocked out the wind, and in the middle of winter, didn't feel as cold as it could be. They also had larger tables for people socializing with others outside their household and not taking the pandemic seriously. The customer service was excellent. We had ordered our 3rd round of drinks, and this round was taking longer than usual. We flagged down the hostess, who said she'd check on our order. Turns out after lots of mystery solving, there was some glitch in their system where our order got lost. They felt super bad, and gave us 2 free shots of Tequila in addition to our 3rd round of cocktails!!! So nice. We also liked the communication style of the hostess, who was very straightforward and transparent. Isn't that always what we want from people?Can't wait for them to open up again!!,BRUNCH Came here with a group of 7 people and we were seated in a reserved back room upstairs. It was the perfect space for the loud crew. FOODMenu was surprisingly short in selections but varied enough that every one could choose something.         The Burger - absolutely amazing and tasty. Made to perfection and a beautiful combination of flavors.          The kale salad - refreshing but you definitely need the protein added otherwise it tastes like it is missing something.          French toast - tasty but not remarkable.           The Sugar & Cinnamon naan bread with yogurt and pistachio -- oh my goodness. I wiped the plate clean. So so delicious. The naan tasted fresh.             Avocado toast - looked heart and had beautiful presentation. I didn't taste it but all my friends gave it a thumbs up. SERVICE Impeccable and friendly.,"I came in with an old friend for Sunday brunch. We were sat immediately at the upper floor """"bar"""" of the restaurant which overlooks it all. The interior decor is gorgeous and it's a great place to people watch and sit with a date. We began by ordering breakfast cocktails (I didn't even know that was a thing", but if it's socially acceptable to drink in the morning, then I'm all for it). I ordered a raspberry fizz cocktail that was beautiful! It was topped off with a whipped merengue to imitate whipped cream. The flavor was good but it didn't have a lot of alcohol until I hit the bottom. It seemed like this drink was created more so for the image, rather than the taste.My drink was pretty pricey so I ordered the cheapest thing on the menu - Alice's Cinnamon and Sugar Naan ($9). I've only ever had naan bread in Indian restaurants so I was curious how this would play out into a brunch item. Let me tell you, it was delicious! I finished everything on my plate. I had an amazing brunch, on my end. My friend was not as fortunate. She ordered the Egg's Benedict which was $17. She told me it was really not that great and after trying it, I agreed. The hollandaise tasted distinctly sour like vinegar. I think the food and drinks here are a bit overpriced and very photograph worthy. Service is friendly but not outstanding. I would definitely come back for the sugar naan but not for the eggs Benedict. However, I'm excited to try the seasonal brunch specials as I believe they change every season!,Excellent!! Got to go. Nearly everything is good. Drinks are awesome too. Get the Ginger Pear seltzer.,So this is kinda like a bar with better food from tater tots to squash blossom tacos.  Want a pour of Pappy with that? Sure.  It's nice enough if you think of it as a better bar.  All the food kinda came out cold (aside from the tots which were on point).  Well good props here for following COVID protocols...as much as I hate the impersonal service of things being dropped of by QR codes...it's pretty smooth here but the heat lamps in the outdoor booth are pretty weak so bundle up, you will get as cold as the food.,Best cocktail in the city?? The food was great too. Couldn't recommend this place enough S/o Von, one of the best in business rn,Cool place, nice atmosphere! I love coming here with friends. If there are free places outside, I eat there. I usually take salads or french fries. Good place to eat after a walk in the nearby park.,Went here for dinner last night and got a burger and asked for onions on the side and the waiter said they didn't have onions. Friend ordered a salad and there were onions in the salad. Told the waiter hey man you lied to me you guys have onions and he said oh what I meant was we don't give side orders. I don't really feel like giving me a side of onions would've been that hard especially if they're already chopped up for salads? Burger tasted pretty dry due to lack of veggies. Also don't like the fact that the waiter lied to me upfront.The kicker was they charged me a 20% tip automatically. Never coming here again.,The kale salad is out-of-this world and the lox sandwich was so tasty generous on the lox. The homemade pickles were also great. Both non-alcoholic drinks we ordered (cold brew on tap and gingerale) were outstanding. I would come back in a heartbeat!They have a really nice parklet for outdoor dining on Fillmore street. The whole operation is nearly contact-free and feels like they have taken COVID-related health precautions very seriously. The parklet has separated booths constructed from plexiglass and wood, and you scan a QR code that links to your table to order your food. You can tell that The Snug has put in a huge effort to adapt to the current situation and I hope they can keep rocking!Their food was uniformly outstanding and I can't wait to come back and try some of their drinks.,I've been a huge fan of The Snug for years now. The cocktails are so creative and the outdoor dining is very spacious. The ambiance is great, all while feeling very safe/clean. My boyfriend regularly orders the burger + tots and says it's one of his favorites in all of SF. I've stolen a few tots off his plate (lol) and can confirm they are DELISH! They're always piping hot too. I personally love their salad options. I add chicken to mine (you can pick between grilled and crispy) and find that the portions are quite large. The salads make a great to-go meal too since they're not messy to eat. Overall, this is a great date spot, or perfect for an evening with friends too. Truly one of my favorite restaurants on Fillmore street.,I went here for drinks and dinner with my friends and we had a great experience! We were sat pretty quickly at a bar facing a window that looked out into the street and sidewalk. The ambiance is modern, cozy, casual and comfortable. The restaurant is in a great location.We were greeted pretty quickly and they took our order for drinks. For dinner, I ordered the roasted half chicken with a beer brine, marble potatoes, and mustard chimichurri. This entree did not disappoint! It was a very generous portion and the chicken was flavorful, moist, and tender. The potatoes were cooked to perfection and served with a salad on top that was fresh and tasty. Normally, I'm not a huge fan of mustard, but I couldn't get enough of the mustard chimichurri sauce! I put it all over my chicken and even dipped my potatoes in it and it was delicious. Super savory and flavorful. The service was very friendly and the food came out in a reasonable time. It is a bit on the pricier side but the food and drinks are great quality. We had a few friends come to join us there after my friend and I were finished with our dinner. They were really good about accommodating our suddenly larger party at a different table and we continued to get drinks and appetizers there at the larger table. Service continued to be great and friendly! Overall, great location and ambiance, yummy food, a bit pricey but great quality, and friendly and prompt service. I would definitely come back!,Had a surprisingly wonderful lunch yesterday. I highly recommend the Trout Roe and Nann, and am hoping enough people order it so it is not removed from the menu. Sure, caviar is more expensive than hummus, but this is reasonably priced for what it is and it is so worth it. We also had the Pork Belly Buns which were meaty and satisfying, and the winter salad, which was fresh and bright (and a large serving). The burger a couple tables over also looked really tasty.In addition to the excellent food, the COVID setup is the best I've seen (although I haven't eaten out much recently). Very low interaction with the staff, plex between the outside booths, and a heater for every table.,I went there thinking the food would be good and the people nice. All of that turned out to be true. They also have an ingenious ordering system. It requires a phone, but it's very convenient.What made the experience nothing short of unbearable for me is how loud the place was. I was on the terrace. It was calm. It was quiet. There was a wonderful view on Fillmore. And then, there were speakers over my head blaring the most horrible sound possible at an insanely high volume for no understandable reason.All that was needed to make the experience nice as opposed to excruciating was not to do that. The Brussels sprouts were just great, so I can't give the place less than four stars. But I ran away as quickly as I could.,I ended up meeting some friends while visiting SF & they suggested we meet here. Coming into the restaurant/bar they check ID's it's not a lounge? So not really sure why they checked but oh well they do have a decent bar area. Once inside we waited a few minutes for our table, we were seated upstairs.  Drinks I went with some Rose wine this was good, my company had beer good as well. Appetizers we gave the Avocado toast a try very good & the Wings nice taste good sauce. Main dish we shared the Pasta , this was really good with some bacon &  cheese I could do with out the peas didn't really add anything to the dish. Restaurant itself is nice two levels of seating... service was good prices are on the high side, overall enjoyed our meal.,A couple friends and I decided to come for lunch last weekend and was so happy to see there was no wait! We all ordered a round of drinks, which were all really, really good (I ordered a Bloody Mary!) For food, I ordered the Spicy Fried Chicken Sandwich and split an order of tots with the table. The sandwich.. I have thoughts. It came out and I was so excited. It looked so big and crispy! I bit into it and the fried chicken literally cut the side of my mouth. Not the chickens fault, but I've also never had that happen before... And onto the chicken... it was not spicy or seasoned. 2 of my other friends also got the same thing and we all agreed there was literally no flavor. Super disappointed,Cute spot on the Fillmore! Spacious outdoor seating for drinks and bites.Contactless ordering and payment through QR code once at a table. Fast service and lots of seating. 2-3 people seats along the restaurant wall with overhead heat lamps and tables for 6-8?  Dog friendly (: Food: delicious! Ordered the popcorn chicken with yuzu sauce (super moist and large pieces) and fries (can't go wrong) - would want to try the sesame naan and Brussels sprouts next time!Drinks: old fashioned, Manhattan, 2 IPAs. All solid.,I stopped by for a weekend lunch for the first time since before COVID - Menu has definitely changed (understandably) since my last visit, but I was impressed by how well they've adjusted to COVID times. The outdoor dining parklet area is very well done, and they clearly invested some money into building out an area that's both cute and functional. There were a variety of table sizes with actual benches and high plexiglass dividers between parties, and there were also additional tables/chairs along the sidewalk. The experience has pretty much shifted to nearly entirely contact-free. Instead of physical menus and ordering with a server, all of this was done via  a QR code that took you to a page where you could order everything from your food, drinks (including water), and utensil sets. There's a lot more food that's clearly meant to be complimentary to drinking alcohol (more so than pre-pandemic), but everything was delicious as always.,Whenever I'm on Fillmore I always walk by and have been wanting to stop by! Came around 8pm on a weeknight with 4 friends and waited about 15-20 minutes for a communal table. My friend and I split the Shrimp and Pork Fusilli ($26) and honestly was kind of disappointed. I felt that the fusilli was a bit too hard for my taste, while the pork was undercooked and super fatty. I also could not taste the miso butter which was what originally drew me to the dish. My friends ordered the Korean Fried Chicken Wings ($22 for the large- about 11 wings). It smelled super good and had a good crunch! They also got the Charcuterie & Cheese Board ($20), which came with a good amount of bread, but the cheese and meat options were kind of sad. The cheese looked packaged and there was only type of meat and some small pickles with mustard. It would have been nice if it had a wider selection or at least fig/honey. One friend also got the beer and a shot ($10), which he said they didn't even fill his shot fully (looked like half filled, but I guess for the price). The Marigold cocktail ($13) was super good, could not taste the alcohol at all! Tasted like a lemonade with honey and cane with a cute flower!! My other friend got the Prickly Pear ($14) that she said was good. Overall, while service was ok, the food unfortunately fell short of my expectations. I would consider trying brunch here instead, but probably not dinner again.,Sat at the bar, lots of inter- employee gossiping and running around. Happy hour? No. Everything just seemed rushed when really it wasn't that busy (I was the only person at the bar!) had a decent glass of rose and some corn  (1) ordered a burger and salad to-go, food was ok corn was over cooked but the best thing....,beware the 20% autograt," I walked out of there with a $70 check for subpar and unwelcoming service.....aka The Snub !""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
KAIYŌ Rooftop,"My wife and I stopped by here before heading to dinner and really enjoyed the experience.  You get a great view of the downtown skyline and even a view of the Bay Bridge.  We got lucky getting upstairs without a reservation, even if you are coming for just drinks I would recommend snagging a reservation as we were told that we would be the last walk ups let upstairs and it was only 7:30 PM.  My wife ordered the Super Saiyan and I had the Sailor Pluto.  Both drinks were delicious.  I particularly liked the Sailor Pluto which was their in house spin on a Pisco Sour.  The Sailor Pluto had a very strong smokey flavor and would not be for the faint of heart but if you are a mezcal lover I would highly recommend it.,I visited Kaiyo Rooftop when it was viral on social media. It is located in Mission Bay super close to the Giants stadium.Hidden inside a hotel, we got guided to the elevator by a really kind bellman. He took us up to the restaurant and although we had a reservation, we waited around 15 minutes before getting sat. Although it was mid-day, the roof is a lot colder so bring a jacket!To get sat, you need a reservation. If you want to just drinks, you can feel free to just head straight to the bar. One thing I would note is we could not see the view from the table. All the bar-goers stood around and close to our table, making it hard to hear and completely blocking the view. There was a tad too many people to truly enjoy the experience.I think the food was quite good and comparable to other Peruvian spots in the city. The ceviche is fresh, sushi rolls delicious, and I would order my drink again. I would note it is a bite pricey since my friend and I spent almost as much as we would omakase for 1/2 the quality of the fish.While I think it was a cool experience, I hope to give it another try when it is less crowded or at night time instead.,have a drink, enjoy the great view.don't buy any food!!spent $300 for i round of drinks and several ""bites"" and they are bites... you will leave hungry and disappointed  at the mediocre food.i feel bad for my friends who paid for this $$$$$ birthday lunch.oh don't go on a game day if you don't want a bunch of screaming sports fans..,I recommend making a reservation in advance! You can't order food as a walk-in. The service was exemplary! They accommodated us well and helped us find the warmest seat on the rooftop on a very windy night! We ordered the bluefin tuna toast and the lomo staltado roll. - Bluefin tuna toast: delicious! My friend loved this. She still raves about it and tells everyone who goes to Kaiyo to order it! I also enjoyed it, the rice toast was crispy, and the tuna was fresh! I will order again. - Lomo soltado roll (not pictured): so good! It was my first time trying sushi with meat, and I was pleasantly surprised. A mix of tangy and savory. I would order something different next time, but it was good if you wanted something different! The cocktails were delicious. I got the space adventure cobra and ordered another when I was done, even if I gave myself a one-drink limit at the beginning of the night! The cocktails are worth it, even if you can't get seated for food.,I've been wanting to go here since I heard Kaiyo opened a Rooftop bar. It's conveniently near the Caltrain station, so I wanted to check this place out while I wait for my ride.The view was so nice for a mid-afternoon clear sky day. There wasn't too many people when I came in so it wasn't as out.For an alcoholic drink, I tried the Sailor Pluto. I really liked the design with the flower & black salt on the side. The foamy drink on top was really delicious and paired well with the salt. It seemed like quite a few other parties were ordering it.For the food, I tried the papa fritas (fries) and the Bluefin Tuna Toast. The fries were crispy & the togarashi seasoning wasn't overwhelming. The aji amarillo sauce was so good with it, you should definitely ask for an extra sauce cup.The toast was so good. I was expecting the rice toast to be a bit bigger, but the flavors were super impactful. It was so crispy & juicy. I'd recommend to try, but I wouldn't get it again.I really enjoyed the food & drinks paired well with the atmospher & view of this place. There's so much to try here, and I'll definitely be coming back. Make sure to reserve ahead of time since it seems that a lot of people make reservations!,I had wanted to come here for so long but it wasn't ideal on a random Wednesday night at 9:30 pm in the cold SF windy night chill.Perfect to impress a date or to have a good time with friends AS LONG AS you're seated next to the heaters.Service was okay. Drinks were a solid 9/10. I though the pisco sour was a solid choice. I'd order it again.Honestly enjoyed the company more than the place but it was a cute vibe. Probably would come back again when it's warmer and with someone I'm trying to impress. It's like an elevated cute bar.,What a cute and interesting fusion! Bf and I stopped by here for dinner for a casual date night. Food and drinks were pretty tasty! I loved the Pork Baos and the Beef Empanadas. I ended up ordering a mezcal margarita that was a special cocktail on the menu, but the name now escapes me. It was delicious. The ambiance here is super cool and chic. Everything is photogenic!! Service was speedy and our waitress was very nice. She gave us lots of great recommendations... always trust your waitress or waiter's suggestions!! :),My girlfriend and I heard a lot of great things about Kaiyo and came here on a Saturday for dinner. The aesthetic is very nice here, but the food and drinks are average. I was expecting more from a place with so much hype. Definitely make reservations if you're trying to come!,Went last month - Incredible view, super stylish ambiance, and good (but not mind blowing) food! The view at night is just WOW and makes the experience worth it. You have to book a reservation in advance, and usually a few weeks beforehand. I booked the week before for a Wednesday evening for a friend who was visiting. It's definitely upscale - you have to be escorted up the elevator to the deck, and there's all sorts of nooks and booths for small groups connected by a long bar area in the middle with seating across the aisle. We split a glass of wine and ordered sushi and it was really yummy!! Tomato Nigiri was fresh and the eggplant in the vegan roll was also a nice touch. Since I've had amazing sushi in the city, these were just a standard level of good. A really fun experience to see the view (s/o to the waitress who took great photos for us) and a good celebration-y place, but you are paying for the vibes more than a *culinary experience* - still worth it!!,Went here on a spur. Very cute place to grab a drink since it over looks the city, hence the name ;)Ended up grabbing dinner as well. Got the Lima Roll & Seafood platter. Platter had great presentation but too sauced up imo. I prefer my oysters with just a hint of lemon.,Kaiyō is one of the few rooftop bars in the city, and an excellent spot for drinks and a view. Located on the 12th floor of the Hyatt, the vibes are tropical, luxurious, and definitely a nice change of pace from SOMA scenery. If you reserve a table you can order Japanese/Peruvian bites (sushi, ceviche, and appetizers) but I'd recommend reserving a table for drinks and skipping the food. Although aesthetic, the food is disappointing. I would recommend the passion fruit ""Space Adventure Cobra"" drink above all else.The reason there aren't many SF rooftops is because of the weather. So although Kaiyo has heat lamps and high walls to break the wind, chances are it'll still be cold. So make sure to bring a jacket/arrive for sunset.,Gorgeous views and beautifully decorated, Kaiyō rooftop is a fantastic place to visit for a good time! It's a culmination of the Japanese experience in Peru, so find lots of Japanese whisky-inspired drinks, crudo and empanadas, sushi, and other great dishes. They're all ok quality, but are a bit pricy for what they are.Get a reservation if you want a table to sit at and food to eat, but feel free to just walk in if you only want to get a quick drink. I got the Space Adventure Cobra, Papas Fritas, and the Kaiyō Roll to share with my friends, and got to watch the sunset! It's extremely cold so you can ask for blankets, or curl up by the heaters if you're in one of the larger tables (if you have more than 2 people in your party).,Neighborhood digs: We finally got to check out Kaiyo Rooftop for the Nikkei cuisine on a random Wednesday night.  It can get windy so make sure you're seated under a heat lamp.   Here is what we ordered:*Chutoro nigiri:  fresh fatty belly with moist sushi rice*Panko crusted prawns:  lightly crusted crunchy and juicy prawns*Squid ink ceviche:  deliciously light ceviche *Beef carpaccio:  the beef was nice against tangy ponzu sauce and crunchy shoestring potato*Chicken karaage:  tasty and juicy fried dark meatPrices reflect thge high quality ingredients and top notch service.,Because of the view, I came here with my significant other on a date night. Even on a Wednesday, it was packed (possibly because there was a private event). Fortunately, we had reservations and were sat at a table. For cocktails, I got the Prince of the Sun and the Sailor Pluto, both of which were delicious (though the Pluto cocktail had stuff on the outside that made the glass a little sticky). The two of us shared the following food:Ceviche Clásico - Great flavor, and not spicy. Nikomi Beef Empanadas - There were a total of 3 of them, and they were adorably small, so they were easy to share. I also thought this tasted great.Oysters - These tasted fresh. We got 6, and half of them had flavor that was more reminiscent of soy sauce while the other half had a flavor that was slightly on the creamier side.Shingo Pear Nigiri - There was soy sauce in the rice, which was a nice complement to the cool, fresh taste of the pear. Kame House roll - This was basically a ceviche-flavored roll. While I like sushi and ceviche generally, I didn't like the combination of them, which meant that the sour flavor was embedded in the sushi rice. Pork Bao Bun - This was pretty good, but it had pickles, which I dislike. Fortunately, the pickles were easy enough to pick out. All in all I had a great experience here and would love to come back for a future special occasion. I also appreciate that there was minimal dining waste (per my Eco Notes below). ECO NOTES (Dine-In)Dine-In Dishware: Reusable plates and bowlsNapkins: Reusable cloth napkinsUtensils: Metal forks, spoons, and knives plus reusable chopsticksWater cups: Short glass cups, no straws.Note: The Prince of the Sun cocktail was served tall and had a black straw, but it didn't look as shiny as typical plastic straws, so it might have been made of something other than plastic.,I had a chance to come here the second time, both different hours, first time I went here it was already dark, so I didn't think the views were nicer. I like/prefer when the sun is just setting, so 6pm reservation was prefect.Street parking was fairly simple, and I think after 6pm it's either free or a lot cheaper depending on where you park. This time I parked on the street just across Oracle Stadium, it was $0.50 per hour on a Friday a night, so I put in 3 hours as a safety net. It was just a 5 minute walk to the venue.The bar is at the rooftop of Hyatt Hotel, if you're confused, just ask the reception about the bar and they'll tell you what to do, so don't worry too much about it.They accept walk ins, I don't know how long the wait is, since both time I went, I had reservations. Okay, on to the food / drinks. I think it was underwhelming on both occasions, imagine me liking French fries more than some of the main dishes? Bluefin tuna toast was good though! The rest, I didn't care too much about. I don't think the rolls are good, I had their kaiyo roll, I didn't like it and I love sushi/nigiris.Honestly, I've tasted maybe a bit of ~7 cocktails in total during both occasions, space cobra was probably the best one, based on my preference. The rest were in my opinion, overpriced(which it's fine because of location) but you can find much better cocktails if you really enjoy cocktails elsewhere. I love cocktails, these did not live up to my taste & expectations! Would I come here again? Absolutely, only on occasions where someone I knew would want to go just to check out this place for the first time. I wouldn't mind hanging out and and watching the city views, but please invite me only when the sun is still up.,We made reservations for 4 a month ago because we know how popular and full this place can get. After getting seated, we waited for about 20 mins for someone to take our order, which was a long time. The service was...meh! Not memorable. They did their job and that's it. Nothing more.Overall, the food was decent but I expected more because the prices weren't cheap. I really enjoyed the Lima Roll and the Kaiyo Roll. Both of them were delicious and I couldn't tell which I liked better.The SHISHITO PEPPERS packed a hot punch! If you eat a lot of them, your mouth will be burning. I guarantee you that lol.The chicken karaage pollo and CEVICHE DE CAMARON were not my favorites. They were both bland. The ceviche didn't even come with chips or anything. The best part of this place is the view. It is like no other rooftop restaurant/bar. It's so beautiful!The Toki Highball was good, if you like whisky!Tbh, not sure if I'd come back. I've had better food at other Japanese or Peruvian places.,The rooftop is located on the top floor of Hyatt hotel, and there will be a security checkout point at the entrance, and the place opens at 2pm daily except for Mondays, and the night view is stunning.,I've come to the Kaiyo Rooftop twice, both times for drinks only, and I really enjoy their cocktails and ambience.Drinks: We had their espresso martini which was phenomenal, pisco sour, and Halloween special. The bartenders are truly skilled and love adding their spin on drinks if you request it, which makes it more special.Ambience: Undoubtedly, Kaiyo is beautiful. I also appreciate the heaters that keeps it comfortable even on cold nights. After 10 pm, you don't need a reservation and can sit anywhere open and available.While I'm not sure I'm keen on trying Kaiyo's overpriced foods, I would highly recommend checking out the views with a cocktail.,What a cool little spot to celebrate my birthday with my party of four! I definitely had reservations as this spot was poppin'. I appreciated being greeted at the hotel door and being escorted to the restaurant elevator after getting my ""VIP stamp."" The ambiance was cute and appropriate for the holidays. We sat outdoors which got a little chilly at moments but not enough that we needed to move. I could swear the log fire on the big screen helped keep us warm. ;-)The food and drinks were great. My favorite being the oysters. We opened and closed our meal with that because it was so fresh and flavorful ... as was the Super Saiyon! I had two rounds of that yumminess. There were other rolls and tapas in between that were also good. ""Japanese culinary influence with Peruvian culture"" is the perfect description.Lastly, clean gender neutral bathrooms are always a plus in my book.,First impressions carry much weight to a business. My first impression at Kaiyo was less than ideal. The host was less than friendly, and smileless. The overall space appeared cramped even though there wasn't a lot of people at the time of our arrival. The atmosphere had a touristy vibe. It is on top of a hotel after all. The bar is standing room only. The bartenders less than friendly and personable. Again, less than ideal.My recommendation, find a friend w a rooftop (plentiful in SF), invite a few more friends, neighbors, have them bring drinks, put on some music, you can make your own Kaiyo.,My coworker and I decided to come here for a ""quick"" bite after doing a news segment with the Giants. It happened to be only a few blocks away, and when in SF, why not cross off a few bucket list places right? We waited in line for maybe 30 mins before they opened for dinner. Little did we know, it was reservations only for dinner and only the bar was open for walk ins. Lady luck was on our side, and the generous host still sat us despite our ignorance haha. He told us that they just needed the table before 6pm and best believe we were out of there at least 30 mins before! We both ordered a cocktail, two rolls of sushi, and some ceviche to share!! Everything tasted delicious. And the view - perfect for date night! Thanks, Kaiyo for the chance to try you out even if we were technically not supposed to be there.,Nice rooftop setting located in Mission Bay in the Hyatt Hotel. Reservations required, unless you plan on sitting at the bar. This is a great place to come for drinks and a view when the weather cooperates. Unfortunately, it was pretty chilly and overcast when we went (thanks, SF), but I can imagine the views of the city would be quite spectacular on a clearer day. It was pretty chilly when we went and they do offer blankets if needed. The drinks and food are a bit pricier, but you are paying for the ambiance. Cocktails range from $15-20 and the food items are - for the most part -  upwards of $15. I enjoyed the Kaiyo roll, but was still pretty hungry afterwards. Great place to come with a group to take in the views and enjoy some Japanese and Latin American-inspired cocktails. Just plan on eating beforehand.,Data & Drinks @KAIYŌ Rooftop SF CA Thur 9/8/22©Came to KAIYŌ for private event. Superb views of San Francisco! Exquisite, refined space. Data & Drinks. Mingling.Everyone I've encountered on my way up or at the lounge are the nicest people, smiling & joking, from the elevator staff to the wait staff, a pleasure to chat with!Located next to the ballpark, the SF Giants stadium, on the 12th floor of the Hyatt Place hotel in SoMa. Roof access & reservations only, booked out months in advance. You get screened downstairs at first, then sent up in special elevator with a guard who has roof access keycard. A smiling hostess will greet you, add a wrist tag to your hand-stamp received downstairs, and direct you to join your party.Our wait staff, Jeff and Brittany, were amazing! Friendly, attentive, giving perfect suggestions on myriad of colorful and delicious cocktails the bartenders were mixing.First, you walk out of the elevator into rich tropical greenery. Centered around Japanese culinary influence within Peruvian culture, KAIYŌ is a Peruvian Japanese Cocktail Bar & Lounge, an immersive Nikkei experience.This is a corporate event, global outreach, a marketing function for execs from current/ potential client companies, people who have the authority to evaluate, recommend or buy their reporting tool.Stellar environment & amazing cocktails, what can I say!Great ambience, laid back atmosphere, superb drinks, amazing food, perfect temperature, terrific views of the City of SF, this spot is fantastic!

I really wanted to love it, because I support new businesses in SF. The ambiance was nice, it was a clear night, so we had a nice view of the city. The food was a 4, it was unique because it's Japanese with Peruvian flare. However, my girlfriends and I were disappointed with the service. The just weren't very friendly, and when we asked a server to take a picture for us, she kinda rolled her eyes. Maybe she didn't think I saw. Maybe it was a bad night for her, so not a huge deal. However, this place is a 3 star for me.,Ah yes, rooftop bar in the city.While the views of this place are stunning, the food AND service is just.... ok.We had no rezzies so my party of 4 waited for 30ish minutes. Once they let you in, you take the elevator to the top and someone in the elevator will guide you. We were seated right near the entrance where chairs were far apart from one another and the table, making it an uncomfortable seating situation.We ordered the seafood platter, 2 rolls, various sashimi and karaage. For drinks, we got space adventure cobra, only yesterday, and koro's big day. TLDR: Everything is INCREDIBLY mid. Nothing blew my mind and nothing makes me miss this place. The views? Gorgeous. But you can go to almost any rooftop within the city and get the same view (for a cheaper price). Additionally, our waiter forgot to put in some of the food we had ordered so we were left waiting longer than we needed to. Done and done with this rooftop spot. Fun if you want views and if you don't care about anything else apart of the whole eating experience.,Here at Kaiyo again last weekend TO CELEBRATE MY BIRTHDAY because I LOVE THIS PLACE SO MUCH!! The vibe is just popping and energetic and my friends and I had a lot of good time here.First of all, I have to say that the staff was very nice and accommodating with my reservation. I knew my party would be 8-10 people but did not get the exact number until last minute. They were very nice and understanding when I called and gave me the spot with a little flexibility in the number of people.Second of all, our server, Steven was a hype king!! Our group had a lot of fun chatting with him. When we asked him to take photos for the group he suggested a lot of great ideas as well! Definitely love his energy and this added so much to our experience at Kaiyo.The drinks were as good as I remember. The food, however, was surprisingly good. I dined at the Kaiyo Cow Hollow before and the food was amazing but did not expect them to exactly carry THE SAME quality at the rooftop. But amazingly they did! We got Kaiyo rolls, Lima Rolls, ceviches, tiraditos, karage and empanadas. We loved them all so much that we just reordered everything!!Thanks Kaiyo for an amazing time and an amazing birthday!! Totally recommend Kaiyo Rooftop as the #1 place to celebrate birthdays and big events with friends in the city.,Inside Hyatt Place, they open at 4pm, so you line up outside the build entrance and the staff will take you up the roof with special access key. View is nice with good city skyline. The food is ok, nicely presented.  The cocktail is over priced, for the Space Adventure Cobra, you get the same cup with ordering hot water. The seating area is green and comfy. Lots of seafood dishes and I can taste some Peruvian taste in the sauce.  Nothing wow on the food but overall ok.,The BEST place in SF for captivating skyline views and the ""GOLDEN HOUR"" is stunning coupled with intoxicating views. Wow! The sushi rolls and sashimi are FIRE. The service is punctual and attentive just like the awesome staff! The VIBE is classic Bay Area with a Who's Who of celebrity guest at any time of day. This beautiful interior design invites guests to mingle and co exist in a beautifully designed space. The Ownership team is a very lovely group of hardworking minority owners from the Bay Area and WOW did they get it right! I feel so INSPIRED! Love the art located in the entry way as you exit the elevator entering into Kaiyō...Super Dope! What an experience!!! The non alcoholic beverages are another example of hitting all the right notes and capturing the details. Take a love one, friend, co worker...whomever you want to WOW...this place will have you all coming back for more than just the selfies and photo ops. Spread and share the word around town that is KAIYŌ ROOFTOP.See you all very soon again!,I've eaten at the other Kaiyo location, so when I heard they opened Kaiyo rooftop in SOMA, I couldn't wait to check it out. Great view, nice ambiance, and an overall fun vibe! Reservations can be somewhat hard to come by, especially in the warmer summer/fall months, and are released 30 days out. Also, they may limit your dining time so be sure to arrive promptly to maximize your experience. The drinks are delicious and in the spirit of eating at a Peruvian / Japanese Sushi bar, I recommend trying the Pisco Sour. It did not disappoint! We were a group of 4 and for the food, we had the Nikkei Oysters, Nikomi Beef Empanadas, Scallop Cebiche, Karaage Pollo, and several rolls of which to me, the LIMA roll was the best.  The food was tasty and well made, but not mind-blowing. My husband also is perhaps more of a sushi purest and to him, all the added sauces took away from the natural flavor of the oysters and the fish. We left the restaurant feeling content, but not stuffed. I think Kaiyo rooftop is a great place to go after work for happy hour, as a first/second date spot, or with out-of-town guests to show them a great view of the city! Just don't forget to bring a warm jacket (even in the summer months) because in SF it can get pretty chilly when the sun goes down.,I finally was able to come here with a reservation, after 1 failed attempt. The ambience is great, views are classic beautiful SF skyline at night, and they really try to channel Peruvian vibes with a giant projection of random Peruvian nature scenes (could have done without this).Food-wise, we ordered the Kaiyo roll, beef empanadas, and yucca fries. The Kaiyo roll was not really memorable and I have definitely had better. However, the empanadas were super fluffy and tasty...they were just tiny!! Yucca fries were okay as well; the sriracha aoili was needed because they were a tad dry. Drinks were cute and tasty. Overall, probably won't be coming back but glad I got to check it out once!,San Francisco, China Basin August 2022Peruvian Nikkei is not Peruvian-Japanese fusion!  The Japanese diaspora in Peru have made their own contribution to modern Peruvian cuisine - it is known globally as Nikkei.  It stands on its own.  If you want a sit-down dining experience of this cuisine, go to the original Kaiyo, on Union St, in Cow Hollow.  Or, wait for the new opening of Kaiyo downstairs on the corner of Townsend and 3rd St.  Kaiyo Rooftop is more about drinking on a rooftop in San Francisco.  It opens at 4:00pm and is usually full by 5:00pm, unless you've already reserved a table.  And you need a table if you want food.  The bar is stand up only with no food served.  While all three elevators will take you downstairs, a doorman bouncer will give you access to the sole elevator going up.   The weekday early crowd is heavily techie.  They're primarily there for social drinking and won't eat unless someone is hosting them.  That means you're probably going to have an attentive server who will get you your food and drinks quickly.   If you can get past sushi rolls, nigiri, sashimi, edamame, fries, and ribs, you'll find the dishes have subtle but distinct Nikkei flavors.  Bright acidic Leche de Tigre may have passionfruit or white miso in a tiradito.  You might find Sal de Maras, Peruvian pink salt from 11,000 feet in the Andes, flavored with yuzu.  Soy may be combined with Japanese Ayu fish sauce. The drinks are equally compelling.  If you don't know anything about cocktails beyond Lychee Martini or vodka fruit Mules, try anything with Pisco.  The Pisco sours are very good.   Pisco is also combined with chicha morada, a sweet Peruvian blue corn beverage, and savory spices are used to good effect.The crowd is looking for a good time.  Think Giants fans who never make it to or leave early from Oracle Park across the street.  Think Millennial and Gen Zs who wear backpacks like they were still in college.  Think pool party nightclub in SoMa/South Beach, even though you're in China Basin.  The food is good, but it's not about the food.  It's about the scene.,It's like one of the best places to see SF. Spectacular views. Drinks were tastey, the food was good, try a roll it's subtle. They have heat lamps if it's cold. A note if they're booked say you will sit at the bar and get on the cancellation list, they seat you in a bit.,Kaiyo is one of SF's newer rooftop bars! I visited back in May, so this review is long overdue lol. Parking: Parking isn't the best situation here but it is SF. You can park a few streets down on the streets, but I believe the hotel it is located in has valet parking? You might need to be a guest though so I'm not sure. Service: We came on a Sunday around 5-6 pm and there was a small line to get inside. They have security that will usually ask you if you're there for the bar and they will let you in by small groups. I HIGHLY recommend making reservations if you want to order food and if you want a table because those do fill up quickly. If you are just ordering drinks, no worries just let the host know you are there for the bar. My friends and I ordered a few drinks and the bartender that served us was really quick and the drinks tasted really well. Drinks: My friend and I ordered 2 mojitos, and they were amazing. It was a nice blend of sweetness and alcohol and it was strong enough to get me a bit tipsy. I ended up ordering another one because I loved it so much. They also have a nice variety of other specialty drinks, as well as any alcohol that you would typically order from a bar. Environment: The rooftop was very pretty and nicely decorated! The outside was gorgeous, and the view was amazing. I would definitely come here again. Overall, nice place to chill for drinks and to enjoy SF's skyline. I would be open to trying their food as well! Looks delicious!,If you'd like to dine here, then make a reservation. If you do not care for the food, you can just walk in and stand at the bar. I do not like drinking but I could probably have their Space Adventure Cobra over and over, it's THAT good. View is nice!,Firstly, if you want to order food, make sure to make a reservation and check when last call for the kitchen is. The rooftop has a nice view of the city and as warned, can get pretty chilly even though they have heat lamps.The drinks I tried were decent, not the best Pisco Sour I've had in SF, but passable. I enjoyed their Space Adventure Cobra which is on the sweeter side, but was balanced with the tartness from the passion fruit. Tried several of their cebiches: classico, hamachi, salmon, and scallop. All of them were tasty, my favorites were the salmon and scallop.Tried their ribs (good but not amazing), and their tuna toast (very good, don't miss this one) and would have wanted to order more food, but they apparently had last call for the kitchen/food but our server didn't tell us beforehand so we couldn't order more :(When the check came they had mistakenly charged us for a mocktail instead of a chicha morada even though our server was the one who suggested the chicha morada for our friend who doesn't drink. We didn't bother asking them to correct it because we were trying to get out of there quickly so we make it to order at the Taco Bell across the street since we were still hungry.Don't think I'd go back for food, but might go for drinks again. Next time I'm in the area and want to order food past 9pm I'd definitely go to Woodbury just up 3rd St. instead,Really nice ambiance, good food and drinks, good music, and overall a good vibe! Highly recommend making a reservation, but if you don't, they do have a bar/open seating area. And having the view of the city is just lovely around sunset. It is",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
outdoors so dress accordingly. But they do have heaters!Oh also, the service is great!! Loved: Koro's Big Day, Lima roll, and the fries (perfectly crisp!),Great nighttime rooftop bar spot for those looking for a couple cocktails and small plates to share w/friends on a chill night out (or also a great date spot)! Would highly recommend making a reservation, although you might have to do it a while out (ours was made a couple weeks in advance); the line to get in on even a Tuesday night seemed very long.In terms of the bar itself, the food, drinks, and the view of the city make for a good time. We split the Yuca fries and the Karaage; they were both delicious!! (And reasonably priced as well if you split it. )For drinks, would highly recommend the Prince of the Sun. A little sweet with a citrusy, slightly bitter after taste.Only downside is that 1) it gets pretty cold if the you are not right next to a heater and 2) the area we were sitting in had these huge, bright television screens that made it a little less ambient, but otherwise, had an amazing time!! Would come back again :),Unfortunately the place was half closed off for a private event.... On a Friday...but the bar was open so we took advantage of a good drink!  The espresso martini was made to perfection I truly enjoyed it a lot.  Many places have been adding baileys... honestly more simple the better.... Sam was a great bartender.The rooftop was warm! I expected to freeze my butt off but it was super pleasant!  Hope to make it back another time to eat!,Beautiful views. Service was ok Food was ok. Not impressed, but the star dish was the oyster. I asked for a double bourbon but they informed me  that they did not allow this. What a shame because my single was definitely half of a single. Reservations are a must for dining. Would I recommend? Ehh... come for the hype and views at least once. Thanks!,Went right when they opened at 4 on a Tuesday, and made a reservation online the day before. The security at the street entrance was very friendly and service was fast, being that it wasn't crowded right when it opened.The rooftop was a nice view," ambiance was enjoyable. Ceviche tasted very fresh! Sushi was delicious as well but not """"to die for"""". Obviously prices are high due to the rooftop and San Francisco", but would go again if I'm willing to splurge for a nice meal out. They do not have desserts.,Very cute rooftop venue on the top floor of Hyatt. It's very packed around dinner time. Reservations recommended. Bar area and fire place area are well decorated. Food and drinks are good but too pricey. The night view is ok but the patio is small, so need to wait to take photos.,I dined at the Kaiyo location in Cow Hollow before and didn't have a strong impression of it at the time now in my memory of it. However, I was willing to give Kaiyo Rooftop a chance because of the view. And what a view! It's a great spot to watch the sunset immersed with the city skyline. However, my memory served me wrong and the food is really... not that great. We ordered the beef empanadas, fries, and one of each of the sushi rolls to share. It's a great mix of expensive food and small portions, a great recipe to be hungry right after dinner. Better yet, the fish was bland, and one of the dishes had a sauce that tasted straight up like ranch. I ordered the Prince of the Sun cocktail which was a strong drink, I don't think they added enough of the lime and yuzu soda to dilute the flavor if the alcohol. The restaurant is located at the top of the Hyatt, and when entering the hotel the bouncer checks IDs and directs people on where to go. We didn't have reservations (those go so fast on resy!) but were able to put our names down with the hostess to call us if any tables were available. If you weren't interested in food, you were free to go to the rooftop bar though there would not be an seats for you. Thankfully we were able to get a table, which was more a couch that we crammed into next to a low table. It was really hard to get a hold of our waitress with so many people from the bar pooling around tables since there was so many people (mind you this was on a Tuesday night).,All hype and unimpressive. I feel like there's a certain snobby attitude about this place that is super unnecessary. Before you even get to the front door of the hotel lobby, there's a security guard eyeing you from down the street getting ready to make sure you have a reservation before anything else. You get a stamp and head through the lobby to an elevator where the elevator attendant gets notified via radio that you are heading over and checks your stamp to let you up... (I get they can't just let anyone but sheesh, I felt like I was going to meet the governor or something). Like other people said," it gets *COLD*. Their heat lamps are pretty much useless. The """"best"""" seats are in the coldest area. If you want something in the semi enclosed area", you're stuck right by the bar where everyone is crowding around. Staff are attentive but it's almost to hurry to get you out to seat the next people. I wasn't told there was a time limit and when we tried to order dinner, we were told our time was up and that we had to leave. Not sure how great the fusion sushi is, I guess we'll never know!Was not impressed by the view and the place is a lot smaller than videos and social media makes it out to seem. With SF weather, you'll need to dress very warm. This place gives me anxiety.,If you're looking for a great view, ambiance, and service, this is the place to go!My husband and I were let in by the security guard at the Hyatt to go up to the rooftop. We were seated right away at the time of our reservation. Even though we were high up, we were never cold because there were heat lamps everywhere.Ceviche Nikkei 4/5 - This was unique because the ceviche had miso and other unexpected ingredients, making it a true Asian fusion dish. However, it was pretty salty.Beef Empanadas 2.5/5 - I would not get these again because they had too much bread and not enough meat.Kaiyo Roll 3/5 - This was an average roll.Otoro Nigiri 4.5/5 - Buttery and delicious!,TLDR: I love a good view in the city. Make a resy so you don't have to wait in line when you arrive. Otherwise, you'll likely stand at the crowded bar. I'd come back here to grab drinks and snack on the empanadas. Food: 3.5/5 we ordered pretty much a little bit of everything. I thought everything was decent but I don't think anything really blew my mind aside from the beef empanadas and the oysters. The oysters we ordered 2 dozen. We also ordered drinks and tequila shots for our party of 6. Lima rollKaiyo roll Kame house rollYuca fries Papas fritasBeef empanadas Beef tatakiSalmon ceviche Shishito peppers Choros on the half shell or oysters with ponzu Otoro nigiri Ambiance: 5/5 a bit windy but so worth it and our waiter offered us a blanket as we enjoyed dinner and drinks. Service: 5/5 at one point we did find a piece of hair in the salmon ceviche. We told our waiter and he asked if we wanted another dish or wanted to cancel it. That was sweet of him.,San Francisco doesn't have a great rooftop bar scene nor is the skyline spectacular. But KAIYO is great. Great for a night out with friends or a date. Don't worry, although it is outdoors it's very warm in winter. They have heaters everywhere. Very cozy, warm, festive, busy, and loud. Just the right place to be.Didn't try the food. The drinks were good. Decent price. Nothing too crazy for SF. They close at midnight and the last call is 11:30 pm. if you want to stay longer than 30 min you should come here around 10 pm.,I've been to Kaiyo a few times for a events and it is a beautiful space! People come for the views, but I also really enjoyed the service and the food--it's definitely Asian fusion, so lots of fish like ceviche and tuna! The drinks are also very good.,We made a reservation for Kaiyo a little less than a month in advance, and we had a good dinner there! Definitely was a bit rowdier because there was a Giants game that day, and some of the crowd were a little too close for comfort for our reserved seating. Otherwise, the view was gorgeous and the food was decent. I really enjoyed the Space Adventure Cobra, which our waiter recommended when I asked for a fruitier drink. The shrimp tempura roll was so crispy, and the seared fish on top of the Lima roll was very fresh and rich. Papas fritas were also super yummy, a nice touch of spice from the seasoning and a creamy dipping sauce, would order again. The biggest reason why I'm rating 4 stars instead of 5 is because the bathroom was absolutely Atrocious. I get that it's a bar and plenty of people are intoxicated and messy but it was pretty bad. Also, we ubered to the restaurant because the Giants game made parking super tough and they don't have a private lot dedicated to the restaurant I believe. We came on a warmer afternoon around 5:30 for our reservation, so it didn't get too cold at all. Overall, a good first rooftop bar experience, but I'd like to try out a few others too.,Was able to snag reservations on a Sunday night. This is located on the rooftop through Hyatt Place and there was someone at the lobby who asked if we had reservations before allowing us to go up to the rooftop. Was eager to check this place out since I've heard great things about it but the whole experience was a bit miserable because of the cold weather. The food overall was presented well but some dishes were either too salty or drenched in sauce. However, we did enjoy the Veggie Gyoza and Crispy Yucca because they came piping hot which helped because it was windy and freezing outside. Probably bad timing to come here in the evening. Wore three layers of clothing but it was not enough! Although there was a heater next to our table, we were literally shivering the entire time. Others around us were offered throw blankets and asked for hot drinks (we asked too). Unfortunately, they do not have anything to drink that's hot. Service was standard. Our server checked in with us once after we received some of our order. Other staff helped clear the dishes alway as we finished them.,Ever since KAIYO rooftop opened up, I had wanted to check it out. Located on top of the Hyatt Place by Giants stadium, the restaurant/bar is Japanese Peruvian fusion and has sweeping views of SF and the Bay. We went on a Friday night, party of three, around 11pm, no reservations. You enter the Hyatt Place hotel and let them know you're going to KAIYO and a security member will buzz you into the elevator to let you up. Once you arrive on the roof, the vibe is super cool. Beautiful art on the wall with a tropical modern atmosphere once you step into the actually outdoor space. It's super aesthetic! We were able to grab a seat that had just cleared up and were promptly greeted by a waitress. Food was unavailable as the kitchen had closed by the time we arrived.- Space Adventure Cobra- Dark Side of the CloudAt $16 a drink, we weren't too impressed with our drinks. While they each had a very unique blend of ingredients, we didn't love them, but maybe that's on us for what we ordered. The presentation was beautiful though, combined with the ambiance of the atmosphere. I would consider coming back for the food as it also looks stunning.,Kaiyo Rooftop has been on my summer must list after seeing all the posts and videos on Instagram. With it's location in a picturesque area, a lovely rooftop restaurant and bar, and the fact that it's summer--it's truly the place to be! I made reservations online over a month in advance as they fill up fast due to their popularity! My friend and I arrived at the Hyatt Place at our 5:00 p.m. reservation time. We were asked for our names then entered the hotel and were brought up the elevator to the rooftop. Once we arrived at the rooftop, I was awestruck! We really lucked out as it was a beautifully clear and warm sunny day. The rooftop was bright, loud, and lively--but the real charm was the view. We had a stunning view of downtown San Francisco, Twin Peaks, and Oracle Park from all angles. The restaurant was spacious, relaxing, and easy to navigate (although it started to fill up overtime). There were plenty of comfortable seats (with some coverage) from high-top tables to lounge couches. Even the lush plants and trendy scenery added a fun tropical pop. The service was stellar by our waiter! He wished me a belated happy birthday with a complimentary beverage--which was unexpected! He was charismatic, down to earth, and provided his personal recommendations to us. One of those being the Cebiche Clasico, which we ordered and shared. Since this is a fusion Peruvian and Japanese restaurant, the ingredients in the ceviche were strikingly different. The fish was mild but it had that typical citrusy taste to it with a little heat. It was presented beautifully but all that was missing was some chips to go along with it! We took our time eating and drinking and didn't feel rushed. My only regrets are that I didn't make our reservations closer to when the sun set as this would've been a great spot to catch it. Nonetheless, I'm so happy to have checked out another rooftop bar in San Francisco--which might be my new favorite! Come for the spectacular views, lively crowd, and ambiance--stay for the friendly service and  food. I'm already looking forward to coming back with friends and trying their other dishes!,A perfect place to come grab after-work drinks and some small bites. Definitely not yet a celebration place or full meal place. You'll still be surrounded by plenty of tech bros (not yet laid off?) on weeknights, but even so, their cocktails are made with care and there are a few dishes to highlight. Don't sleep on the oysters as their tiger milk is pretty creamy and delectable. I would also recommend getting the Kaiyo roll. Nigiri and sashimi aren't exactly as good as you'd get at a specialists so save your money there. Can't beat the view and ambiance though.,The only thing worth to experience here would be the view. The service doesn't match the place. First, we called if there would be any wait time, we arrived there 15 mins after we called. The hosts told us to wait around, and we will be texted, after 10 mins we got a text that our table was ready and right away we got back to the host (under a minute) then they told us that we missed it cause they gave the table to a different guest. I was so confused about how they could give the table under 1 minute. We tried to understand and asked how much longer we should wait, and the response to us was," """"we're not sure cause we are fully booked"""" How? when there were so many table open", and they gave away the table we waited for 10mins. We waited for another 10 mins until they apologized that they confused our table and gave it away, the hosts told us we can only be there at the table for an hour because they are making our situation an exception. The treatment/service we didn't expect for being part of Hyatt.,Located on the 12th floor of the Hyatt Place hotel. There is a bouncer outside of the hotel that will direct you where to go. It wasn't very crowded on a Sunday evening. Atmosphere is top notch and the views are amazing. You have a great view of the city no matter where you are sitting. This is a true rooftop bar with unobstructed views. Very spacious and lots of room to take photos. However, the service is bad and the drinks were not very good. The servers didn't seem very knowledgeable about the drinks and weren't helpful in guiding us on what to order. The drinks came out very slowly and were inconsistent - some were too watered down, some were too strong, some were too sweet. It's worth checking out once for the views only.,8.14.2022 | 7pmLocation: Kaiyo Rooftop is located on the roof of the Hyatt Place San Francisco / Downtown. There does not seem to be easy parking in the area as it is close to the ballpark. We made a reservation on Resy one month out. We arrived at the hotel and waited in line for about 10 minutes until a server brought us and other groups up via elevator. The rooftop itself is beautifully decorated, with vibrant colors and lush green backdrops. It is quite small and crowded, however. The high top seating and bar area had floor-to-ceiling windows, while the sit-down lounge area had a balcony with fresh air. Service: Our server was Michelle. She was not too attentive with us during our meal, possibly due to the high volume of guests. We had to wait a while to get the bill.Food:* Bluefin Tuna Toast ($18): this was very delicious but the portion was quite small, as there was only 2 pieces of tuna crispy rice at such an inflated price. The tuna was good and fatty but overpriced.* Scallop Ceviche ($22): the squid ink and black color threw us off a bit, and made it very difficult to see what we were eating. The flavor was great but there was very little pieces of scallop compared to the garnishes. Overall pretty disappointing.* Lima Roll ($18): honestly this was my favorite part of the meal. The shrimp tempura and seared yellowtail had great contrasting textures. The only complaint is that the roll was drenched in sauce.The cocktails are around $16 each, but nothing caught our eye.Overall, this looks to be a good place for casual drinks and a good view of the city, but expect large crowds and to spend money on overpriced food that will leave you hungry. I much prefer the Kaiyo in Cow Hollow.,We booked our reservation a month in advance. If you want to eat here at a table definitely make a reservation. I've been here twice for food and found that there were some inconsistencies between the quality of the crispiness of therice but it was still delicious !,Must get resy here, not easy to get but worth it. Having gone one time before with a huge line having to wait outside. The views incredible. The drinks amazing. The space drink comes in the adorable doll glass. Tried the ahi tuna on toast. Had the most amazing server. She was so freakin awesome. It was like we were all friends. She def deserved a huge tip. Would def come again!!,It can be a challenge to get a table reservation here, but I also recommend checking the booking site 1-2 days before your prospective visit to scoop up open reservations from last minute cancellations.   It also appeared that they were accepting walk in's for people to stand at the bar and order drinks.The vibes, service, cocktails, and food are all amazing here.  The rooftop has excellent views of the city.  I ordered 2 cocktails-  Akko's Secret and Dark Side of the Cloud. Great options if you like whiskey drinks.  Several other cocktails sounded promising as well.  To eat, I ordered the Salmon Ceviche and the Lima Roll.  The Salmon Ceviche was bursting with flavor and really fresh tasting.  The Lima Roll also had a great flavor profile. Such a positive experience at Kaiyo,A very cute date location! Unfortunately we went on a day where it was just super windy but I still very much enjoyed the experience.Good:Very cool location - a 3 min walk from the caltrain and easy to get to! I loved how we went up to the top floor of the hotel to get here.Solid unique dishes - my fave was the empanadas- lots of food and good texture each bite. Fun drinks too - all anime inspired and I liked the space adventure cowboy. The beef tataki was good too! Bad:Didn't like the squid ink ceviche very much - kind of a gooey texture.Overall a beautiful place to watch the sunset and get a date! Make a rez a month in advance.,Beautiful view and bar. Bartenders are very talented. I like to have bartenders to create their own cocktails based on my requests. I asked for a mezcal drink, but something that is not sweet and will not overpower the mezcal but enhance it. He did a very good job of creating the right balance.,Nearly impossible to experience this amazing rooftop bar without reservations weeks on advance.  The Assistant GM victor was very helpful via email responding to me and making changes to my rsvp when I reached out to him The only reason I don't give them five stars is cause the elevator coordinator was so rude to us cause he couldn't find our reservations. He wasn't listening to us  and truly but a huge damper on our evening. But the food upstairs and the hostess, elevator liaison, and bartenders  and waiter were super cool and helpful.  Staff was a little overwhelmed. Really genuine 100 on the food and drinks. And real Japanese Peruvian fusion here.   The mussels with Tigre sauce were w amazing. The bad buns were perfect and light.  The sushi was fresh with a hint of lime, Lima style and the drinks were divine.  Totally wanting to Come Back if the doorman isn't there any more. I wanna make my 4* into a 5*,Spent Father's Day lunch at Kaiyo rooftop...we collectively rate it like 3 stars? Lol the people who took us up to the restaurant were pretty rude, aggressively telling all the groups there to hurry up. & it was wildly hot up there in the sun but there were no umbrellas so my shoulders burned off and I got like 50 shades darker. I could see it being a vibe in the evening / at sunset but I heard it gets really windy then too so I dunno lolI really liked my drink! The Space Adventure Cobra: gin, passionfruit, matcha coconut cream, lemon, + bitters but I can't say it was worth $18. I tried the shishitos, beef tataki, & the scallop ceviche which had squid ink & sweet potato purée. Those were all pretty good! But everyone else's food took over an hour to come out so I had to eat my whole meal before anyone got their food cuz my stuff was raw and I didn't want it to get fried in the sun. It definitely got warm really fast since we were in direct sunlight. My friends were disappointed in the sushi rolls & even though the tuna tartare looked good," one friend said they were ok """"$9 per piece? No."""" anyways overall really disappointed cuz I was excited about this res but worth a try for the views I guess??",I've visited this rooftop bar a few times when it just opened and really liked the vibe! We got there at 4:30pm on a Saturday and had to line up downstairs for 10 mins. We couldn't get a walk in table so parked ourselves at the bar. The views are stunning - you have the modern tall skyline on one side, and the pretty SF hills on the other. Sunset was spectacular from here. We got Pisco Sours - strong lemon flavored cocktail and Koro's Big Day - a spicy Mezcal drink, both very good. The Nikomi beef empanadas were delicious, we got 2 portions! Check the weather, especially wind speed before you get up there as it can get quite chilly! Fortunately they have some heaters spread out. Pro tip - ask the server for blankets, they have some on request to keep you warm :),Kaiyo rooftop is located at the top of Hyatt Place Hotel - someone will be in the lobby asking if you're here for Kaiyo and help bring you up the elevator (not the same one for hotel guests). They are super busy and even if you come with a reservation, there is a potential wait of 15 minutes (they do not take walk-ins unless you're going to the bar and don't want to be seated). The views from this place were amazing! Just remember that it's still quite chilly as it's on a rooftop in SF :) For drinks, we ordered the Space Adventure Cobra cocktail and a pisco sour. The flavors for both were great, however the pisco sour was served in a chipped glass. We ordered several plates to share:Karage PolloBeet-cured salmon tiraditoScallop tiraditoKaiyo rollLima roll After reading so many positive reviews, I was surprisingly disappointed by the lima roll. It didn't taste bad per say," but it didn't """"wow"""" me either. It was very average despite its pretty presentation. The Kaiyo roll on the other hand was great! And the main star of the show was definitely the tiraditos. They look great and taste even better! Even my friend who doesn't really like seafood enjoyed them!",If you want amazing views, delicious fusion cocktails, and a little bit of an upscale bougie vibe, this is the place for you. Kaiyo's food is delicious but gets kind of overshadowed by the lively, instagrammable atmosphere and the fact that it's impossible to get reservations, so their original location definitely lends itself more to a dining experience. The rooftop is perfect for sipping cocktails and taking pictures of people sipping cocktails.,Great view from the rooftop. Unfortunately they are so packed that there is basically a 0 chance that you can get in if you dont already have a reservation. Though they do take walk ins for drinks and have a lot of standing room.,One of the dopest bars/lounges I've been to recently.My friends surprised and took me here recently and I can't wait to come back. If I lived in the city this would definitely be part of the bar rotation. Not only does the decor about this place look amazing but the food and drinks are just as awesome. Oddly enough I don't really care for Veggie Gyoza. Meat or bust. But mannnn that Veggie Gyoza was poppin. As for drinks I *highly* recommend The Wind Rises. It's like a Tiki take on a Pisco Sour. Honestly one of the best Sours I've ever had in my life. To top it all off theres a big TV screen at the end where you can watch some sports. I can totally see some peeps coming here to watch Giants or Warriors game. And the view? Kaiyo please...,And the Birthday celebrations continue! Finally made it to the hottest new restaurant in SF.I've been to their other location located in the Marrina off Union which was excellent and the rooftop was just as good. Different menu compared the restaurant but lots of choices. Peruvian and Japanese cuisine you can't go wrong with that. RSVP highly suggested as the Giants game ended and there were many people trying to get in. Atmosphere? Cracking with RNB tip bumping along with some reggae made the mood. Anyhoot, I won't go in details about the food since I rated it at 5 stars so that should tell you enough.,If you're looking for a rooftop spot t9 lounge and have a few drinks, this is a hip little spot to hang. Decent view of downtown and the Bay Bridge and walking distance from Oracle Park. Cocktails are great and food is pretty good too.,I will say this is probably closer to a 3.5 stars but I'll round up for the experience with a larger group because I normally wouldn't wait 2.5 hours for a table On my most recent visit to the city I had multiple friends tell me about Kaiyo the new rooftop bar near Oracle Park/Chase. They mentioned it was hard to make reservations to dine in and I thought I would be fine 3 weeks out but it wasn't enough time :( Since it was a nice enough day we decided to take our chances with a group of 7 and just head over early on a Thursday. We got to the hotel around 4:30PM on a weekday and were allowed to the rooftop with little to no wait to go up the elevator. We thought it would be fine to get a table since we were allowed up but there was a private event going on already. We ended up putting our name down at the front and it ended up 2.5 hours before we were seated. We were thinking of leaving after 1 drink but ended up staying for two rounds so the time just passed by. I was a little apprehensive of staying since the first bartender we ordered from was super slow and she couldn't remember the drinks we ordered and asked us again multiple times. It took her over 15 mins to get our drinks prepared. We got her again the second round and pretty much ordered the same drinks but they tasted different from the first round :\ The view itself on a clear and not super windy day was great! You don't see too many rooftops in SF so it's worth checking out the space. ____________________________After 2.5 hours we ended up getting a table to finish up the warrior game so we got a mix of their entrees that we shared family style. + KARAAGE POLLO+ PORK BAO BUNS+ NIKOMI BEEF EMPANADA+ CRISPY YUCCA+ CEBICHE CLÁSICO+ KAIYO ROLLAll in all, I think they have good portion sizes to share and the items have unique flavors. The items were tasty and we left nothing on the plates. The empanada and karaage were my favorites. They did forget our ribs and fries though so we ended up cancelling and not trying them this time :\ ____________________________Overall, I do think they are still a bit hyped being new. It's a nice view and decor is great with the large screen that plays local sports. They do still have some kinks to work out with service and attentiveness to folks during dinner service.,Finally got a reservation for dinner here after attempting to for a while! Parking around here isn't the funnest since it's right by Oracle park. The ambiance & views here are really great. It's very windy and cold, but they have plenty of heat lamps by the bar area.For drinks, we ordered the Super Saiyan, Only Yesterday, and the Space Adventure Cobra. The Space Adventure Cobra was SO good! The drinks are not too strong here though.For food, we ordered the white fish ceviche & kaiyo roll. For the price, we weren't wowed by either; the portions are v small and the taste is good but not anything amazing.Overall glad we finally got to visit and I'd be down to walk in again for the drinks. I'll probs be skipping out on the food next time !,If you want to see what the tech culture is like in San Francisco, just come here after work hours haha!Met up with a friend around 6pm on a Thursday summer night and it was packed. The rooftop bar is located inside the Hyatt hotel and the doorman there will help take you up there directly. It was packed! Maybe it was too loud but 2/3 of our orders were incorrect and we didn't noticed it until the receipt came. We wanted the thick cut yucca fries but got the Papas Fritas (thin cut) instead. We thought hmmm maybe this was thick for them as we didn't see there was another type of the fries on the menu. Anyway even though it wasn't the fries we wanted, nothing too special about the thin cut fries that I would want it again.We wanted the Scallop Tiradito but got the Scallop Cebiche instead. We weren't too mad about it because it was the best tasting dish of the night. Last dish we got was the Bluefin Tuna Toast. This was flavorless unfortunately. The crispy rice was bland and the tuna as well.As for drinks I got the Wind Rises and my friend got the Prince of the Sun. My drink was crisp and refreshing but half of it was foam! I've been the the Marina location a couple of times and knew that Kaiyo is mainly known for its drinks named after Anime. Overall if you want to come here for the vibes, I recommend coming here solely for the drinks.,This is round three for me coming here! We love the menu here, and the drinks are also delicious! I tried the espresso martini this time, and it was absolutely delicious. The food was 10 out of 10 all around, but once again, this restaurant has not figured out how to make this a pleasant experience with the weather. If you're seated underneath the cover, you have heaters, beaming, directly down at you keeping you warm, so you can even take your jacket off. But anywhere besides, that area is a pretty unpleasant experience. It's really windy, the heaters do absolutely nothing to keep you warm, honestly, they have the wrong types of heaters for this environment, and it's absolutely freezing to the point where the waiters are even wearing sweaters and beanies. They could definitely improve on this.,Another one off my Yelp bookmarks Located inside the Hyatt Hotel on the 12th floorWalked up to the main entrance of the hotel and there was a section set a side for customers to stand in line specifically to enter KAIYO rooftop  BUT thankfully there was NO LINE We walked inside the hotel ....  We were asked if we were going to the rooftop," we said yes.....  and we were carded and then lead to the 3rd elevator.....  from there hotel staff escorts you to the rooftop.....   I immediately noticed beautiful hallway painted ... Walked in and the hostess greeted us..... asked if we had reservations we said NO  she stated to us that Dining was RESERVATIONS ONLY and that if by chance there was a cancellation we could take that spot ...   So we went ahead and signed up for the """"cancellation list"""" We had some drinks at the bar ......  bartender was friendly and attentive .... Drinks were good About 30 min in we were advised that there was seating for us YAAYYY     We ordered Karaage chicken and French fries Both items were good !!! Waitress/servers were friendly Beautiful view of the cityHeating lamps available Big screen with the game onLatin music playing Food is reasonably pricedReservations are fully booked for one month out It's SF soo of course parking is never easy We came We saw We conquered On to the next",The drinks are pretty tasty, but nothing too good! And the view is literally so nice (you can see everything). The line for this place gets pretty long and even though you're a guest at the hotel (which I was), you still can't just go straight to the rooftop which was what I thought was weird. We literally had to leave our room and wait outside just to come back in. I'm giving 3 stars because the service was kinda weird. Although I only ordered drinks, it seemed like the bartenders didn't want to be there, work, and even make our drinks. I came when it was slowing down and didn't get acknowledged for awhile (even though there were bartenders not doing anything). Would I come back? Yes, but probably more for the view and vibes.,This place is amazing!!!! Victor the manager went above and beyond! Great great customer service!! Let's talk about The location.... Beautiful rooftop with the San Francisco amazing view. The restaurant/ bar is on top of the Hyatt hotel. Close to the giants stadium. The food was delicious! We ordered the crispy shrimp, the kaiyo roll, beef taktaki, and the Lima rollOver all yum! Enjoy every bite Over all 5 stars can't wait to go back!,This review is purely for drinks only. We didn't know you had to make a reservation to get food, so just grabbed a couple drinks and left. The wait is pretty ridiculous, but it is very pretty when you get to the rooftop. COLD (when I went), but pretty. We got seats at the bar and the bartender immediately tended to us and was super friendly! Drinks were good and definitely aesthetically pleasing. Loved the very extra engraved ice! Peep my pictures to see what I mean! I really want to come back and try their food, but it's always booked. Will review again once I get a reservation!,An excellent rooftop bar in San Francisco with incredible city views and a Japanese and Peruvian cocktail menu and bites. You'll need a reservation to eat in, but they will accept walk-ins as long as you're willing to wait in line to go up to the bar.During my visit I had a cocktail and a beer. The drink was DARK SIDE OF CLOUD STRIFE: toki japanese whisky, cherry heering, amontillado, montenegro, absinthe, amargo chuncho. It mixed well, I order absinthe drinks as a nod to my friends from college and this one did not disappoint.I'd like to try the Pisco in a future visit. Pisco is one of those things that will either be really good or really bad and I was pressed on time.I also enjoyed an Asahi Super Dry, which is always appreciated. The service was good, but the staff was stressed from the Giants game day crowds that flooded the bar earlier, which is understandable. They still were attentive and promptly made my drinks upon order and also were not difficult about closing my tab either. 10/10 would go back and recommend to anyone in the city. You have to watch the sunset here. Bring a jacket for cold days.,The view is absolutely amazing. The whole vibe with the colorful lights and big screen make it. You can see the entire SF skyline at the back of the restaurant. I got sushi and it was pretty good! Nothing crazy but delicious.,I had a good time celebrating my best friend's birthday here this past weekend. I made a reservation a few weeks prior and I'm glad I did! It's a very popular rooftop bar and it seemed like almost everyone had a reservation! I did notice one pair that tried to do a walk in with no reservation and they were turned away. We all ordered cocktails all around the table. I ordered the Space Adventure Cobra and everyone likes my drink better than their own! It's also rated number 1 as the most popular drink on the menu :) Definitely a must try when you're here. AND it also comes in a cute cup!We ordered edamame, crispy yucca, and choros on the half shell (mussels) to share at the table. I enjoyed the mussels the most - it had a nice kick to it! Very flavorful! The yucca fries were also really good and we all gobbled that up quickly.I shared two rolls with my fiancé - the Kaiyo roll and the Lima roll. Both rolls were good but I liked the Kaiyo roll the most - more raw fish and more flavorful than the Lima roll. Food came out pretty quickly until it didn't. My best friend and fiancé both wanted to order one more otoro nigiri each to end the meal. We waited over 30 mins and  decided to cancel the order. No nigiri is worth a 30 min wait! Make sure to check your receipt if you cancel any orders. The server confirmed that they canceled the order with the kitchen but we were still charged on the receipt so I pointed it out and they readjusted it!Service was spotty so I couldn't rate this place 5 stars. I had better service at other restaurants. Maybe it was just our waiter - he had a idgaf attitude when we were trying to figure out our order. Other than that, it's a very nice spot for a night out with friends - but don't forget your jacket! It can get windy!,After several times trying to make a reservation, I could finally go. It was full of people. Lovely decor full of planta. There's a huge QR code at the entry for the menu and also in the coasters. Service was good. If you speak spanish, you can also order in that language. The music wasn't too loud. Tip: Bring a jacket. It was windy and cold. I came prepared with a sweater, jacket, scarf and beanie. It seems too much but you will thank me later.Drinks: -Pisco sour. This is one of my favorite drinks so I was happy how good it was.-Space adventure cobra. It was so good! It has matcha coconut cream so I was worried it could be heavy but it was very light and tropical. Loved it. You need to try this!Food:I'm not used to spicy food so it might be spicy for me but not for you. The dishes are more on the smaller size.-Beef Empanadas. Smaller than I expected. A little bit spicy. The dough was a little heavy maybe made with butter. -Yuca fries. Nothing special. The Huancaina sauce was good. -Karaage chicken. I liked this dish. Crispy and juicy. Comes with a sauce. -Nikkei oysters. 3 are with ponzu and 3 with leche de tigre. I liked those with the latter. More citric and leas spicy than those with ponzu.-Sake sashimi. A little spicy for me but the flavors were good. Fresh fish.-Lima roll. I tried just a piece because it has cilantro and I can't stand it. Didn't feel it at all. I enjoy it. -Kame house roll. My favorite. Not spicy, good flavors. I was kind of sad they didn't have desserts.The Restroom was clean. Loved the wallpaper. It has a speaker so you can enjoy the music haha.I recommend this place. Good drinks, amazing view. Good for have quick bites, not for a proper dinner unless you're not that hungry.,I had been waiting to try this place, and expectations were pleasantly exceeded! Highly recommended to get a reservation if you can, because the bar area gets crowded with not much seating space if at all. Beautiful rooftop reviews of the city and a great atmosphere! The Japanese and Peruvian fusion were tasty bites to have with our drinks. The yucca fries here are some of the best I've had! Would definitely come back again, with reservations of course :),Place was amazing! Drinks, environment, music, bartenders and all. We went here hoping to eat but didn't get the chance due to company party's taking place but that's ok. We got drinks here and the bartenders were amazing. Made any substitutions that we asked and were happy about doing so. They also noticed we weren't from town and recommended at ton of amazing places for us to visit while in town. As well as they have an amazing video of the city. They also paid attention to more detail and noticed we were in town for a birthday and gave us a shot. Would 100% go back for drinks and next time hopefully food. If you are in San Francisco definitely visit this place!,Spontaneously came here with my date for drinks and was trying to swoop a table. Unfortunately, they are always booked for dinner so don't show up without a reservation if you're looking for food. Instead, we enjoyed the view + vibes + drinks. We got the Koro Big Day (spicy) and the Pink Flamingos. I don't drink much so Pink Flamingos was perfect for me since it was sweet. My boyfriend really liked his drink so I would recommend this place for cocktails before heading out somewhere!!,Fiancé and I celebrated our engagement here with some drinks. Definitely make a reservation if you want to skip the line. The view here is amazing. Place is quite small so I think a small group is better and more intimate. Cocktails - cups are tiny. My whiskey sour was mostly egg white, like half of the cup was foam? When I sent it back to the bar, bartender didn't seem happy. They did remake the drink but it was the same. I've made egg white whiskey sours at home before and it's not half foam. Servers were extremely nice about it tho. Food - fries and karagee were good. Pretty small menu and sushi selection was just okay. We mainly came for drinks. Nice place for a special occasion. Would I come again just for food and drinks? Probably not.,Beautiful rooftop ambience. Make sure to make a reservation because they're busy. Staff isn't that welcoming and they don't serve food at the bar only drinks- need table service for appetizers, etc. Asked a bartender what her recommendations are for their Signature Cocktails... she didn't really care to give us recommendations. Will come back to try their dinner menu, other than the rooftop views, the drinks are sub par and the staff isn't that welcoming.,Great place except for the two women who took selfies for the entire hour they were there. The food was awesome. Great view of the SF skyline. Great service. Great atmosphere. Highly recommend to check it out.,We came here after a Warriors game as it's walking distance from Chase. We had a reservation and were seated right away. The view at night was beautiful. As was the night itself. We all won.Highlights on the menu:SCALLOP TIRADITO japanese scallop, passionfruit leche de tigre, potato shoe string, smoked yam purée, chia, pickled red onion, cilantro oilPISCO SOURONE OF THE VEGGIE ROLLSWe had some bluefin tuna nigiris but surprisingly the vegetarian roll we ordered was our favorite. They had some rice-based whisky that was new to me and a favorite, too.,Been to Kaiyo twice now and it might be one of my new top restaurants/bars in the city. The first time I went just for drinks so I knew I needed to go back to try their food after seeing how amazing it looked. The service was a bit slower the first time I went but understandably so because I went on a Saturday night and it was packed. Between the views, food and drinks, and service during my second visit, this place is a solid 5/5.Some of my favorites:Space Adventure Cobra6/5 I typically don't like gin but this drink is phenomenal. If you like passion fruit and coconut crème, this is a must try. On top of how good it tastes, this drink is a crowd pleaser because of the  cute glass it comes in.Otoro5/5 If you like tuna, you'll love this.Chutoro6/5 This was my favorite! So smooth and delicious. Blufin Tuna Toast-5/5 So good! Just the right amount of crunch, avocado creme (so tasty) and fish. All of their fish was so fresh, you really can't go wrong with any of their sashimi or nigiri. I can't wait to go back and try their rolls.Pro Tips:You need to make a reservation if you want to order food. They get booked pretty quickly so go during the weekday if you can or book in advance if you're going on the weekend.It can get chilly so if you're not used to SF nights, bring a jacket.Definitely worth a try if you haven't been yet!,Came here on on the weekend a little bit before sunset and it wasn't too busy. Had to wait 10 min to go up but beat the rush. They sadly didn't have the fun decorative cups for my drink because they ran out.We just hung out at the bar and took pics of the skyline view but if you want a table you should make a reservation. Did see a few bigger groups there including one celebrating a bday.,This place has a great ambiance and lovely view, but it's is overpriced for what it is and the food isn't great. There's too much great food in the area to ruin a date night with bad food, so I'd suggest coming here for a drink before going to eat you real meal.,Aside from the wind, this is a great place to celebrate special occasions. We tried a few drinks and appetizers. Service was very efficient," although they could get pretty busy esp around 5pm which is obvious """"it's 5 o'clock somewhere"""" lol Minus 1 star because it's so hard to get here especially during peak hours. (We tried going right when they open but it we couldn't avoid the fact that traffic starts around that time) And if you're not staying at the hotel", you might find Parking upsetting. Nowadays you can't just park your car, you have to find a safe and decent garage which we found eventually.,Loved everything about KAIYO and can't wait to go back. The only downfalls are that it is a prettty penny and if you sat in the same spot my group did, by the entrance and away from the heat lamps," it will feel pretty cold. I walked onto the rooftop and immediately felt like I had been transported somewhere else. It looks like a lot of other """"aesthetic"""" and popular rooftops in other cities (think: NYC) but it feels so different for SF which is what I loved. Plus we don't have many rooftops here so it makes it even better! There's a variety of food options- my group got the shishito peppers ($8)", the Lima roll ($18), and Union Street Roll ($12). It was all insanely good and honestly, if it weren't for the price and how hard it is to get a reservation, I'd be back here everyday. The drinks ($16) are also delicious and I thoroughly enjoyed it! You get a gorgeous view of the city which is always appreciated. Go and enjoy some good food, funky cocktails, and an amazing view of the city!,What a fun spot! I've visited this location twice now - once for drinks at night and once for happy hour. There aren't many rooftop bars in the city so this is a nice spot to enjoy the city views. My favorite drink is the space adventure cobra - it's a sweet gin based tiki drink that comes in a cute mug! My coworkers mentioned that the pisco sour is good too!The happy hour was for a work event which we booked in advance. We got a nice space at the end of the rooftop. Our tables were reserved for our party but just keep in mind that other guests can still hang out in the area. The music was a bit loud when we arrived but the staff kindly adjusted the music so we were able to chat. The service was overall pretty good. Food wise, we shared a variety of small dishes including the kaarage, fried shrimp, edamame and yucca fries which were all yummy. The highlight was definitely the bluefin tuna avocado toast - so good!! I know this place is still very popular and reservations get snagged the day they are released so plan ahead!,This place is definitely worth the hype. I loved our drinks as it was definitely strong but didn't taste strong. I felt buzzed after two drinks and thats pretty rare at a lot of bars. I also get scared the drinks will taste too strong but they didn't here! We were able to get a same day reservation on a Wednesday on Resy. It is located in the Hyatt Hotel and theres a man in the front of the doors who will escort you to the rooftop. The service was good, some people were nicer than others. The food was good but nothing AMAZING. I have no complaints on the food but again it wasn't amazing to get a 5 star. I definitely would come back and recommend this place for some good drinks and good experience.,This place is very different and well organized according to other places. The food is amazing, music of your choice. The owner is very sweet... Ever the best café. The cost is fair for everything and the atmosphere is good.,Excellent food. Menu is extensive and seasonal to a particularly high standard. Definitely fine dining.,This was a lot of fun. I got to say, while there's a lot of good food in SF, it's not trivial to find a combination of good food and great ambiance, the kind that is fun, and makes the whole experience more uplifting. Kaiyo's Rooftop is it. Where the food didn't necessarily excel, the overall vibe compensated greatly.It was a double date, and we had a great time. The music is was mostly Latin, vibrant, the kind that gets the body moving.The food was mostly great, not mind-blowing, but great. Quick note, it's gets really chilly up on the rooftop, even with the heaters...so bring something warm to wear.For drinks, we started with the Pisco sours which didn't disappoint. These were well-balanced and potent.The better dishes we've had were the Nikkei oysters, the beef empanadas which were divine, and the Scallop Tiradito which was really fresh, acidic, flavorful, and just spot on. The ceviches were pretty good, but I've had better...I expected more in a Peruvian kitchen.We'll definitely go back here with friends, it's a fun, tasty restaurant, with small-medium size portions that are suitable for sharing.,This review is solely based on drinks because it's impossible to get a table for two. The bar welcomes anyone so it can be crowded. You might not be able to sit anywhere. Not really comfy and it's cold.  Some with heat lamps on top of them or next to them will be fine but if you're not standing next to one you'll be freezing.Service 5/5Super super nice waitress who walked around took order and left drinks. Service is pretty fast, even though the place was packed so props on them.  Bartenders are really nice too.Drinks 2/5: Literally ordered 4 cocktails and neither me or my friend really liked it. One of them was a little bit more than ok. It wasn't good so I don't even remember the names, but judging for this all the drinks are prob subpar which is a real disappointment because I love the other kaiyo location so much. The other locations cocktails were amazing.  Ambience 4/5:You get the view, but like I said it was cold and no seats unless you have reservations. Don't know if I like standing and sipping on cocktails in the cold that much.  More heat lamps is much needed.  Not just for guests dining. Guest standing around need some heat too.  Didn't get to try any food since it's reservations only for food. Maybe they should offer dining at the bar as reservations only, while the rest can stand in the standing places for cocktails only.   Prob would not go here since cocktails were disappointing, going to stick to the other kaiyo instead.,First of all- it was packed - make a reservation! And understand it's an outdoor restaurant on a roof with spectacular views of the city- so check the weather and bring a coat! It's on the roof of a hotel - street parking.  Easily accessible by public transportation.  The views are amazing - Baseball stadium, Bay Bridge, city skyline.   The service is excellent - friendly and fast even though the place was packed.  We never felt neglected.Everything is really good- we did apps, ceviche, a roll, cocktails.  Everything is delicious!Oysters- yummy- I prefer the ponzu," my companion the Tigre Empanada- rich beef and don't skimp on the dipping sauceJapanese shrimp- really light snd tasty Shrimp ceviche- yummy Blue fin toast- the toast is a rice cake - remember that because if you are expecting bread- it's not bread- it's tastySurf and turf roll- my friend was horrified but I loved it -- shrimp tempura with beef on top.  My friend is a sushi purist ... I'm ok with adding some beef :) Space Adventure Cobra- comes in a fun glass and really tasty ... like I would rerun just for this cocktail! It's on the sweet side so if you don't like sweet- but I do like sweet.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dumpling House,"Best dumplings ever.  Everything we tried on the menu has been excellent.  This is our third visit and each time the food is fantastic.,Dumpling House is probably my TOP choice for dumplings in the bay area. They are authentically made, served quick, excellent / friendly staff, and always delicious. Trust me on this one!The Pan Fried Turnip Cake is my favorite thing I've never had anything like it!,We went there today for lunch, because it was one of the few restaurants open on the Christmas Day. We ordered the black truffle Xiao Long Bao, the chicken wings, the pork and shrimp shumai, and the shrimp dumpling. All of the foods are authentic enough, but don't live up to the reviews. The soup dumplings has decent amount of soup (but not enough for the authentic good ones), and the dumpling dough is not particularly good. Please note that I am from Shanghai, so I might be extra picky. All other foods have similar quality to most of the Chinese restaurant, nothing is a bummer but nothing special either.,Pork BBQ buns were good, although the portions were a bit small. Truffle XLB baos were really unique and good! If you like truffles, this is a must-try experience. Wontons in chili oil were all right. Seaweed salad was fantastic, one of my favorite dishes here. Turnip cake was okay; it was a bit too wet and didn't hold together as well as other turnip cakes I've had, but the flavors were still good. Docking one star because the portions are fairly small for the prices. Bakeries sell these dim sum dishes in larger portions at lower prices...,Good dumplings and noodlesThis cosy eatery offers a nice selection of classic dumplings and noodles.  The chilli wontons and Hong Kong style wonton soup with noodles were perfect comfort food for a cool San Francisco January evening.,My new fav dumpling place. Delicious food, decent prices, good portions. There is nothing to dislike about this place. I have already eaten here four time since I found this place about 3 weeks ago, please don't judge I absolutely love the marinated cucumbers here. Fresh, crunchy and punchy. How can I not write some prose about the crab soup dumplings! Another must get. It's delicate but is brimming with delicate balanced flavor. I would not have been the one to ever order the Deep-fried meat dumpling but my fiancé did and it's delicious. The chewy mochi like skin with a thin layer of crispy skin, ugh so good! The meat is more on the sweeter side but there is just a little bit of it so I don't mind it as much. I think of this as dessert lol.Lastly I cannot not write about the Cream Custard Buns. Ultra soft and the filling is just creamiest and sweetest. It's like biting a pillowy cloud. Everything comes out max hot so be careful not to burn yourself. The food would tempt you no doubt but have some control and you shall be rewarded!I don't have a pic of it but another time I ordered the pepper salt chicken wings and it is also a must!,Fantastic dumplings of all kinds, Including vegetarian. Our favorites are the shrimp and leek,  and basically all the other shrimp ones! There is an excellent spinach and leek one too!Ambience is cozy and contemporary with perhaps a dozen tables. Service is fantastic and the dumplings come out very quickly! Spoiler alert: They recently started using an online reservation service that sometimes works and sometimes doesn't... So...If you don't feel like standing out in front for 20+ minutes, maybe give them a call!,I love this place and its location!  There aren't many great options for dim sum food outside of Chinatown so it's great to see one closer to the Castro district.  The place is small, but I was able to get in since it was off-peak hours.  Everything I had was delicious.  In particular, the radish cakes and the pan-fried dumplings stood out.  Will definitely drop by the next time I'm in town!,Make a reservation this place is small and gets busy. Food: good/ tasty Nice little place... you order on your phone and they bring the food out as it's ready. If your looking for a lot of attention this place is not the place, you order they bring the food, eat, pay and leave... lol. They do acknowledge you if you need them. I'll go back.,I've been on the hunt to find the best dumplings in San Francisco and this place is definitely in my top 5!The pork XLB were very soupy but fell apart quite easily! A solid 9/10!The truffle XLB were very unique and nothing like anything I've ever tasted before- 10/10!The green beans were great! 10/10 for sure!Overall the service here was quick and good as well. A good spot for some mouth watering XLB and wontons,My apologies I meant to review Dumpling Home-Probably the best food I have tried in a long time: the second I tasted the cucumber salad I was sent to heaven and back again - Then the mushroom salad was fabulously unique in taste that you just want to savor each bite. The dumplings were delightful and the crispy chicken wings to die for. It was worth the 45 minute wait. Service was spot on and the ambiance was filled with foodies who knew what's great. A whole in the wall place worth trying.,The Pan Fried Buns here were amazing. Crispy without being oily, and plenty of filling inside a soft bun. The Turnip Cake and Wontons with Chili were good as well. Marinated Cucumbers were a little stronger and spicier than I'm used to, and the Xiao Long Bao was difficult to eat inside the foil cups. Ordering on the website was slightly confusing, but wasn't too slow.,We were craving some dim sum in the city after an afternoon of shopping and came here based off of the good reviews. We ordered four items off the menu: cucumbers, pan-fried turnip cakes, shrimp and peak dumplings, and traditional XLBs. There wasn't anything that made the food stand out. Everything was just ""okay"". I had to ask for vinegar and ginger because that's how XLBs are normally served! I was surprised that they didn't come with the dish normally. We also asked for spoons to eat the XLB with. Chopsticks weren't going to do. The XLBs were also super small compared to other places I've been to before. Overall, overpriced for mediocre food.,This restaurant is probably in my top 3 in SF! The service is fast, the staff is amazing, and the food is delicious. Before I go into the rankings, let me just say all the food was DELICIOUS! We spent about $25/person including tax/tip. I'd definitely come here again. I'd also recommend putting yourself on the Yelp Waitlist 10ish mins before you arrive so you don't have to wait too long in line when you arrive at the restaurant. Here's what we got:Original XLB: 9/10 I just absolutely love XLB and this one hit the mark. It was juicy and hot on the inside and soft and warm on the outside. Cream Custard Buns: 8.5/10 This rounded off the meal perfectly! The creamy custard was just oozing when we bit into the buns. Shrimp Toast: 8/10 Crunchy and flavorful! The sauce on top complimented the toast well!Seafood Potstickers: 8/10Fresh Shrimp and Leek Dumplings: 7/10House White Wine: 7/10,What an excellent choice by my dining partner.  Anthony, not so much a yelper, knew the 4.5 out of 5 stars would impress me. Lol.  We were BOTH pleasantly impressed at the variety and quality of the food as well as the cute space of this eatery.While portions are not so big, the good prices offset that.  I prefer it this way so we could try a variety of items!  The lunch special is definitely the way to go here.  For only $14.95 you get a full size of dumplings of your choice (from a limited menu), an Appetizer, and a iced or hot tea.  We got two lunch specials trying:Scallion pancakes - 4.5/5 thinner than most, made for a tasty, crispy treat,Eggrolls - 4/5 perfectly crispy and delicious,Spinach dumplings - 5/5 undescribably delicious! Spinach is the wrap.  Filling is mushrooms and veges,Pork and cabbage dumplings - 4/5 smaller than most yet a generous portion,Added on an order of crab XLB - 4.5/5 juicy, flavorful, served with high quality black vinegar and shredded ginger.Return and repeat!  In fact, Anthony is already planning his return with his significant other soon!  Located in the Castro District on Noe Street where parking is metered or free on the street.  Just 1.5 blocks away from Hot Cookies...another must stop while in the area...but that is for another mention!  Thank you Anthony and Dumpling House for delicious meal and memorable time.,Made a reservation for 2 on Monday night for Tuesday @ 7pm with ease! When we arrived, we were seated immediately. I was surprised this place existed tbh! It's really hard to spot since there are big trees in front of the reastaurant. Service was great and quick. You order through a QR code and they bring it out to you within 10-15 mins.I absolutely loved everything we tried! We ordered the pork and corn dumplings, fresh shrimp and leek dumplings and the Noodles with Pork in Fried Bean Paste. They stuff the dumplings with a lot of meat, despite it looking so small. I would come back again to try new things!,The staff was very attentive and everything we had was delicious! We arrived at 10:30 am and were part of the first group to be seated, I think the line started to get long at around 11 so come early if you don't want to wait to be seated for too long.We tried the pork xiao long bao, pork pan fried dumplings as well as the chicken ones. Additionally, we also tried the green beans and the dan dan noodles. I think my favorite dumplings were the pork pan fried dumplings, they were so tasty and had a crispy bottom. The green beans and dan dan noodles were also very tasty. The dan dan noodles had a savory nutty taste in the sauce. I can't wait to come back!,I'm going to be completely honest.. coming here was an accident because there is a Dumping HOUSE and a Dumpling HOME both in SF! Both also not too far from each other. welp, not surprising I got them mixed up BUT honestly pt2 I'm glad I did. Already seated until I realized it was the wrong restaurant when looking at the menu. Could have left but didn't because ""what if"" this spot is good.. Surprise!! the food was really good! Would recommend and will come back.Ordering will be through a QR code and they will bring the food to your table. Sometimes I like this method so you do not need to flag anyone down, just order whenever you're ready. I'm not sure if this is the only option when dining in, this is just based on my first visit. Fresh Pork and Shrimp Shumai - goodLeek with Shrimp dumplings - one of my favorites here!! Started with 3 pieces then had to order a second round and chose 8 pieces. The 8 pieces were made differently than the three pieces. 8 pieces seemed a little smaller and I liked the chewy texture dumpling wrapper from the 3 pieces but that's just my opinion. Filing was delicious regardless Wonton with Chili Sauce - this is noted as ""spicy"" but it was not even close to spicy. I thought these were okay, the wontons were good but the chili sauce could be better. & last but not least!! XLB!! (Xiao Long Bao aka Soup Dumplings!) These were amazing and the amount of soup in each one.. wow.-Pork XLB - good-Black Truffle XLB omg what a game changer!!! by far the tastiest XLB I've ever eaten. Nice earthy taste, delicious.Enjoyed this spot so much, can't wait to come back and try the rest of their menu plus get more Black Truffle XLB!,Such a great spot for dumplings! Came for a late lunch with friends and found a new favorite place. Service was great and our waitress was so sweet. We ordered 2 lunch specials which was perfect to share between 3 people. With the 2 lunch specials we got 2 orders of bbq pork buns, the wontons in chili sauce, pork and cabbage dumplings, and the pan fried  meat and vegetable buns.  I loved that the lunch special came with tea, it paired nicely with the meal. All of the food was good especially the wontons with chili sauce. The ambiance was nice and friendly and the TVs displaying people making food was  nice.,The soup dumplings are not as unctuous as I've had, and come in tiny muffins tins. Ordering is completely via their scan code menu. Restroom is clean. I like to use soul paddles for soup dumplings, which were not on offer. But, it was tasty and fresh. I especially enjoyed the black truffle XLB (soup dumplings), and the pan fried turnip cakes.,I arrived on a holiday weekend and checked in via Yelp ahead of time for a party of 6. I was surprised there wasn't a long wait!| i n t e r i o r |The restaurant interior was quite small so we had to wait for a group to leave since there was only 1 table that could accommodate a party as large as ours. | f o o d |You order by scanning a QR code which was really convenient. Multiple people can participate and add to the table's order too. Most dishes were traditional ones that you'd find at the dim sum restaurant. Here's everything we ordered: original XLB, shu mai, shrimp ha gow, pork w/ cabbage dumplings, turnip cake, pan-fried veggie & meat buns, and garlic green beans. My top 3 would have to be:1. Shrimp Ha Gow (crystal shrimp dumpling): amazingly one of the best ha gow I've had so far?! The dumpling skin was chewy and thin unlike most places. 2. Shu Mai (fresh shrimp w/ pork dumplings): so savory - YUM3. Pork w/ Cabbage Dumplings: yes they're basic boiled dumplings, but the texture and flavor of the CABBAGE really made it for me. | t l ; d r |Great option if you're looking for pretty decent sit-down dim sum! You won't get the true experience of the ladies with their carts, but the food is pretty good.,This was my favorite stop on my SF trip this time around! Staff was very nice and all food came out promptly. Note: Not pictured but we also ordered the pan-fried vegetable dumplings. If you get those, order them first because the staff informed us its the dish that takes the longest to cook ! Definitely worth the wait. Due to the variety of fillings and the various of wrappers, each dish had their own unique texture that made you want to keep eating more ! My personal favorite this time around was the chili wonton dish. To round out the meal, we also ordered oolong tea which comes in a very cute clear pot with matching cups. One downside was the Black truffle XLB didn't taste any different from a regular XLB in my opinion. Nevertheless, it was still piping hot and delicious! Can't wait to be back.,Not the best dim sum I've had in SF... the restaurant itself is clean and modern, but the service was very very slow and the dim sum is quite Americanized. The dim sum isn't terrible, but everything was only okay and seemed heavy on the MSG. It took over 15 minutes for just one dish to come out, which was a bit frustrating. We ordered the XLB, which was not very good (a little tasteless)--they came on the little tin foil cups and we didn't get any soup spoons to use, which felt a little inauthentic. The pork and cabbage boiled dumplings were very heavy on the chives/cabbage and I almost thought they accidentally gave us veggie dumplings. The shu mai wasn't bad though--each dumpling was large and full of shrimp and pork. The wonton noodle soup was also decent. The sesame balls were ok, in my opinion there wasn't enough sesame filling. I liked that there was no wait when we came in on a Saturday for lunch. But I am not sure that I'd come back, especially since the dishes took a very long time to come out and I thought everything was only mediocre.,Very creative dishes yet with authenticity. The truffle soup dumplings definitely got us curious. The turnip cakes were properly oily and fresh. Shumai was satisfying. And oh man, how I miss the taste of cream custard buns! Interesting that they are orange-ish here, but the flavor is just right.,I love this place! They got great dumplings, I also tried the vegetarian menu its amazing. I think this is one of the best dumpling place I visited.,Back again for dinner tonight:On point: - XLBs- Wonton with chili sauceLess so: Pork and cabbage dumplings,Best dumplings ever super delicious. Everything we tried on the menu has been excellent.,A truly wonderful surprise on Noe street. Burned off all those calories at Barry's? Done with your tour at the Randall Museum ? Perfect, mosey your way down to the Dumpling House and take a seat in this contemporary dim sum restaurant. Now, if you are used to Good Mong Kok bakery, City view, or Palette Tea House I advise you to let go of the traditional environment of dim sum. This place has a more tech-savvy approach where you can order everything at the table and your food comes in waves of drinks, appetizers, main dishes, and desserts. You can order as much as you want at your fingertips! The staff is very friendly and the chefs work magic behinds the scenes. Don't let the technology discourage you, the authenticity of the dim sum rings true here! I would recommend for a small group of 4:1) Garlic string beans $8.502) Fresh shrimp and celery dumplings $9.95(2)3) Crystal shrimp dumplings $7.95(2)4) Shrimp and pork shu mai $7.95(2)5) Scallion pancakes $5.956) shrimp toast $9.957) cream custard bun $6.95Then you can also pay at your table and go on your way! A stress-free dim sum experience haha Create food memories,Isabelle Pinard,Wow! I was hesitant to try the Pork & Sweet Corn Dumplings but they were delicious. Loved the hint of sweetness and the texture that it added to the filling. I also tried their Shrimp Toast at the recommendation of a coworker and everyone agreed that this was the highlight of our meal. Can't remember what the sauce was but it tasted like a sriracha mayo and complemented the savory, crispy youtiao (chinese donut stick) perfectly - it's an unexpected combo but well executed. BBQ pork buns and XLB were mid but I'd definitely come back for dumplings and the shrimp toast!,Dumpling house is great for a late night bite. They're open til 9pm, and have fair prices. My favorite dish was the pan fried vegetable and meat buns that have a fried bun texture on the outside with juicy meat and vegetables on the inside. The Xiao long bao were good, but not the best I've had. The best Xiao long bao is when it burns your mouth from the soup being hot, but this was not the case for these Xiao long bao. The last dish I tried was the wonton in chili oil, and this one was great as well, but I wish the chili oil wasn't so watered down, and it could've been slightly spicier.,The dumplings were on the smaller size, but they were delicious.Got the shrimp and leek, the truffle XLB and the regular XLB.I think I would like my dumplings bigger. Flavorful.,Food is good! My favorite was the wontons in chili sauce. It was the right amount of kick. The wonton wrapper wasn't too thick or chewy. The filling to wonton wrapper ratio was ideal for my friends and I. I would skip the regular Xiao long bao for the crab Xiao long bao. The crab ones had more flavor. The xlb were like gushers for sure! The Siu Mai were alright. All we had were dumplings, so I'm not sure how their noodle dishes are, but I'm sure they're pretty good too. I would definitely come back especially for the chili wontons. Man I'm just drooling thinking about them. Yes, they're that good to me!,My friend and I visited here before going to a concert. I made a reservation for 6:30, but it wasn't very busy, which was a pleasant surprise. There were only two other tables occupied when we arrived. Given covid times, I won't complain!We were seated and ordered via the QR code at the table. Our first order included: marinated cucumbers, char siu bao, original XLB, and crab meat XLB. The cucumbers were great--I would order again. Had a good mix of salty, sesame oil, and acid. The char siu bao was good, pretty standard. Both of the XLBs were good, and enjoyable. We requested extra ginger, which they brought quickly. After finished, we also ordered the wontons, via the online ordering system. The software was very user-friendly and easy to figure out. Both my friend and I thought the wontons were the highlights of the meal. This was definitely not anticipated, ha! The dough had a nice texture, the sauce was savory deliciousness, and the filling was flavorful. Would definitely order more wontons!When we finished, we let one of the wait staff know we needed the check and the process was pretty quick and easy. I kinda liked the hybrid of online ordering and traditional close out. By the time we left there were more people enjoying their meals, so it did get busier after 7:30.,Cozy restaurant with great variety on XLB - really enjoyed the black truffle one! All the other dishes we got were executed well. House sake was also good.,Awesome. If you crave dumplings this place is legit.ordered randomly and it was good. This place doesn't have long lines against the one in Taraval st. It's cleaner too. You order on your phone and they deliver the food. It eliminates being lost in translation. Highly recommended!,Really loved all the dishes here. Stand outs were definitely the soup dumplings and spicy wontons. Both had incredible flavours, but no complaints about anything! Would rightly recommend especially if you don't want to drive to the Richmond or China Town for good dim sum.,Dumpling House Ratings: 3.8/5Food: 3.5/5 - Another dinner date with my boyfriend to satisfy our cravings for soup dumplings, wonton soups, and buns. You know we love our CARBS. This place has solid and tasty dumplings in Castro area, but nothing too mind blowing. We end up ordering 5 things to share, see descriptions below: - wontons w/ chili sauce [TRY]: Comes with 8 pork and cabbage wontons. The wonton skins were a bit soggy, and fillings was bland. I was disappointed from their chili sauce, it was not spicy at all and lack spices, definitely could be spicier with more flavors, but it was okay. - pan-fried veggie and meat buns [TRY]: My favorite dish of the night. Buns was fried so crispy, but when you bite into it, it's still pillowy and soft. There's pork and cabbage in the fillings, but it was also quite bland. Pro tip, dip the buns in vinegar they provide from the soup dumplings, if not ask for some vinegar, because this is the only correct way to enjoy pan-fried buns.- cream custard buns [TRY]: Get this for dessert, you will not regret it. The fillings was hot and oozing out when we bite into it. The buns itself was super soft and pillowy, amazing texture. The only downside is that the filling was too sweet for me, so I made my boyfriend ate the other one, but he loves it.- crabmeat xlb [SKIP]: Size is smaller than regular soup dumplings, definitely not impressed by them. There weren't that much broth inside, and not much crab flavors. Tasted more like those Costco frozen soup dumplings, rather then freshly handmade soup dumplings. Cannot compare to the ones I have in NYC. - HK style wontons w/ soup [SKIP]: Comes with 8 pork and shrimp wontons with a decent amount of fillings. The soup itself was bland, even after adding soy sauce to it. It comes with some bok choy; definitely a perfect dish if you want something warm. Ambiance: 4/5 - Cute little Asian dim sum place with a causal and cozy vibe right on Noe. There's plenty of tables and seats available for indoor dining. It is clean and brightly-lit with staffs walking in and out of the kitchen. Expect this place to be loud and bussing, since it is an Asian restaurant. They also check for vaccination card and ID if you want to dine-in. Price: 3.75/5 - I think prices are on the higher end, since you can find similar or better food in Chinatown, but it's worth it for the location, I guess. Depending what you order, each dish can range from $5.50 to $11.95 more or less. Our bill came up to be around $45 before tips for a total of 5 things. Service: 3.75/5 - They got a seamless ordering system going on. We scanned the QR code, select what we want, and submit the order with the table number. The servers will then bring out the food. At the end, they will bring the bill to you for you to pay. The only downside that night is that the food took a while to come out, a lot longer than expected. BLUF: Good dumplings and wontons spot at a reasonable price. Will come back when I am craving for some Asian comfort food. I want to try their dumplings next time. I recommend the pan-fried veggie and meat buns and the cream custard buns. Make sure to get on the Yelp waitlist before you head to the restaurant to avoid a wait.,Food was absolutely stunning. Staff was so attentive but not annoyingly so. And I loved the cozy environment. Got the bbq pork buns, xiao long bao, wonton with chili sauce, pork and cabbage dumplings, pepper chicken wings, pan fried vegetable and meat dumplings. Everything was so delicious my favorite was actually the wings. But the spicy wontons were a close second. Can't wait to come back!,Right off the bat, I loved how our table could order directly off the iPad menu instead of having to call over a server. This made the experience more efficient. The vegetarian pot stickers and spinach dumplings tasted great, but also not very filling. I had 2 spinach dumpling orders and 1 veggie pot sticker order and the total cost came out to ~30 dollars which imo is a little pricey given the amount of food. Other than that, food and vibes were lovely. Also the bathroom was quite clean which is always a plus!,Love this place. Amazing. I can't give it a better review. It's relatively inexpensive for sharing around the table. It's not Chinatown hole in wall cheap, but the quality is much better in my opinion.They can get really busy, like by 630pm on a Friday prepare to put your name on a wait list. They can get backed up, but please be patient as all restaurants are understaffed in the pandemic. Even Sunday evening, they've got a full house.It's cheap enough that you should continue to go back and try everything on the menu. My favorites are the BBQ Pork Bun steamed (char sui bao), the sauteed meat and veggie bun, the truffle soup dumpling and the cream custard bun for dessert.You order on a QR code which is nice to continue ordering more food if you're hungry. Support your local dim sum house!My star rating:5  - must go!!! 4 - liked it, give it a try!3  - it was alright2  - I probably won't go back 1  - turnaround and run,My husband and I had dinner with a friend on Saturday night. I really wanted to eat dumplings, so I chose this place for the good reviews, but also because it offers different variants with seafood and vegetables (I don't eat pork).We shared different dumplings:- crystal shrimps- spinach - chicken and corn - shrimps and pork Others:- spring rolls- seafood pot stickers Everything was absolutely delicious! I didn't try the one with shrimps and pork, but my husband and our friend really enjoyed it. I really liked the crystal shrimps and the spinach. Maybe my least favorite was the one with chicken and pork, but it was good though.I didn't eat the spring rolls, because for me they were too oily.My favorite one was the seafood pot stickers. It was amazing, also my husband loved it. In fact we ordered it twice.The location is nothing special, but one of the girl was helpful about explaining how to order (you order through the qrcode on the table, easy and fast).,i would highly recommend this place for these 3 reasons: 1) affordable pricing (read further for breakdown or look at my receipt photo attachment), 2) decent portions, 3) cleanliness please review the receipt i attached because there were way too many dishes to write individual reviews on, especially since all the dishes were great or at minimum a good standard for what you would expect for the dish, but i will highlight the ones i loved the most! GREEN BEANS: crunchy, tender, succulent! what more could you ask for? they weren't too salty either - a definitely great appetizer that was more than enough to feed my party of 4! SPICY WONTONS:  super good. so delicious. wish i could bathe in the sauce. we actually used the spicy wonton sauce to dip our dumplings into it before they took away the plate. not too spicy, not too salty, not too sweet, the wontons were perfectly stuffed, we didn't feel cheated that there was excess wrapper! PORK AND CORN & SHRIMP AND CORN DUMPLINGS: they really folded these so well! the wrapper was thin and the stuffing was just enough, it was a truly well balanced dumpling. they added so much corn too it was truly magical since i find most places skimp on the corn / stuffing! PRICING: we ordered 2 rounds of food, left a 20% tip, and the total for each party member was $33 which i think is reasonable for the amount of food, the city, etc. TLDR: 12/10 - added to my circle of restaurants to visit when i'm in the area again!!,I ordered from here for delivery, and really enjoyed the food. I got the garlic green beans, wontons with chili sauce, and xiao long bao. The green beans were super tasty and crunchy and the wontons were the perfect level of spice for me! I really enjoyed my food and will definitely order those again or visit in person when I can. However, there was unfortunately a mistake with the xiao long bao and I received the pan-fried vegetable and meat buns instead. They were really apologetic and nice when I called saying they would refund me. I look forward to trying the xiao long bao when I can!,My 1st dumpling restaurant and I loved it. I compare it to a Spanish tapas. Lots of small sharing plates. We had shrimp & lobster chips and they are so addicting. Every dish we tried was delicious and we enjoyed each bite. Although it's my 1st visit to a dumpling house I gave it 5-stars because the food was delish, the service was wonderful, the place was cute & clean, and joining the waitlist with Yelp was so convenient. Bottom line...great!,This place seems like a too good to be true spots but it did not disappoint! Starting off by saying I knocked the one star because I did in fact wait 2 hours for a table which I get it's a small space even with them having seats outside. I also did arrive at peak time around 6:50pm and was not seating until 9pm once they were closed which I still appreciate being seated but the wait was insane . They also do close the waiting around 7:30 so do not show up at that time on a Saturday because you will not be waitlisted they however will still allow takeout orders! We had come here after being in SF al day since we live about an hour and a half away from the city. The food was some of the best dumplings and XLB we had mainly pork options but one chicken and out of all I would rank the boiled dumplings with pork our favorite. The cucumber salad was a nice pallet cleanser as it was very refreshing. My favorite thing about this place is all the pork options tasted different nothing tasted the same even if it was pork which I didn't expect because at din tai fung just about everything pork taste the same. We definitely ordered a lot for 2 since I even had enough to go home and then ate the next day and they still tasted great!! Ever since I ate here I think about it just about everyday I'll definitely be back ASAP. Must try! The staff was also very helpful and I appreciated them for still letting us enjoy our meal after they close. The cut off order time is also 8:45 so they took our orders before we were seated and our food was so fast! Definitely try it if you're in town.,My friend and I were in the mood to try an item from each menu category, so we enjoyed the pork and cabbage dumplings, original xiao long bao, wonton with chili sauce, garlic green beans, sesame balls, and shrimp toast. Dumplings, XLB, and wonton were good, and although portion sizes felt light, they were still substantive enough to be the center of our meal. Green beans were also tasty, stir fried to the perfect degree and fresh but with a satisfying crunch. Shrimp toast was a fun addition and sesame balls were standard fare. Overall, we liked the clean and cozy atmosphere and would come back for a yummy, casual bite.,One of my favorite dumpling spots in the Castro. My favorites are the pork and sweet corn, wonton and chili oil, and the spinach and shrimp. They have online table ordering service, so if you want to you can scan a QR code and choose the items you want delivered to your table.,Love coming here - I've gotten so many of their items and have been happy with each. I've had their dumplings, the soups, vegetable dishes, you name it. There is a bit of a line, so use the Yelp wait line feature!,The pork BBQ buns were good, although the portions were a bit small. The Truffle XLB baos were really unique and good! If you love truffles, this experience is a must try. The wontons in chili oil were perfect. The seafood salad was fantastic, one of my favorite dishes here. The turnip cake was fine. It was ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 bit too wet and didn't go as well as the turnip cake, but the flavors were still good.Docking one star because the portions are quite small for the prices. Bakeries sell these dim sum dishes in large portions at low prices.,Wait: I went on a Saturday around 4 pm, no wait! We were seated right away. COVID: Vaccination cards mandatory to eat inside - much appreciated! Menu is also scannable and I think you pay right on the website. Food: super good dumplings. The shrimp dumplings were really good, and so was the green beans! We also got vegetable dumplings, black truffle XLB, and pork steamed buns. The truffle XLB tasted most like ginger to me, but maybe my dumpling wasn't that flavorful because my sister said the truffle flavor was really strong.Solid place to eat!,Whoa, did not expect a lot from this place- i was wrong on my assumptions on the food, everything we order did not disappoint us, it was sooo good. Definitely we will come back!,Delicious. Good customer service! Make a reservation because they don't usually take walk ins! The XLBs are my favorite and the spicy won tons,I tried eating here since  it's just next door from where i get my haircut at u-niq cuts and julie also recommended it and yes the dumpling is superb... Definitely coming back here.,Everything was delicious hot and fresh the customer service was great we finished off with a dessert and had the cream custard buns they were phenomenal Delicioso!! Not from this area but definitely have to come for some more dumplings!!,Awesome food with a mellow atmosphere.  The shrimp dumplings are delish!!!  BBQ pork puns is also delish!!!  The whole menu is the best!!!  Service is great!!!  Quick friendly service!!  A cute clean spot!!  A must visit!!!,This place had respectable dim sum and dumplings although on the expensive end. Not sure if I'd come here again but it was convenient for a quick bite to eat.,Sometimes you wake up and choose dumplings.  This time I wish I had just waited for Dumpling Baby to open.  Alas," we ordered takeout from Dumpling House and we waited a while for them to """"text that the order was ready"""" but that text never came so we had to insist on it.  Anyway", the wonton soup comes with the wonton already in the soup, which made for mushy wonton.  I was really amped to try the truffle soup dumpling but that was also a tad disappointing.  The mung bean noodle, also disappointing, not much flavor.  And everything else was just okay.  Might be a better experience actually eating there, but regardless of dine-in or take-out the flavor should still be there.,OVERALLThis is my favorite XLB spot in the Bay! The boiled dumplings were also super solid but I think you can find similar quality at other spots as well. All the Baos fillings were well seasoned and super juicy!Spicy Pig Ear 5/5I lovvvve pig ear and this one was done really well! It could've been a bit more spicy / saucy but overall delicious!Beef Tongue 3/5This one I wasn't super impressed by - could've been seasoned slightly moreBrussel Sprouts 3/5Nothing to write home about, I personally like my Brussel sprouts more on the crispy / charred side which these weren't.Boiled Dumplings 5/5Just overall solid! Nothing super special about them though.Original XLB 5/5This one was amazing, super juicy, delicious!Spicy XLB + Crab XLB 3/5These were pretty gimmicky. The ma la one especially. The crab and the spicy one take away from the juicy flavor.Juicy Pork Bao 5/5Amazing! Probably the best version I've had of this dish in America! Fried to perfection!,Tasty dim sum and dumplings for a great price! The dumplings remind me of home, and I recommend the wonton noodle soup for some authentic comfort food. Honestly it was the perfect meal for a chilly, cloudy day in the city. The service was on the slow side but our waiter apologized, and she made sure to check in with our table.,We walked to this place as we were craving dumplings on a beautiful sunny day in SF. There is a wait depending on how busy it is and the time of the day. We went around 2 in the afternoon, we were a party of 5. We didn't have much wait, probably around 5 mins for the servers to give us our table.They had decent options for dumplings. We ended up ordering Chicken and Corn Dumpling, Shrimp Crispy Wonton, Pork Soup Dumpling, Crispy prawn bread, Large Sake.The ordering system is a bit unique, you don't order to a person. There is an app that you login and everyone in the table needs to update what they want to the table cart and press order once all the food is added.The Food Arrived quick. The Servers were friendly. The taste of the dumplings was good. The food was served hot and it was flavorful.This place seems a bit small for large groups. But it is ok for groups of 5-6 people. Also, they only split the whole check into two ways.Also, the custard buns for deserts was very good. The Custard melted in the mouth.Overall, it was a decent experience. You would need to find the parking as it can be tricky, we ended up finding a street parking couple of blocks away.,We got delivery and ordered the pork and corn dumplings, seafood potstickers, xlb, crystal shrimp, and BBQ pork baos. Bbq pork baos were ok but smaller than expected. All of the dumplings were great. The xlb got a little crushed but everything still tasted fantastic! Some of the best dumplings in the city - chewy, yummy dough with good filling ratio. The prices are also good, will be ordering again.,Our family went to 5 mom and pop small businesses on Saturday Nov. 27, 2021 supporting small businesses day.  Our last place was one of the best place. We call it our hidden gem in SF.  Of all the dumplings and dim sum places in San Francisco, Dumpling House is a place that knows how to execute both dumplings and dim sum.  The selection of dim sum is not extensive.  But what they do, they do it very well.  Same holds true for their dumplings. Perfect texture of the dumpling skin. All the food is not salty and we did not get the MSG after effect (I can't say the don't use MSG). The nice thing is that you can order dim sum any time of the day/evening.  So if you live in SF and have the urge for some delicious dim sum, give Dumpling House a call.  DJ's rating 4.6/5.0.  Would I come back? Definitely Yes.,We ordered their shrimp toast in which for about $10, it didn't have much shrimp topping on top of a Chinese fried doughnut cut into 4 pieces. Won't order that again but would come back to try other dishes. We ate pork and corn dumplings and shrimp and vegetable dumpling soup. One of the dumplings didn't have any shrimp in the filling. We ordered the pan fried meat filled buns. We would come back to try other dishes that we didn't eat this time around to give this place a chance!,The service was great and the waitress was super sweet. The food was good but nothing mind blowing. The bbq pork baos, veggie spring rolls, and little crab things were good but I probably won't get again. The ambiance was cute inside.,Their XLB are one of the best I've had in San Francisco. Thin skin, flavorful. Not too big. Dumplings are also excellent. Supple skin, melts in your mouth goodness. Everything is made to order, so be patient.,I enjoyed the lunch specials and the service was so sweet to us because we both fumbled ordering via our phones  (they have you scan the menu and order off your phone).  I'll know how to do it next time.Spinach dumplings with veggies insideSpicy wontonsPork bunsScallion pancakeShrimp and chive dumplings Shrimp toastMango pudding Everything was great.  And it comes with iced tea.  And I like the ambriance inside with a brick wall and decorations.,Amazing food, service, and setting. We had amazing buns and dumplings. I  suggest Dumpling House. Randall,their dumplings were so good. I got all the pescatarian options on the menu and it was delicious! definitely recommend,Home is where the har gow is. Dumpling House is such a hidden gem. From the black truffle XLB to the perfectly pan-fried crispy turnip cake to the most flavorful shrimp & leek har gow - the consistently great quality, hand-made dim sum makes this spot a go-to of mine!,I really enjoyed this spot. I came here for a solo dinner after finishing my homework and some regular work on a Saturday. I was surprised it wasn't busy because I've walk by before and it's usually pretty packed. I got a couple things here. I ordered cucumbers, pan fried veggie and meat bun, chicken wings, and soup dumplings. The soup dumplings were fine; they got the job done. I absolutely loved the veggie and meat bun. The cucumber was a great way to change up my flavor palette as I was eating everything else. And I absolutely loved the wings! This seems like it'd be a cute casual date spot but seems fun for any occasion if you're with a small group of friends.,Wow this place is bomb! Great dumpling spot off of Market street. We got the classic soup dumplings, crab soup dumplings, and wontons with chili oil. Be sure to order via scanning QR code for faster service. Would definitely come back.,We joined the waitlist before arriving at the restaurant and were therefore promptly seated. The ordering system is through the phone, you scan the QR code and add the order to your cart. Multiple people can add to the cart because you receive a table number which goes on all the orders. One of our party was vegetarian, and ordered the spinach dumplings and the vegetable noodle soup both of which she enjoyed. The spinach dumplings were pricey considering there were only four in an order.As for the carnivorous options, all were delicious and comforting. The pork and cabbage dumplings were light and flavorful and we ended up getting two orders despite feeling full. We also loved the wontons in chili oil. We got the barbecue pork buns which were soft and a great balance between sweet and savory. The pepper chicken wings were the only things we didn't love but were still decent. I'm looking forward to visiting this place again.,Very enjoyable and tasty food.  The service could use some improvement but that could be due to staffing issues. Though the food is excellent.,Will not come back. Came at 6PM ish on Sunday when it didn't look that crowded but we were treated poorly. The waitress wasn't attentive and was a bit clumsy. We also waited 30+ minutes for our food. The food was eh, nothing special,overall a solid tasty dumpling spot @ a reasonable price! we ordered for to go & our food was ready for pick up within 20 minutes, super quick & easy.the food:Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings ($8.95): good flavor! not overly salty, lost some of the crunch but expected since it was to go 8/10HK Style Wonton Noodles ($10.95): not the best, was pretty bland even after adding hot sauce to it, 5/10 would probably skip next time 5/10 Original Xiao Long Bao/Soup Dumplings ($8.50): pretty good! One order came with 6 dumplings! All of them retained a lot of the soup, and were very juicy and flavorful 8.5/10 Garlic Broccoli ($8.50): solid flavor, hard to go wrong when with garlic 8/10Spicy Wonton ($8.95): yum! good portion, came with 8 wontons. Tasted like there was cabbage inside which I wasn't used to for this dish. would have been better if eaten right away since the skin was a little soggy, but again, we knew what we were getting w/ ordering to go. Also, wasn't spicy at all despite the chili pepper next to its name! 9/10 Marinated Cucumber ($5.50): I was a big fan! Very solid appetizer lots of flavor. Heads up though, definitely had a little kick despite no spice warning (like was definitely spicier than the spicy wonton ^) 9/10jiajiang mian ($10.95): I liked the sauce, but the noodle texture was a little unusual to me, definitely wasn't bad but I'd probably skip next time 6.5/10 Pork & Corn Dumplings ($8.50): my personal fav dish, one order came with 8 dumplings! the skin was the perfect thickness & was SO good. Each dumpling was bursting with corn and pork and was super flavorful, reminded me of dumplings from taiwan!! 10/10Our total came out to $77.60 for 4 people which definitely wasn't bad considering how much food there was! We were all left satisfied & still had leftovers. would definitely come back whenever I'm craving some solid dumplings, but would probably opt to dine in instead of getting take out to try out all the food fresh!,"Everything is """"just a little unexpected"""" in some way", like the filling might have some ingredient you don't usually see. That said, it's not overly greasy, not trying to add any weird twists, just trying to do the most basic thing well, and I would prefer this over just about every dumpling restaurant in San Francisco.,Stopped in here on a recommendation from a friend. Came here back in January and there was a vaccine requirement. I'm assuming it's no longer in effect but can't say for sure up in SF. Took just a short time to be seated when we arrived. For some reason the door kept getting stuck open and this restaurant was absolutely freezing while we ate our dinner. Everyone in there had 2-3 layers on and looked uncomfortable while having dinner. People would come in for pick up orders and leave the door wide open again and again. Not their fault at all though. Service here was great and the food was amazing. I think we might have ordered too much as usual but it was a great variety of food from some delicious soup dumplings to soup and also had some hot tea to warm us from the inside out. Very nice hidden gem of a restaurant while visiting San Francisco. Would definitely come back here again when we swing through and are wanting some really good food in the area. Highly recommend if you are a hungry for dumplings and soup!,Great menu choices good fast friendly service tasty at reasonable prices plan ahead as it's a popular place so expect a wait but worth the wait,Food might be okay here but service is the worst of the worst. You can stand there waiting for your order for 40 mins but they won't even acknowledge you're standing there.,After we watched movie at Castro Theater , my family come to Dumpling house for dinner. We ordered lots food. They are all delicious!  Our favorite included Marinated cucumber, Wonton chili sauce. (This is so good! I think it is the best Wonton in the SF! ) Fresh shrimp leek dumpling, Pan Fried vegetable meat bun. For dessert, we had Sesame balls and Mango. We also had Spinach dumpling, fresh shrimp port dumpling and Pepper Salt chicken wing and Hong Kong style wonton soup. We loved this place! This would be our go to place after movie at Castro Theater.,I came by on Friday noon trying to get lunch. They have lunch special but it's only for dine in. I ordered wontons with chili sauce, scallion pancake, and turnip cake. The turnip cake is my favorite since it's crispy on the outside and really soft inside, the only thing is that it's a bit greasy. The scallion pancake is the same but I can't really taste the scallion. The wonton itself was good, but the chili sauce wasn't that impressive. The traditional one would have peanut fragment and really spicy oil as well. The staff were really nice and thoughtful!,10/10 The food is amazing. Daughters got the bbq pork dumplings & sea weed salad. I ordered their lunch special chili dumplings and egg rolls. You will NOT be disappointed.,The food was delicious and I totally recommend this place!!! I had to double up on the wonton with chili because it was soo good! The original XLB was another favorite! Come to this place !!,Best dumplings I've ever had by a long shot i've been coming here for a year now and it never disappoints.,Outstanding in every respect. Delicious dim sum, great prices, friendly environment. Definitely go if you haven't tried it before.,Had wontons in chili oil and another dish.  For sure recommend the wontons in chili oil since the other dish wasn't memorable.,All of the food is very bland, lacks flavor or seasoning. The service is okay but the food is just not doing it.,Goooooood dumplings. Ordered through the Yelp app - the veggie dumplings and the soup were the standouts. Had it as drunk food and normal sober dinner too. Both times were great so it's not just the booze talking.,I've eaten a lot of take out dumplings in the city in the past two years and Dumpling House in the Castro is one of my favorites. The pan fried vegetable and meat bun was very tasty. The shrimp toast, deep fried wontons, barbecue pork buns, and sticky rice meat dumplings were all delicious.,My son loves dumplings  he said he would like to come back to eat here again,THE BEST EVER. The chili wontons are so delicious and definitely a must when you go. One of my favorite little spots in the city.,Sunday 2:00pm - quiet with only a few tables taken.  Easily seats up to 4 ppl. Must try:- black truffle xiaolong bao was out of this world. The flavor coming out of this was actually amazing. This was certainly the standout dish- red chili wonton was no where near as spicy as it looks but certainly good flavor coming from the oils and the filling- pan fried pork vegetable baozi was stellar. crunchy on the outside, warm and delicious on the inside. Cannot recommend:- Crystal shrimp did not have a lot flavor and was rather disappointing compared to the other dishes. - Vegetable dumplings also simply could not compare. Other dishes that were definitely good: bbq pork baozi, scallion pancake. I wouldn't recommend this to a vegetarian person. I don't think the options are great, although I didn't try any of the noodle dishes or veggie stirfry appetizers. I think you can expect to pay ~$20 per person (w/o tax&tip) for a decent amount of food.,Such a small cute spot. I was obsessed with the chili oil dumplings and the wontons, the wrappers are amazing. I have a variety of options and the chili oil dumplings were amazing. Other options were the crab and original XLB, wonton noodle soups, chicken wings, and siu mai. Overall solid experience with a slight wait.,Food is okay, average dim sum and quite expensive for what you get, service is terrible,I dined here for lunch with friends and it was pretty good! The spicy chili wonton was the best we ordered it twice haha XLB and the baked buns weren't as flavorful as I thought but the service was excellent. Overall a pretty good experience!,Great food! Sept service through mobile ordering at your table is easy to use, and convenient! Called before and was seated briefly after arriving. Green beans were great! Got soup dumplings and pork buns.,I don't know where to start but this place was great. We actually came here by pure happenstance, I'm not from San Francisco so I thought that this was another dumpling restaurant with nearly a similar name. So we got to the restaurant at 1630 and it didn't open until 1700 so we waited and walked around the neighborhood and then came back. I can say with absolute certainty that this place without a doubt has been the best dumpling restaurant that I've visited and because of that there won't be any need to look for or try out another one.The customer service blew the competition out of the water by a wide margin. Completely engaging us and giving us recommendations. Everything was great and we will definitely be coming back again.,Daaaaawg!!!! We were visiting this April for cherry blossom festival which I highly recommend to anyone wanting to check new things out. Looked up on yelp where the spot to get dumplings was and this place had a lot of reviews and good stars. We got there right in the nick of time. They did ask about reservations when we walked in, we didn't have any but the place was empty so we got sat thank God.  We started ordering fast because knew it was a matter of time before this bih filled up. I think we got the generals chicken won tons or something like that  WOW THEN we ordered other things that also Wow wow wow       We keptum coming because there was no missing,  sweet pork bun, shrimp, beef      Everyone was insane pleasant. Thank you for this experience.,Recently came for dinner with a friend. Seated promptly and service was friendly. Everything we ordered was tasty and fresh. Glad to see they had their 3rd anniversary and hoping they stay around a long time. Will be back.,"Found this spot while roaming around SF and it was such a great find. The bao's were so soft and warm inside. It wasn't overpowering and perfectly seasoned. The wontons were delicious not spicy at all so don't be afraid to try it.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jamie's Place,"I really like this place - it's a great addition to the Inner Sunset community!Came here on a rainy day because we saw they're dog friendly - I called them to confirm it. When we got here, we were probably one of only two tables in the space at an hour before closing. We figured this is normal...but then they started getting really busy, where every table was occupied. After getting our food, I could see why.The food is American breakfast style. A unique feature is a selection of dim sum dishes (har gao, siu mai, soup dumplings, etc) that they offer. I've never seen a western place do dim sum too, but it does seem like a great option to bring your immigrant parents while you load up on your western breakfast. Win-win!Staff was very friendly and came over with water and attention for the dog. It was great. The food was quite good and very Instagram-friendly. I got a seafood omelet with the most gigantic shrimp - pretty sure they could call these things prawns. The potatoes were nice and crisp and the portions perfect. I was a little ambitious and ordered a soup dumpling to try. They forgot it for a while, but when we asked they got it done right away, which was great! The dumpling tasted good, but probably needed a towel over the lid to capture the extra liquid - the base of the wrap had gotten soggy, so was harder to eat. Despite the small sadness at the dumpling, I'd still give this place 5 stars. Great service and great food does that!,First of all, the food was very good. My friend got Oreo pancakes and I got the Joe's Special Scramble, and both were delicious. My eggs could have been a little bit more seasoned, but nothing that some salt and ketchup couldn't fix. However, getting seated was a hassle. We walked in and were told that it would be a 5-10 minute wait, and we were fine with that, so we were waiting. He told us we could sit at the counter and wait, but there was something on it, so he said he would clean it first. But then we looked over and another party that came in after us was being seated at the counter. He apologised, and we said it was fine, that we would wait for a table. And then this couple came in and was immediately seated at a table even though we had been waiting. The guy in charge saw that one of the waitresses had seated them before us, so he apologized and went other to ask them to give up their seats for us. The couple was really rude about it as if they hadn't seen us standing there waiting the entire time. They were seated pretty soon after us, but the waitress went and took their order before ours even though we were there first and seated first. After she took their order, she went and was doing stuff at the register without even looking in our direction for at least five minutes. Finally she decided to take our order after we tried to flag her down several times. The whole experience was pretty frustrating, but it was also a lot of misunderstandings so I don't think it's entirely the restaurant's fault. I'm honestly more annoyed that the couple was complaining about it and being so rude when they were the ones who ended up getting their food first anyways. The food was so good that it was sort of worth it, hence the four stars. Definitely would not be okay with it happening again, but I wouldn't be opposed to going back and hopefully receiving better service.,For dine in on January 8, 2023I have been spending time at UCSF hospital so having lunch out is a welcome break.  I had thought there would be a wait, but I was seated right away. I guess because it was late for lunch. I knew what I wanted to have which was the crab fried rice, a complete meal in itself. The dish was a good-sized portion adorned with a purple dendrobium orchid, one of my favorite flowers. I saved half for another meal and dug into my hearty meal. I appreciated how the hostess and server did not rush me and allowed me to savor and enjoy my food at my pace. I was reenergized to keep watch over a patient. My patronage of the business was also appreciated. 15% dining in tip is included in the bill. That's fine with me as I've been tipping that much to support businesses during the pandemic for takeout.p.s. I brought back my sister the next day for lunch and had the Ocean Scramble with wheat toast. It was yet another beautiful plate of food. I enjoyed making a sandwich with my scramble. The prawns were gigantic and there were like maybe 4 or 5. The potato medley is a mixture of potatoes like in the Exotic Potato from Terra Chips. The strawberry and one slice of orange were naturally sweet. Once again, I had enough left over for another meal. My sister also enjoyed her order of avocado smoked salmon Benedict. There's still more to explore on the menu. We'll be back.,The joe's scramble is ok but they don't season the beef enough and it ended up tasting kind of bitter from the greens. My wife's spicy pulled pork scramble was the better of the two. The hashbrowns are solid.,Another cute brunch spot that popped up in the inner sunset! Not only do they serve up beautiful brunchy foods they also have dim sum and thai dishes! Talk about a power brunch spot. However if you come on a Sunday you might have to put your name down and wait a bit for a table. We stopped by around 12pm and had to wait around 10 mins for a table for 2. We opted for a savory and sweet dish. The crab fried rice looked absolutely delicious and we were glad we ordered it! Even after our other dishes came out, we kept going back to the fried rice. Would HIGHLY recomend. We thought the idea of matcha French toast would be yum, but the dish seemed to lack that signature matcha flavor. We did appreciate that the dish wasn't too sweet and featured fluffy bread. The side of hash brown was worth it, crispy and crunchy although a tad oily but maybe that's the secret to a perfectly golden brown hash! Will be back for more crab fried rice!,Expansive Menu from Sweet to Savory. Automatic 15% Charge in Addition to Taxes. Kind Staff. Zen Ambiance. Free Parking in Golden Gate Park & Paid Meters in Inner Sunset.,I found this place prior to being in SF and couldn't wait to try it.As I arrived, I thought the place was nice. Wish the service was a bit more friendly.  The lady making the latte seemed so mad. I had no idea why. Also, when my mom asked for a bag to Togo for the leftover foods, she totally ignored us. Rude!Nothing to rave about for the foods. Presentation was outstanding but taste was average.I have tried mascarpone pancakes at other restaurants and usually pretty good. Something very different compared to reg pancakes. Right here, I really liked how it looked but I didn't enjoyed it at all.  It wasn't anything special esp for what they charged.. The pancakes were very thin like crepes but just a bit thicker. In between the layers, it was just egg whites? Such a turn off.  Shiu Mai was ok. Similar to most dim sum places. Har gow was not good. Had this strange taste and the skin didn't even stick together. It came right off when picking it up. Hamburger steak looked so good but the meat was a bit bland and not juicy enough.The best of all that was ordered was prob the crab fried rice. It was flavorful and the small bits of crabs was good. Needed more crabs!!! Rice wasn't smushy. Just right. Prob should have taken out the peas. Latte was ok. Nothing out of the ordinary.  Like a reg cup of latte. Couldn't really taste the oat milk.Don't think I will return unless someone really wanna go...,Ordered the smoked salmon avocado eggs Benedict and the matcha pancakes! Was very excited to try the Asian fusion and it did not disappoint. I loved the light and fluffy texture of the pancakes.We came here very early when searching for a brunch place in SF near our sunrise lookout spot and Jamie's place was very neat and clean but still felt very local and unique.,Came in with a large group on a busy day but they were very accommodating. The menu covers a large range from American brunch to dim sum and Thai food. The food took quite a long time for the people who ordered crab dishes. I didn't see many reviews for the Asian food so I was hesitant to order anything from that part of the menu but I was glad I ordered the pad see ew. It was a bit oilier at the bottom but it was very satisfying. My friend ordered a pad Thai and found that to be a bit too dry for her taste.,The fresh orange juice is the only one right here. fresh toast is nothing like fresh toast. Dim sum are horrible like frozen for thousand years and reheat. The shrimp dumpling sticky together and can not even be delivered out to your place.  The most nasty shrimp dumplings I ever have. Can not believe shrimp dumpling can taste so bad.... Fried crab roll are not fresh either.Utensils are not clean.The whole place smell bad, and don't feel comfortable sitting here. And the charge service fee already on the receipt.Don't know how this place end up 4+ star. Must be fake....,Best brunch in the area and where I try to take people if they want to grab breakfast or brunch in Inner Sunset. Everything I've had here is top notch: pancakes, scramble, hash brown, potatoes.,My friend introduced me to Jamie's Place and it's delicious. I love their presentation of food, and of course the food itself is very tasty. I think the interior tricked me, Jamie's place is very humble and their decorations in my opinion do not reflect the uniqueness of the dish I ordered!It's located near Golden Gate Park within a plaza filled with shops and other places to eat. There's also a cute bookstore nearby that was fun to explore! I think the area for Jamie's place was perfect, especially if you're taking people from out of town. My friend and I spent around half a day shopping in the area. I ordered the eggs Benedict and it looks so pretty. Everything from the fruit to the colorful potatoes made the dish enticing. And it was equally as delicious! My friend ordered the same and she enjoyed it too :)I also ordered a hot chocolate and it was yummy. I can't wait to go to Jamie's Place again and check out their other dishes. I highly recommend Jamie's Place!,I'm not sure why there's a crab in their logo as I didn't see anything on the menu that featured crabmeat. No matter as I like the name since it's the name of a certain loved one of mine. Besides which, there are several similar-minded casual eateries in the 9th Avenue hub between Irving and Judah. I chose this spot because they offer Joe's Special, and frankly I couldn't remember the last time I had it. Back when I had no discernible taste buds, I used to have it at places like Mel's or (gasp) Denny's.Fortunately the $15 Joe's Special Scramble evoked the right adolescent memories as it hit the spot with spinach, mushrooms and a liberal helping of ground beef. It came with a multi-color potato medley (a nice variation on home fries) (photo: bit.ly/3BSlubr) and thin slices of sourdough toast (photo: bit.ly/3dmvHn1). There wasn't anyone else in the restaurant after 1PM, which I hope isn't indicative of the current economic malaise. They deserve a successful run, especially with that name. Then I can say, ""Hey Jamie, meet me at Jamie's.""FOOD - 4 stars...good to see ya, JoeAMBIANCE - 4 stars...pleasantly spacious SERVICE - 4 stars...quite cordial TOTAL - 4 stars...did I miss the crab?RELATED - Exploring the Sunset? Here's a collection of places I've visited and reviewed: bit.ly/2EI8eIJ,After the Hot Chocolate race, we decided to try Jamie's Place for brunch.  We arrived just a few minutes late as other race participants beat us to the restaurant.  We were told it would be about 30 min for a table for 11 people.  We waited closer to an hour.  The brunch here is an interesting mix of a variety of cuisines.  Jamie's offers some dim sum dishes along with regular brunch items such as bacon and eggs.  Because it was a busy morning for them, our order trickled out slowly.  Those who got their plates first ended up eating without waiting for the rest of the orders to come out.  The food was average.  There were a a couple of big misses.  The English muffin in the egg Benedict dish was not toasted so the dish wasn't as good as it could've been.  The hamburger steak and eggs needed salt added to help with the blandness.  Although the experience wasn't horrible and the restaurant has a quaint, cute feel to it, Jamie's is not a place I'll likely return to.,Good food and service in a bright and inviting place. Ordered the vegetarian omelet with mixed potatoes and toast.,Jamie's Place is one of the best Asian Fusion restaurants I've been to. First off I love the menu's variety; they have everything from dim sum to traditional brunch food to sweet items. We decided to get the Matcha Green Tea Pancake, and I love the intricate and unique plating. It came with dragon fruit, edible flowers, berries, and oranges covered in a warm and delicious matcha sauce. The matcha sauce wasn't too sweet or bitter and had the consistency of melted chocolate. There were 3 pancakes, and they were incredibly fluffy while still crispy on the outside.Jamie's Place is a brunch spot that I will be coming to often, and I can't wait to try more dishes from their menu!,Dish:-Crab Benedict with Hash browns-Spicy Pork Benedict Pro:-Hash browns were really crispy and delicious without being too oily-Spicy Pork Benedict was good with more kick to it but not spicy.-Service was great and on top of it-They top off your latte for freeCon:-Not enough hash browns,Tried this place on a Sunday at 11:30 AM and there was surprisingly no wait!The food was amazing! The staff were all very kind and attentive. There's so much that I want to try!I got the crab benedict which had lots of crab in it. The hollandaise sauce was perfectly creamy and yolk was super runny. I really like the potato medley they had which had yams, sweet potatos, and normal potatoes. The hash browns were super crispy too!I also tried the Blueberry Pancakes which came with a really good vanilla curd. They were slightly crispy on the outside and super fluffy on the inside. I would definitely come back again to try the green tea Pancakes.,Looking for a variety between American breakfast and dim sum on the weekend? Jamie's place will have both for you. I came by on a Sunday morning before heading into golden gate park and wow, we were in for a treat. We ordered the omelette, mimosas, and some dim sum: shumai, veggie dumplings, and pork ribs in black bean sauce. I'm a bit of a skeptic when it comes to places that offer very different genre of foods on the same menu, but I thought the dim sum and omelette were both good, which was a win in my book that they were able to be consistent in quality through the variety of dishes.The dim sum menu was very limited, with only about 5-6 choices, but the ones I had were definitely good. I left happy, full, and satisfied. Great spot if you're in the area.,I really enjoyed this place. The spaciousness, the service, and the food. It's a great mix of Asian fusion and we got to bring our dogs inside to eat.Spicy pork jalapeno Benedict was a hit. They have a unique hollandaise sauce that really made this dish super flavorful. The egg was perfectly cooked with enough yolk to create a great food ""pron"" picture.Matcha green tea pancakes were also delicious. There is a green tea sauce on top and the pancakes themselves have a great matcha taste to them. Lots of fruit and cream also made this dish super yummy.The dim sum was also well made. Shumai and XLB were legit.Everyone was super friendly and never had to ask for anything because they refilled and provided dishes before we even asked.Will definitely recommend this place to anyone in the inner sunset area!,This place is a weird fusion of dim sum and American brunch but it works somehow. I had low expectations because of the exterior but the food was great. I came on Sunday around 11AM and there were not too many people. The interior is a good size so it would be good for larger groups. The server came over promptly to take our order. We ordered the california omelet, avocado benedict, and pancakes. The pancakes were surprisingly really good. I'd come back here again.,Go here for the egg Benedict!! The ocean and I checked is absolute heaven I despise having too salty of a dish and often the hollandaise sauce is overwhelmingly salty here it's very light and compliments the seafood there a very large shrimps only Bit of crab but it totally adds to the dish as does the spinach and the wonderful super thinly sliced red onions. Make sure you have a company by the potato medley rather than the hash brown potato medley involves white and purple and sweet potatoes that are banks rather than fried there puffy and delicious. Oh I totally regret not asking what kind of coffee they serve I ordered the regular coffee and it was sir herb absolutely the best I've had since leaving Europe! I cannot wait to return!I really wanted to give this wonderful restaurant five stars but I have a reputation to uphold and if I have friends that went there and saw the nasty dirty menus and the bathroom with the baby porta potty filled and  overflowed all over the floor,  I'll be laughed at.,This was a nice Asian-fusion brunch in the Sunset with a homey family-owned vibe. The plating was pretty and the food was solid. Came on a Sunday morning and there was a short wait walking in. Overall, a solid weekend brunch spot!,Asian fusion is usually a hit or miss because it's hard to perfect American brunch foods or Chinese dim sum on their own, but here's a place that executes both cuisines perfectly! FoodAvocado smoked salmon Benedict: I love smoked salmon Benedicts, and this one didn't disappoint! You can get hash browns or potato medley--go for the medley for a more unique potato side! Not a lot of places offer potato sides other than hash browns or fries, so definitely take advantage. Seems like they air fry their potatoes too. Aesthetically beauuuuutiful, ample amounts of avocado, and the fruit was sweet and added a gorgeous color to the plate. Only downside was that the avocado wasn't quite ripe yet, but I don't blame them because avocados are such finicky fruits! NEW green tea matcha pancake: I am not a fan of matcha because it's bitter and tastes like ground up grass, but my friend loves matcha and I haven't heard of any other place that offers this, so we went full send and tried this. No regrets, even from me. The pancakes are a little smaller than you'd expect from a typical brunch spot like Bill's Cafe, but that's not really a bad thing. Outer ring was crispy and light, inside was dense and packed with flavor despite being thin. Good portions of matcha sauce, matcha powder, and variety of fruits including dragonfruit, blueberries, golden kiwis, and raspberries! Pansy petals and an orchid flower sprinkled with some sprouts on top, making this dish easily the most eye-catching with its colors and mix of flavors. They also have a little tiny dim sum menu:Shiu mai, XLB, pork ribs in black bean sauce, chicken feet in black bean sauce, shrimp dumplings. Shiu mai: one of the best Shiu mai I've ever had. Outer skin wasn't soggy, inside was springy and filled with the delicious shrimp and pork! Comes with the chili paste hot sauce--they know how to serve and eat their dim sum! XLB: not bad, but Din Tai Fung does it better. --Their menu is chock full of so much variety, and I love that they present beautiful food without compromising taste and quality. So happy I found this place, dying to go back and try their other dishes. -- Side note: If you're sensitive to smells, they use a strong chlorine smelling cleaner on their tables and it almost destroyed my nose. Smell went away right when food came though, so i don't think it changed the flavors of my food. Only street parking.,This place is named after the founder's daughter. Quality/Quantity - House Special Fried Rice.Pad See Ew with Chicken.Both dishes were good, but because we just ate so many pastries from 85 Degree Bakery, we were not that hungry. So we had leftovers from both dishes. Look forward to trying your future in-house made dim sum. Atmosphere - Small local business.Street parking, good luck.Love the ""love"" decor, see pictures. Pun intended.Free wifi. Service - Good, the owner is very friendly and visits every table to ensure that the guests are happy. Seemed to really like kids. Sadly, they are so understaffed that they have decided to close today for dinner. Please update your Yelp hours to reflect this and good luck. Price - $31.50 + tip. Owner Comment - Congrats on your success for the last 2 years.,This place is excellent, the decor is very inviting and upscale feeling, the staff are very friendly and helpful, and the food is amazing!The food is not only presented well looking classy and delicious, but it's also very interesting options for many traditional dishes done in the cushion style.,Had brunch with my sister for Mother's Day at Jamie's Place. We were greeted immediately and they were friendly and attentive throughout our visit. This time I ordered Jamie's Combo - 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 bacon, 2 sausage, and ham. Thought it would be too much food, but it was just right. They weren't big pancakes, which I initially thought might've been a good thing to avoid overeating. But, after eating them, I wish they were bigger as they were so good. Kinda crispy on the outside, fluffy inside, and that butter was yummy. Didn't need to use the syrup as they were perfect as they were. Sister ordered the Ocean Benedict and noted that she liked the dish, especially the hollandaise sauce as it had a citrusy taste that livened up the dish. Since it was Mother's Day, they gave us an eclair to share. What a nice way to end our meal.,There is a wait and it's worth it. We came back a total of 2-3 times. The pull pork Benedict is still my favourite. The mascarpone pancake, Oreo pancake and  Jamie's combo are amazing! The price is really good for a party of 4 we spent under $100 bucks which is hard to find now a days.The food presentation are so beautiful.,Summary:Another solid Thai fusion brunch spotDetails:* Enjoy the likes of Kitchen Story / Sweet Maple / Blackwood, but craving more variety? Check out Jamie's!* Food isn't as fantastic as the options in the Choi brunch empire, but is solid overall, with a far more extensive menu* Mascarpone pancakes are nice and fluffy, and STUFFED with mascarpone, not simply mixed in to the flour* Hashed browns and rainbow potatoes are fried well and deliciously crisp* No outdoor seating, but doors and windows are kept open, with seating options near theseAccessibility:Spacious, with a mixture of table options, most (if not all) of which should be accessible.,I swear SF has the best brunch spots! The breakfast foods at Jamie's are absolutely tasty and aesthetically pleasing! Besides eggs Benedict's, pancakes, and omelets, they also offer Thai lunch and dinner entrees. My group of four met up on Saturday at noon for brunch. Street parking was difficult and we had to circle around a couple times before finding a metered spot. -1 star for service. Waited a good thirty mins before a waitress came by to tell us food was on the way and another 15 mins for everything to arrive. By then, I was so ready to dig in!Thai iced tea: good, as expected. Spicy pork eggs Benedict: this was by far my favorite dish! Poached eggs were perfectly runny, spicy pork was sweet and a lil spicy, and hollandaise sauce paired well with everything. Potato medley could have been crispier.Jamie's combo: loved how the pancakes were light/fluffy and came with some fresh fruits. We were able to try their bacon, sausage, ham, and any two style of eggs. Green tea French toast: you really can't go wrong with French toast, butter, and syrup. I could barely taste the green tea flavor. Perhaps the chef only added a hint of green tea into the batter and sprinkled some on top at the end,I came to Jamie's place with two other girlfriends and we had a great brunch experience here. The menu items all looked super cute so it was hard to pick just one thing!I got the ocean scramble with fresh crab meat and shrimp and I loved it. The crab and shrimp was fresh and sweet. We also ordered the green tea french toast to share. I wish the green tea flavor was a little stronger, but it was still good.We sat here for a few hours and just chatted, and the owners of Jamie's were so sweet. Love to support a local business!,This place is really cute and they have great options for brunch and lunch.My friends and so came at 11am on a Saturday. There was surprisingly no wait. Parking here is inconvenient but there is a paid parking lot down the street.We got two Benedict's with hash browns and the mascarpone banana pancakes. The Benedict's were good but we were disappointed by the size of the hash browns. Also the ocean Benedict hardly had any crab it might as well have been a shrimp Benedict. The banana walnut pancakes were so overpriced (the same price as a Benedict) they were pretty flat. I think maybe they were trying to go for a soufflé pancake but it seemed like basically just had layered whipped egg whites between each pancake which was just eggy and unpleasant. There were no walnuts to be seen. And no mascarpone to be tasted. Also maybe it's just me, but I thought it was odd they put sprouts on a pancake. I guess it looks nice but it was strange to be eating a salad with my pancakes.,Friendly service, nice presentation of plates, food was ok (not bad, not great).   Would I go back?  Hmmm....Food 3 stars (average) plus .5 star for the service and presentation, overall 3.5 stars generously rounding to 4.,I came to Jamie's Place with high hopes due to the high star and high review but left disappointed.Overall, the savory dishes were underwhelming. The Ocean scramble was mostly shrimp with eggs although the menu said it would have crab and other seafood, and it lacked flavor. My friend's California omelet was also under seasoned, and the chicken sausage was more like ground meat to our surprise. There were small portions in the omelet, so it lacked the expected chicken sausage flavor. Our toasts came very late for some reason.. and they were small slices :( At least the green tea French toast was kind of good, but it wasn't anything spectacular. The matcha flavor was subtle, the toasts weren't evenly cooked (one more soggy than the other two which were barely coated with the egg batter).,This is the best breakfast spot I've ever been to in SF !!! Amazing service too, chef brought out our meals very respectfully, the atmosphere here is old school and clean, very City oriented at the same time,Absolutely delicious and really gorgeous plating for the great prices, Super clean and the ambiance was nice overall will go back soon,We came here on a Sunday and it was packed. We waited around 15 min until we got seated. I found this place on Yelp so I figured it was worth the wait since it has high reviews. Although the service was slow and the bathroom was very dirty with the floors wet, the food was amazing. The eggs Benedict dishes and pancakes were wonderful. And the presentation was great. Solid 4 stars.,On a little gloomy day in the city, I ordered delivery through Grubhub (the actual app not through Yelp, which I recommend). We ordered the avocado eggs Benedict and Oreo Pancakes. Avocado Eggs Benedict: one of the eggs was closer to soft boiled, which I'm not complaining about. The avocados were of peak condition, tasting exactly what an avocado should taste like, at the perfect texture. The tomatoes, they indeed were tomatoes. The hollandaise sauce was nothing to write home about but for take-out they provided more than enough sauce on the side. Oreo Pancake: at first glance, we thought it was called Oreo Pancake because there were crushed Oreos on top, but no! There were Oreos crushed inside the pancakes and it tasted like a pancake with crushed oreos, nothing spectacular but exactly what was advertised.,I don't remember if I left a review here before.  But if I did, I'd like to emphasize the love I have for Jamie's place.Even with a line out the door, the quality of  food came out as if it was being prepared only for me.Starting with the fresh squeezed orange to the very last bite. It was all SO DELICIOUS!,The food here is quite tasty. We ordered from their brunch menu including their matcha pancake. The reason for the 4 stars is the billing. There's a clear sign (when we visited) on the door for a mandatory 20% service charge but when we got the bill there was still a line for tipping. I tipped on top of the service charge but in retrospect I think it should at least be marked as optional since the service charge is mandatory. Not sure what everyone's doing with these new restaurant practices!,Lowkey breakfast/brunch spot in Inner Sunset. Had the California omelet (which was very fluffy and amazingly cooked) as well as the ocean scramble which was also delicious. Great quality of food without the long wait time - we were seated right away at noon on a Saturday. Customer service here is also top notch, they're very kind. Will be back again! Also, the dim sum is quite good and was a pleasant surprise.,I brought my cousins to Jamie's and ordered the veggie tofu omelet and presentation is on point as always. I love the shape and glisten of the omelette and appreciate that even the potatoes come in various colors. I think the egg could be a little saltier but that's my preference. Overall, I would order again.,Second time coming here and the food was so delicious. I came on a Tuesday and the service was very quick. The presentation was so cute, I loved the details. If you come here you should try the Mascarpone Pancake and the Pineapple Rice. I'll definitely be coming back again to try some of their other items. It's so hard to choose,I came here with a friend on a Sunday afternoon around 11:30am and there was no wait time. The service here was great and food was very aesthetically pleasing but the food was okay. My friend and I got a Green Tea French Toast and the Crab Benedict to share. I'm not sure if it's because the weather was super cold but the food came warm, almost room temperature. Hence, the food was just okay to me. It wasn't anything special but it wasn't bad either. I would imagine if it came out hot, that it would have tasted a lot better. The service here was great though. The waiter constantly refilled our waters, didn't rush us to finish and get out. And was super kind and allowed us to use the bathroom after we left.,We came here July 4th early morning. They were not very busy so we got seated quickly. Glad they are open on a holiday. Nice food presentation. The taste is meeting expectation but nothing extraordinary. I probably won't be back again as there are so many good brunch options. Check out my other reviews for some brunch recommendations.,My partner and I landed in San Francisco late one afternoon and we were SO hungry. We took BART and MUNI to our Airbnb, discovering that Jamie's Place was along the way. We hopped off the N train and stumbled into the empty restaurant with our luggage and tired bodies. Just the smell of Thai food was enough to wake us up as we drooled over the menu.I got the Pad Kee Mao (my favorite Thai dish) and it was ready so quickly! Honestly one of the best iterations I've ever tasted... So hot and fresh. The noodles were super soft, and the proportion of veggies was perfect. Everything was flavored wonderfully. I know Jamie's Place is marketed as brunch but honestly get their Thai food. It was just what we needed.,November 6th 2021 10:30am I came here on a Saturday morning and it wasn't too busy. There was plenty of seating and about 2 other parties there besides us. We were seated promptly and given a paper menu.I got the Ocean Benedict and it looked appetizing but just a tad bit on the smaller portion size. I wish there was either more fruit or the hash brown was bigger. The ketchup is in these vintage glass bottles which I can understand for the aesthetic but it was extremely difficult to get any ketchup out even after slapping the bottle on the bottom so many times. The food itself was okay. The description of the Ocean Benedict included crab meat but I didn't taste or find any crab meat in my Benedict or maybe it was too subtle. There were some shells in my Benedict I also bit into and hurt my teeth on. The hash hashbrowns were crispy just like I requested them. Overall food was about 3.5 stars.Service was attentive since the waitress checked on us about 4 times. It was a little excessive but at least they did care about how we were and we a",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so got refills on our water.,I am obsessed with this mom and pop style restaurant.Jamie's place is set in the Inner Sunset of San Francisco. My friends and I made our way to this establishment along with a friend that was visiting from SoCal. We wanted to help a family restaurant but that also had brunch options as well as other type of Asian food on the list. Here comes Jamie's Place. They had a fantastic selection of breakfast (eggs, potatoes, and such) as well as brunch (omelets and benedicts) for the savory folks. There's also Thai pan fried noodles, if brunch isn't what you seek.The friend that recommended this place noted that some of the restaurant was popular for their Mascarpone Pancakes ($16) and Green Tea French Toast ($13), both of which were ordered by the friend that connected us. I ordered a Smoked Salmon Benedict ($18) and a Thai Iced Tea ($4), which was very tasty, but which I didn't finish because I wasn't the most hungry. I would argue that they have a great selection of items, but none which seemed to stray from the tried-and-true items.They deliver the plates in perfectly instagram-worthy style and just the right portion of food where you're not bloated and in need of a nap (although, additional rest is always encouraged and important).The staff was very delightful and despite the language barrier, was able to help address all questions and made sure that our coffee and water was replenished. They did, accidentally charge an extra item on our menu, but when we discovered it, they gave us cash for the difference, so not to mess up the electronic bill that was already generated.The restaurant is a good sized, but with limited seating for large parties. Would advise reserving a spot if you have more than 4 and are coming at a peak time.Also, it looks like they have a fantastic lunch and dinner menu as well. Must come back.,Omg the food here is literally amazing. Such a good brunch. Presentation is amazing. Service is so good, they gave my dog two free sausages. They were so friendly, kept checking on on us. Very fast service. Would definitely it let come again for brunch and recommend it. The salmon Benedict was divine. The mascarpone pancake was to die for. So so so delicious. Slightly pricey but worth it. Highly recommend. Wish they had an outdoor dining set up though.,I was surprised to find the large selection of food when we went to Jamie's place for lunch. They have different typical breakfast options and asian-fusion food which was great for our party so we could get a variety! The servers were super attentive and made sure we got what we wanted. It's located in a cute little strip in sunset, so it was fun to roam around after we ate.,Attempted to try this place multiple times, the first time I went got there before the store opened and waited and waited and waited, no sign of it being opened so I left super disappointed. I called back later in the afternoon to see if it was opened and sure enough, someone picked up the phone and I asked for store hours the guy said 8:30am so I told him no, I was there at 8:30 and waited for a while but it wasn't opened. He then explained that he got stuck in traffic.. . Forgot to mention the first time, someone walked by waiting for it to open too but we both did end up leaving thinking it was not gonna open for the day. Second attempted. This time, I called a day in advance to make sure they were gonna open. I got there at 8:30... same shit happened. This time as I was waiting another couple was there too and we started to talk about whether or not this place is gonna open. Turns out this wasn't their first try either! It seems like this happens way too often to be traffic. Come on, if you can't make it there by 8:30 to open then move your hour to 9am!! Very poor business acumen. Other wise the food looked beautiful but tasted only ok. I probably won't be back..,Took my dad here to eat for Father's Day since he was craving eggs Benedict. The presentation of the food was absolutely gorgeous! It was color, playful, and very pleasing to the eye. The crab Benedict had just the right amount of savoriness paired with the creaminess of the avocado and hollandaise sauce. The hash brown could be a little fluffier, since it was pretty flat and crunchy. The green tea French toast could use a little more matcha flavoring in my option, but it's still good!,My boyfriend and I always enjoy a nice brunch spot, so we were excited to try Jamie's Place since they offer lots of dishes that sound AND look really good.We arrived around 1PM on a Saturday and was second in line - waited about 30 min to be seated...then another 30 min to get our food after ordering. Food comes out pretty slow in general since I heard a lot of other tables complain about it too.Anyways, I got the Italian Sausage Omelet but since it has bell peppers aka my arch nemesis, I asked the waitress if  it can be made without peppers and add cheese instead - she said no problem.30 min later I got my food and noticed that there was no cheese, but LOTS of bell peppers in the omelet... * insert dramatic eye roll * so I told the waitress and she apologized and told the kitchen to remake the food. When the new omelet came, they made it with the correct ingredients, however I noticed that the Italian sausage chunks were huge! I bit into it and it was RAW in the middle... lots of pieces also had some tough casings that weren't taken away so it was very chewy. A gentleman came out (maybe the head chef/owner) to take a look at the food and apologized and said he's still trying to train his team. He wanted to remake it again but I didn't want to wait any longer so I ended up eating the first one they made and just picked out the bell peppers. The staff members were super nice but lots of kinks still need to be worked out. For instance the waitress called our name when a table was open but when we walked in, another couple said they were waiting longer than us so she proceeded to seat them first which was fine," but apparently she messed up again and another group was supposed ahead of them.... So that left us just looking at each other going """".....bish what?""""Also my boyfriend ordered the Spicy Pork Benedict", but one of the poached eggs was way too cooked and not runny at all. They ended up taking $10 off the bill, but I don't think I'll be coming back. There are lots of other spots that are better in SF.,Shared two things. We got the marscopone pancakes and crab Benedict. A perfect pair. No wait time. People were really friendly.  If you have a chance try it out.  They also have more than just 3 flavors of tea which was lovely.,I had high expectations for this place based on the pictures and high star but it was just alright. I think the presentation of the food was really cute, but the taste was okay. My fiancée said it was comparable to ihop. The prices were also pretty high for the food received. Would I come back? Probably not!,Came here on a Sat. to give this place a try. The wait time for 4 is about 20-30 mins. After we ordered our food and it took another 20-30 mins for part of orders to show up and the rest...just had to wait! The Ocean Benedict was light and fresh. We like the potato totes better than hash browns! I mainly wanna try their crab meat fried rice. It took really long time to come and it was just ok.,The food was very good. Especially the hash browns. Very crispy. It was surprising that they let our dog inside the restaurant. So, it was good for him. Maybe because he was a very small dog. The service was also excellent and we got seated right away. So, no waiting.,Quiet place tucked in along 9th right next to Golden Gate park! I came in on a Wednesday morning around 9am and was seated immediately. Food is nothing surprising but delicious and aesthetically pleasing! The Green Tea French Toast was yummy, but didn't really taste too much like Green Tea. The Chorizo Benedict was definitely on point and I was happy with the generous side order of potatoes. The prices are very affordable, especially for the area.Service is very sweet and attentive. I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a good brunch spot in Sunset!,Sometimes I want a relaxed brunch experience and that's why I come to Jamie's. It's never too busy. I never feel forgotten. And they take good care of you. I've had the Ocean Benedict and the Spicy Pulled Pork Scramble. Both were good. I was pleasantly surprised by the spicy pulled pork because it was savory, sweet, and perfect amount of kick. I love pepper jack cheese and that was melted throughout the scramble. I'm def ordering that again. I liked the blueberry pancakes too. I think you get like 2 pancakes? But the blue berry and vanilla curd married so well. And it's not overwhelming sweet.Plating is one of their strengths here. My food always come out looking like a work of art. If you're looking for a low-key brunch place, this is one of them.,Food: 3.5/5- Jamie's combo: pancakes were super fluffy and crispy on the top. Sausages weren't that good and bacon was a little dry- California omelette: their omelettes are basically a giant fluffy egg blanket placed over the ingredients cooked separately, but it was still good and very filling! The hash browns were a little greasy though. Service: 5/5 super friendly and checked in on us to make sure we found everything okay! They also ask for proof of vaccination for everyone who enters, which makes it feel safer,Menu didn't match Yelp menu. Went there at 12:30 pm and 75% of menu was breakfast items. Tried to order two non-breakfast items that were on the menu. Friendly waitress stated they weren't serving that today! Later, a man came to our table and apologized for not having all the items they offer on the menu. He said they're in transition to serving items for dinner and they want to make sure the ingredients they use are fresh and they ran out of the ingredients the prior night.,I went here on a Friday morning. Workers were very friendly & we were seated right away. I loved the salmon Benedict! The food is good for sharing!! Presentation is very aesthetically pleasing!,Lovely cafe with hearty traditional American breakfasts and lunch. They also have some delightful Asian-fusion dishes such as Spicy Benedict. Our group enjoyed an excellent breakfast. The service was equally excellent. I can't wait to go back in the evening to try their dim sum and fusion meals for dinner. The menu looks great!,Second time we ate here. Not crowded for Tuesday. Very good service and very good entree presentation. Diner size and very clean looking. Strawberry French Toast excellent. Tex Mex scramble with hash brown and toast. A little tough parking, meter street parking only.,This is a only a review on the dim sum. I have tried the usual dim sim take out places in the Sunset and Richmond but this one is by far the best with the more sophisticated ingredients. I tried the spareribs, shumai and chicken claw. Was it slightly more expensive?  Yes but totally worth it!  The downside is these are the only three items I saw on the menu.  One star down for the chicken claw 鳳爪 it didn't have the usual softness and the sauce was a tad too sweet.,Wondered on Yelp to check others reviews for a new breakfast spot since I normally cook my own breakfast but why not treat myself for a breakfast after Christmas Day. Needed something different and Jamie is the place for a good new breakfast experience. First I tried the crab fried rice. So divine and yummy. I was experiencing an extended Christmas gift. The California omelette so soft and tasty with avocado on top. The 3 cheese omelette was so fluffy and had bacon inside . The potatoes were soft and not soggy. Yelpers are Santa Helpers.,Appreciated how attentive the servers were - halfway through the meal, she brought over new plates and utensils and checked in often to ask how the food was. The food was DELICIOUS and very aesthetically pleasing. My friend and I ordered a Spicy Pork Benedict and a Green Tea French Toast! Will definitely come again!,Really solid brunch spot in SF !! - Pulled Pork Scramble w/ Hashbrowns and English MuffinI'm a sucker for savory dishes and this one hit the spot. The cheese was melted in with the eggs and the pulled pork was not too salty. The hashbrowns were a little on the oily side, but I don't mind especially since I know they're fried crispyy. I love all forms of potatoes, but these ones were your generic hashbrowns--still good, but nothing unique(I do wish they gave a little bit more though). Overall, a classic brunch dish with a little something different with the pulled pork. - French ToastMy friend got the French toast and the brioche bread they used for the dish was really what stood out to me the most. It was soft and fluffy, but still had a good crunch to it. It wasn't too sweet and I would definitely recommend this one to any french toast fanatics out there. I kind of liked it better than the scramble.. lolOverall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area! The servers were so sweet, the dishes were reasonably priced(for SF) and the plating was v aesthetic, and looked beautiful. I wasn't wowed, but still a great choice for a good brunch on a Sunday afternoon.,"Went here with a party of 6 and I really enjoyed it. They have a super unique and diverse menu that seemed a little odd on paper. We tried most of their breakfast items and it was amazing! It's a cute little place and not something that immediately catches the eye. The food is amazing here and there's not one single thing I can point a complaint to.We tried a lot of their dishes but the most notable things to me were their eggs and their potatoes. The egg was perfectly runny and made for a great dipping """"sauce"""" for the potatoes. The potatoes were very crispy and absolutely delicious ( I even had to order a separate side ).The service is also great. I give massive props to the hostess / server. She served the entire restaurant by herself and never did she miss anything. She was in a very hectic state ( understandably ) but was super nice and very attentive. When we had an overcooked egg", she ran back in, got in fixed and brought it back out in a very timely manner. The other things I tried were the bacon ( had a nice crunch and salt / oil content ). Scrambled eggs were fluffy. The green tea french toast was a little bit too sweet for my taste but it's definitely goes well with one of the savory dishes. The pancakes were rich and fluffy as well. Loved my experience here. To top it all off, a meal for 7 was $107. Really good price ( $15 per person ) for the amount of food we got.Loved my experience here and something I would definitely recommend.,We had lunch here and loved everything about this place (including my foodie husband and picky toddlers). Staff were super friendly and accommodating, place looks lovely and clean. Food and drinks were absolutely delicious and they had plenty of options for everyone (American breakfast, Asian inspired). We had Jamie's combo, blueberry pancakes, salmon Benedict, yellow curry, crab cake bites and drinks. Many thanks for your lovely food and service. We will definitely come back next time we're in the city.PS: We loved the food presentation. I truly appreciate and admire little presentation touches. It makes a diffeeence too,My second time coming here and this is a great brunch spot! The first time I came here was on a Sunday brunch and we didn't have to wait too long for our seats! The food was so delicious, the staff was so sweet! Today (Thursday) we went more around 1, so there was only one other table. The food, again, was delicious! And the owners are so so sweet! Even the other table was leaving with an abundant of compliments to them! I definitely will continue to come here! It is a but pricey, but worth it (: food and presentation on point!,My friend found this place on Yelp & we decided to stop by for brunch today on a Sun afternoon. Got there a little after 12pm & there was no wait. Spacious spot! Vaccination cards were required. Workers were friendly & kept checking in on us during our meal.I tried the smoked salmon benedict w/ hash brown (you have the option of potato medley too). I have to admit, the pink hollandaise sauce caught my eye in the picture & made me want to get it. Gotta add tabasco to my plate (love some added flavor/kick) - everything tasted good.My friend tried the spicy pulled pork scramble w/ hash brown. She also enjoyed it! We both cleared our plates, so that must mean something. Definitely satisfied our hunger!Another good brunch spot in the city added to the books.,First time here and it was pretty good. I had the California omelet , angel wings and steak and eggs. Sticking to low carb meals lol. The steak n eggs isn't anything special you can't find anywhere else. The Cali omelete and angel wings are really good. Just heads up the wings would go great with rice. The place is more of a Asian American fusion restaurant. At the moment no dinner yet which I can't wait when they do to see what they will be serving. The decor is ok. A bit of old school style but hey as long the food is good is what matters. Oh, I love the plates too. So pretty. Also don't forget their yummy fresh squeezed OJ must get. Overall we really enjoyed ourselves. The service is great  like any good mom and pop store. I Definitely recommend and will be back to this place.,Jamie's has become one of our favorite brunch places.  They just added the matcha green tea pancakes on the menu and they were delicious.  The flavor wasn't over powering and of course the sauce was perfect. The coffee is really good along with excellent service.   Highly recommend you try this place.,I was so excited to try this brunch place out but left with a disappointment... I was seated as soon as I walked in and the lady took my order shortly after. However... after I got my coffee and white toast, I waited for another 45 minutes just to get my food... I don't know why but the other parties that got seated after me got their food before my table did. I was a little annoyed so I asked the server if my food would be coming out too... it seems like they forgot my tables order and moved on to other people. So if I did not mentioned it to the server to remind them it would have been another hour for me to get my food.... My experience here was not what I expected :(,Cute little restaurant, Breakfast was so good!  I had Jamie's combo plate and my friend had the strawberry French toast. We also ordered shrimp dumpling they were AMAZING. We left so full. Try this place out, great food and great service.,Food was good. Prices were reasonable for the food you would get. It was empty on a weekday afternoon. We almost had the whole place to ourselves, which was nice during this time of the pandemic. Food was nicely presented and tasted as good as it looked. I love my hashbrowns this way. The mascarpone pancakes were the star. So fluffy and soft and delicious, especially with the caramelized bananas. I'd get that again!,Yum! What an amazing breakfast place! I have passed by it a million times and now I regret I waiting so long to try this yummy breakfast place!,Came on a Saturday morning at 10am and was seated right away. People started to trickle in after we have arrived and the place quickly filled up at around 10:45am. Despite this cute quaint breakfast shop, the food did not live up to expectations. The presentation of the dishes were very nice, but the taste was disappointing. I ordered the California omelette and the egg was bland and spongey. It came with chicken apple sausages, green onions, garlic, tomatoes, avocado, and cheddar cheese. I asked for no tomatoes, but when the dish came...it had so many green onions I couldn't taste anything else. The dish comes with either hash browns or potato medley and toast. Despite opening at 8am, they were out of potato medley...at 10am. The hash brown was also super oily. The dishes were also not served together and my boyfriend's dish didn't come until my food was cold. He ordered the avocado smoked salmon Benedict and it was also not that warm. His hash browns were also really oily. Servers also didn't refill our water until we asked for the check and were ready to leave. They checked in quite a bit, and it was honestly excessive. Honestly did not enjoy my experience. The food really was underwhelming and I am not coming back. It was also fairly expensive (typical for brunch though).,Delicious Thai brunch spot!! Super sweet owners :) tried the avocado salmon Benedict, pad Thai, and banana mascarpone pancakes. Everything was wonderful, especially the pancakes!!!,I'm full and happy, eat here at Jamie's place.  Eggs were perfect, the pancakes had a great texture (crispy edges soft inside) and the potato medley was as colorful as it was tasty.  I also loved the veggie egg rolls.  The staff, two people working the front of the house alone, were very nice.Food was also presented with care and looked pretty.Love the idea of ordering breakfast, lunch and/or Asian dishes.  We mixed it up and everyone got what they wanted.Prices were reasonable.I'll be back.,I came back a year later and ordered the same Ocean omelet visiting. This time eggs were soggy. Shrimp was undercooked, too translucent and made me noxious. Very disappointed. Took forever getting order. I gave them 3 stars as they are a small family owned diner and service was decent despite the long wait on food. hopeful they'll do better next time.,Not a big fan of the food," but what really upset me about were all the """"fees"""" Was charged 2$ for a jalapeño in my omelet and 15% for dining in.",I visited on a weekend morning and thoroughly enjoyed the Joe's Scramble and a cup of coffee. The service was pleasant and timely. The scramble came with 2 strawberries, a slice of orange, a flower and hash browns. It was presented quite aesthetically. The scramble was a good size serving and the hash browns were absolutely perfect and tasty. I've been searching for the best hash browns in the City for awhile and feel that I've finally found it at Jamie's Place!,Jamie's place is the place where you want to come back again and again! the place where you can have breakfast, lunch, dinner and never gets disappointed! Prices are reasonable but food is so tasty, there is a huge variety of breakfast, forget about ordinary omlet, get Joes  special scramble oh my good nothing tastier I have never tried or spicy pulled pork scramble ! you can also order online and get delivery! will definitely come back many times! all the best!,Came by with my family and had a great time. The food was amazing! Especially the pancakes? They were light yet crispy. I got the strawberry french toast with marscapone. The plating was beautiful. The owners were super nice too! Will definitely come again!,Very cute family owned place with delicious breakfast options. The crab Benedict and hashbrowns and eggs are amazing. Very clean environment and courteous staff as well.,Cute little breakfast joint near UCSF. They have a wide choice of Benedict's as well as other yummy items. Hollandaise sauce was outstanding. Hash browns were crunchy but light, top that off with fresh squeezedOJ... The best breakfast I've had in a while. Well done Jamie's p. I'll be back.,Jamie's place is one of those Instagram-able brunch places that you expect super long lines for. Thankfully today, on a Friday at 1pm, there was no wait at all! The outside doesn't really match the type of food and gorgeous presentation they have, so I was hesitant to walk in cause I thought I might have walked into the wrong place.I arrived early and asked if they do anything for birthdays and they said they usually can do a dessert if they're made aware at least a day in advance but they still ended up bringing out a short cake (small pancakes) with such a gorgeous presentation for my friend. So nice!!The service was so friendly and attentive. It's pretty spacious inside. The portions are good sizing. My friend ordered the Denver omelet and it was filled with so much ham, she left some out because of the generous portions. I ordered the spicy pulled pork benedict with hash browns and it was delicious and unique. It came with a jalapeno hollandaise sauce and wasn't very spicy at all - more on the mild side. The shortcakes was free and it tasted yummy too! Presentation is so on point. I'm so happy with everything that I normally don't write reviews right away, but I wanted to make sure not to forget to write this review. Will definitely be back way more often!,Amazing food and MANY vegan options. and  great appetizers and desserts. Food quality is outstanding. The huge serving amount that you get the flavors and the absolutely perfect service will have you smiling ear to ear.Garlic broccoli style was very good! I finished it all. The owner is so kind and sweet. Nice service and great hospitality.Highly recommend.,Went for breakfast.  Great service.  Large portions.  Hash browns are crispy.  I had avocado Benedict.  Hollandaise was good and not too salty. Hubby had ham breakfast.  Everything had flavor.  Side note. I'm in a mobility scooter and this restaurant is handicapped friendly.  However I did not see the restroom.,My new go to place for bunch. Decent coffee, good service and amazing food. My favor is the California omelette with puffy egg and best pancake in town. My friend also recommends the soup, I didn't get the name but he loves the south east Asia favor! I will try it next time.,Came here the other day with one of my best friends after we got hooked on seeing the photos from their Yelp! Food 3.5- We got 2 different items to try. The first dish was the smoked salmon Benedict but it was really cold ): we know that it's smoked salmon so it's not supposed to be hot but the whole Benedict was cold, the pink sauce on top was really good so that made up for it! The second dish was the green tea French toast. This was pretty decent except it didn't have a strong green tea taste to it. Instead of powder sugar dusting on top I would opt for matcha powder!Decor and interior 1.5- hmm for the great and beautiful presentation of the food I was expecting a beautiful and aesthetically pleasing interior but it's really cookie cutter inside and the decorations were mehService 5!! Their service was amazing! They have a lot of servers and they were all prompt and super attentive. I really have no complains as to how well they treated us  Overall, I would only revisit if I'm in the area and am craving brunch but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back.,The food is delicious, the presentations lovely (including orchid flowers) and the service excellent. It would already be a go-to place anytime in the area and looking for brunch. But making it even more compelling, when we stopped in on my wife's birthday and mentioned so, the chef made a special plate of pancakes for her, decorated with flowers and fruit (see photo). it was lovely and a wonderful way to start the day's celebration. We later went to an expensive restaurant for dinner, and their recognition (a little happy birthday sign on the dessert we ordered) paled in comparison to the lovely pancake recognition from this place. We went back since, and it was delicious again. The only nit-pick I could make was that the eggs under the hollandaise could have been warmer, but I was happy that when I mentioned that when departing, I really felt like the feedback was appreciated and would be acted on in the future -- a great attitude. Oh, and the coffee is so good it is even better black and straight -- unusual for me.,Been here couple times for breakfast and this place doesn't miss! The garden scramble is an absolute favourite of mine! I'm not an asparagus fan but the way it's prepared in this scramble makes it taste so good! I've been here on the weekend and weekday and the stuff is always accommodating with getting you seated quick! Definitely a place I will return to time and time again!,Everything was pretty and good. really liked the potato medley. the Avocado smoothie was thick and creamy and should have a bigger straw lol but thats the only complaint.,This place was a great surprise! I just found it on Yelp and decided to check it out and I can confidently say that I had a great experience. The staff were all so nice and the owner even talked to us about adding new menu items soon. The food and drinks both look beautiful and taste great! HIGHLY recommend the potato medley, all their potatoes are thoroughly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside - perfect! Friend was raving about the crab benedict. We will definitely be back!,I'm writing this review as I finish my breakfast here right now lol. I'm the first customer of the day and our server I think is the owner, her little girl, Jamie, sits in the corner table near the kitchen okays with her toys quietly. This is such a warm place, she was very attentive with us even when more customers poured in as breakfast turned to brunch. We ordered the ocean scramble and French toast... we definitely enjoyed both dishes, especially when you add hot sauce to the ocean scramble. Definitely a good place for family to gather, get all the kids together and enjoy some home cook meals!,Really good Dim Sum.Good Mongolian beef.Good salmon Benedict. I recommend getting the hollandaise sauce on the side,Absolutely delicious. Hidden gem. Everything is delicious. Coffee. Eggs," sides. I'll frequent this place more often. Good job Jamie's place""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sotto Mare,"A Must try when in SF! The ambience of this place really makes me feel like I'm at home with my grandma's cooking and it just feels so much like the family in there. The service from the waiters to the servers everybody work together to really run this establishment. These are the type of things that make a restaurant really stay open and last forever is a staff that works together and helps each other. The food was so amazing. I tried a crab with fettuccine Alfredo pasta and never in my life have I thought of mixing the two together but it was out of this world.The flavor in the crab for the fettuccine was so delicious.The dressing that they used for the salad which might've saved they definitely do not skimp you on the seafood, so good!  The shrimp cocktail had super big prawns and was very fresh. Let's not forget the clam chowder! It has bacon in it,Sotto Mare is such a great restaurant. Staff is incredible friendly and the restaurant is so cozy! If you're wanting to try a delicious bowl of traditional cioppino in San Francisco this is going to be the place to do it. Fish is always fresh and the cioppino base is a great consistency, it's not too thin or thick. I've been to some restaurants that skimp on the seafood but you'll be impressed with this bowl. Everything else on the menu is also incredible! Favorites:Sea Scallop SauteRisotto with seafood andLinguine with Seafood (white cream sauce)If it's your first time here I highly recommend sharing the cioppino for a party of 2 and don't be shy with their bread. Delicious fresh bread served on the side.,Went here Thursday night with a friend. It was surprisingly busy for a weekday, we waited for about 20mins to be seated. The restaurant is quite small inside, it's long & narrow, reminds me of walking down an airplane aisle on a full flight. But they do have outdoor seating as well along the sidewalk in front of the restaurant. The decor is cute and festive since they specialize in SEAfood. The ambiance will remind you of being in a busy bar if you're seated at the counter. It's pretty casual, definitely not fancy dinner vibes, but definitely pricey. But everyone behind the counter was lovely & the service was good!Now let's dive in about the food! We ordered:1.) The Sea Scallops - they were PERFECTLY Cooked, and the flavor was absolutely delicious. I was looking forward to this menu item the most as I had been craving good scallops for a hot minute! They did not disappoint. My only complaint is that for nearly $30 you only get 5 of those yummy juicy suckers & some mediocre veggies on the side. But I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't order them again, because I definitely would lol . I rate them 4 stars.2.) Raw oysters on the half shell (4 east coast/6 west coast) - we ordered 10. These bad boys were definitely fresh, they were a good size in proportion to the shell, and they tasted pretty decent. Now typically I like my oysters with lemon, that vinegar sauce, & some hot sauce - but here they only come with cocktail sauce & lemon. Pricing was pretty standard on these for dinner time. Probably wouldn't order these again, I like to try oysters at different spots to compare, nothing personal. I rate them 4 stars.3.) The ""Best Damn Cioppino"" - Okay here we go. My friend thought it was great, but I'm gonna have to disagree. It was somewhat decent at best. The seafood in it was fresh & definitely tasted good. But to me the sauce was bland so I was disappointed. & The worst part was they put hella penne noodles in it and I HATE penne  lol. So long story short for $50 I ended up picking all the seafood out and eating that, and I was left with a big bowl of bunch of penne noodles floating in marinara sauce essentially. I took it home and gave it to my roommate. Definitely not worth the money & definitely wouldn't order again. I rate it 2.5 stars.4.) The Pinot Grigio - Okay I'm normally a red wine girl, but considering it was seafood night, my friend recommended the Pinot. To my surprise it was good! Definitely recommend, it paired well. My friend got beer & seemed to enjoy that very much. I give it 4 stars.In conclusion, it definitely wasn't worth $$$ we spent. BUT I'm still gonna give it 4 stars because it wasn't necessarily a bad experience, I would come back, it just wasn't worth the hype. I feel like if I go again and order something else like maybe the seafood risotto or pesto or alfredo based pasta & a fish plate it would be a better choice than the cioppino. But to be fair, I've only tried Cioppino like twice before this, and they all taste very similar to me. Mind you, one of the times it was premade frozen Cioppino from the store. So I had higher expectations for how hyped up the Cioppino was here, but it definitely wasn't the best I've had. I guess in general I probably just won't order that dish lol. But I'd say give the restaurant a chance, they have lots to choose from & it smells so good in there so my guess is other menu items are probably as yummy as those scallops!We were super hungry & forgot to take pics :( sorry yall,The best damn cioppino it is! like they said.We had to wait about an hour and it was worth it. It had perfect umani, not salty not blend, just perfect flavor. Clam chowder was perfect too. I was here 5 years ago when I visited San Francisco and I am glad I came back and that they survived pandemic.,Was recommended this place by a coworker n it was so good. Huge portions, and a good sauce to pasta ratio in my opinion. The clam chowder is thick, which I like and full of good stuff. The seafood risotto was something I would definitely get again, and I barely made a dent before I was so full. Lobster ravioli wasn't my favorite but still good. The waitress here recommended her own personal order to my uncle and he loved it! seems like you can make your own pasta here if you're nice enough lol. Would definitely come back!,This place is amazing!! I think it's one of the best Italian seafood  spots in the city. There's always a lot of people but I promise it's worth the wait. It's such a homey and warm restaurant. Everyone is super friendly and welcoming.Every time I'm here I want to order everything and I usually over order. The cioppino and seafood fettuccine are to die for. I think these two items are a must order if you come here. The fresh oysters and scallops are hella good too. The seafood is so fresh and sweet here. Make sure to ask them for bread because you will need them for the sauce. I love this place and I'm sure you will as well. I'm already thinking of when I'll go again.,Get the ciopinno. Just do it. Don't second guess. If you come here, you just have to get it. What we got:1. The ciopinno: honestly fantastic value for money. This hit the spot perfectly on a rainy day. Generous on the seafood and saucy and perfect for dipping bread in. Great stuff. The free bread wasn't the best, but it's not like they're known for it. 2. Lobster ravioli: cheesy and meaty on the inside. Very rich. Decadent. Good, but might be a bit too much if you have it on its own by yourself. 3. Crab cocktail salad: fresh. Good acid and balance on the cocktail sauce. Not much to tell.,This was our first time going here after our SF native friend recommended it. If the SF native is recommending it despite how scarce parking is- you know it's going to be good. Parking is street parking only and it is a little scarce so be sure to budget time for that. We ended up finding parking a couple blocks over. We came at 5:30pm on MLK day and were sat outside immediately, even though the restaurant was super packed and bustling. Had we wanted to sit inside, the earliest seating would've been at 7:30pm, but the heating lamp outside kept us warm and cozy! They bring you bread and butter to start. I think peak time, at least when we went, was 6pm. Around 7pm it started to get a bit emptier. The hostess mentioned reservations were by phone only. We got the cioppino and fettuccini with bay scallops. We also had a glass of the house white wine, which they let you taste before committing to it. Both dishes were delicious. Almost every table there had ordered the cioppino as well, and I definitely understand why. The crab is soft and juicy, and everything is seasoned and full of flavor. We will definitely be back!,So good. My mouth waters thinking of this place. We ordered the following:West Coast Oysters: 4/5 - A little saltier and brinier but surprisingly sweeter for west coast East Coast Oysters: 5/5 - Super sweet and fresh Seafood linguine: 4/5 - Cream sauce was creamy without being overpowering but a little on the sweeter side. Seafood portion was somewhat small Clam chowder: 5/5 - Can never go wrong with SF clam chowder! Cioppino: 5/5 - Must order! They are known for this dish. Super sizable and lots of seafood including crab legs Portions are on the larger and shareable side while prices are super fair. Service was friendly and fast.,A San Francisco classic! Absolutely love this place! The cioppino is really what they say - it's the best damn cioppino! It has an amazing tomato base with fresh crab and shrimp. I also love the scallops. The buttery garlic sauce that that they are bathed in is truly to die for. This joint doesn't take reservations so be prepared to come early or wait. Highly recommend Sotto Mare if you are a seafood fiend or just like good food.,This place is really good! The chiopinno is really good! Super special and must have when visiting SF. Everything was fresh and delicious. Would definitely recommend this place to others. Heard it's hard to get reservations so come early and get your place in line.We were first in and you will want to get here early. The place is jam packed right away. Amazing how this place fills up. You can tell this is a local favorite as well.  Friendly service and super delicious Italian flavors.,After seeing Mark Wiens try cioppino on his SF food tour video. I have been dying to try it. I have never had cioppino before, so I didn't know what to expect. Originating in San Francisco, cioppino is a dish made from  Dungeness crab, clams, shrimp, scallops, mussels, and fish combined with tomatoes and wine. I was shocked that one dish could be packed with so many different varieties of seafood. We got an order of cioppino for 3 people and we felt like it could feed at least 4 people. The seafood was fresh and sweet, which complimented the tomato and wine sauce. I loved they gave us bibs (thank you for thinking about the messy eaters!). If you are visiting San Francisco and would like to try something that was born in the Bay Area-you should not miss this! Sotto Mare is located near a lot of restaurants and Chinatown, so parking can be difficult during dinner hours. Be prepared to drive around for parking!***********My Overall Rating**********Taste: 4Price: 4Environment: 4Service: 4,Amazing seafood and buzzing atmosphere! This place is busy! If you plan to come here make sure to get reservations. Very small seating and downright cramped however totally worth it. We came on a Tuesday night and it was packed. You must try their Cioppino. Excellent and a very good portion. All the dishes we had was very tasty and did not disappoint. We had the: Benita 's Baccala, a tomato seafood compote served with dipping bread, grilled sand dabs, fettuccine with bay scallops and of course the Cioppino. Service was good, not overly attentive but kept an eye out if we needed anything. Outdoor seating is a available. Street parking only, (North Beach area) no private parking lot.   Overall a great dining experience and I recommend to those wanting a good bowl of Cioppino!,I had always wanted to come to this restaurant, and we were finally able to get a table after waiting for 1.5 hrs (we got there at 6 PM). They're usually booked Months/weeks in advance.We ordered a cioppino and West Coast oysters. Let me tell you that the West Coast oysters were absolutely horrible. They tasted so Oceany. I've had oysters before many times and none of them tasted like this. granted they were not from the West Coast, so I'm not sure if that's a West Coast thing or not.Cioppino was also not that great, but I just think cioppino is not a great dish in general. Quite honestly, I was very disappointed with everything that we ordered, but I will be returning to try a pasta dish and a salad. They looked amazing.,Had a reservation for 4 at 7pm. They told us we had to be all here to be seated. Parking is extremely difficult to find around the area so we parked close to Chinatown. We came here for the best crab cioppino only. This place did the disappoint. It was such a good balance of herbs spices savory tomato soup with the freshest seafood you can find. We loved the crab legs and the scallops that were in it. They even had some penne pasta at the bottom.It came with bread for you to eat with on the side. This place is busy as heck so make sure you make a reservation. Parties less than 3 are walk in only so try to go early. Highly recommend this place. You can tell they are a family business and care about their food a lot!,We got here at around 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon and were seated for a table of 6 outside (covered from the rain) in less than 45 min. We walked around the area and got coffee. Time went by fast. We had a buzzer with us to alert when our table was ready. We will definitely be back to try other dishes on the menu. ~ Oyster: We got 6 West Coast and 6 East Coast oysters. We all liked the East coast ones because they were sweeter. ~ Oyster Shooter: We got a round for the table and all loved it! It went down smoothly. ~ Lobster Ravioli: Lobster filling and sauce were super flavorful and enough for one person.~ Risotto with Seafood included shrimp, mussels, clam, scallops, octopus, and more. ~ Cioppino: This was my first time having this dish. It was good to share with a table of 6. We all got bibs to wear so we could get messy eating the lobster.,Considering how popular Sotto Mare is, I was surprised that I was able to get a same-day dinner reservation during peak hours. People say that the seafood here is delicious and they're most known for the Cioppino. The space looks really small and tight but we were surprised to find the basement being used for more dining space. Oysters: A little starter to get our appetites going. For non-happy-hour priced oysters, these weren't bad, coming in at $2 a piece. We only ordered as much as we wanted. Oysters tasted fine, nothing special to say. The Best Damn Crab Cioppino: One order is meant for two people. You'll find mussels, clams, octopus, and crab legs. Under all the various seafood, I was surprised to find penne pasta. And while it was good, it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I had high expectations after their claim of ""best damn."" Save some of the free bread to dip in the soup, which I thought was a better carb than the pasta. Risotto with Seafood: Because we had three people splitting the cioppino, we ordered one more thing to share. We all thought this was way better than the cioppino. The risotto was creamy and filled with seafood. There was shrimp, mussels, clams, and squid. Expensive meal but nice to try at least once! I'd be willing to come back and try all of their other seafood dishes.,Have you seen the wine prices here? It's ridiculously cheap. Taste good too.Ambience 2/5:Crowded, lively, not exactly date vibes. I sat indoors and it was small, tables were small for their big dishes. Food 5/5:  Everything was  fresh and tasty. The raw clams were crunchy and the oysters were cleaned well. The mussels  were tender and the broth that  and with it was amazing.  The linguine had a lot of clams. The pricing of this place is fair and not overpriced for the amount the give you.  Service 4/5:My waitress and the staff were all really nice. Although one point off because it was hard to get her to come to us, but still very nice and offered more bread. Drinks 4/5: For the price no complaints and they pour very very generously I would definitely come back if I'm crazy for some seafood or pasta :),I'm a believer of cioppino now! Very old school Italian restaurant in little Italy. We came during a weekday and snagged to large tables downstairs for our group. The service was pretty fast and they took our orders and served our food relatively quickly.We got the cracked crabs to share as a starter, which was so fresh and delicious. I shared the cioppino with someone and it was definitely plenty to share between 2-3 people! Never really liked the idea of a mixed seafood soup but this was so good. The tomato broth was delicious and savory and there was a lot of great seafood in it!,We came here on a Friday night. It was busy with a line out of the door, but luckily we made reservations. We followed the host to our table, which was downstairs all the way in the back near a curtain hiding some boxes. Definitely not the most inviting area of the restaurant. The waitress finally came and took our order after we'd been sitting there for a while. We ordered some calamari and oysters for the table. The oysters were not that good and calamari was just ok. I ordered the ravioli, which came out cold. My boyfriend had the risotto and wasn't too happy with his order either. Maybe we should've ordered the cioppino  since that's what their know for, but we figured being an authentic Italian restaurant they would know how to make some basic dishes.,I have been to Sotto Mare on two occasions for dinner and both times have been excellent.5/8/22 The first time I came here with my boyfriend was for our one year anniversary dinner.  He had come here before with his brother and was blown away by the quality of the food.  Sotto Mare is located in the North Beach area of the city and the times I have come to this area, parking has always been near-to impossible.  Zach dropped me off at the restaurant since our reservation was for 6PM and we were already 5-10 minutes late.      I waited alone for another 10-15 minutes and then Zach showed up after circling around looking for parking.  The restaurant was super busy and jam packed.  The host informed us that we could wait another hour for a table or to get seats at the counter which would be faster.  We opted for the countertop since we had plans after dinner and waiting an extra hour was not optimal.  Be prepared to get cozy with your neighbors...Here's what we got:1. Risotto with seafood (his)   2. Fettucine with bay scallops (mine)3. 8 oysters in half shell (to share)Our waitress at the bar was very friendly, but due to how busy it was that day, everything took a long time to come and it was difficult to get her attention when we needed something (more napkins, water refill, the check).  So service was spotty since we had long wait times.  The food though was quite amazing.  The oysters were on the smaller side, but sweet, fresh and super yummy.  The risotto and fettucine dishes were delicious.  The risotto had a wide variety of seafood and a lot of it too!  The fettucine also had a lot of scallops.  The sauce is also really creamy throughout so the pasta was not dry.  7/30/22Second time we came for dinner again, but we were accompanied by Zach's brother and wife.  We were super lucky with the parking this time around.  We managed to get a spot right around the corner.  We had a reservation but we still had to wait 20 minutes for a table to be ready.  This time, we got a table all the way in the back by the bathrooms.  Just gonna warn you ahead of time that it can get hot and stuffy back there!Here's what we got:1. Risotto with seafood (Zach and his brother both got this dish)2. Lobster ravioli (mine)  3. Calamari sauté (Brother's wife)4. Oysters in half shell (both couples got 8 to share)We also got a couple bottles of white wine to share.  We sipped on that and nibbled on bread and butter until the real food came out.  The oysters this time around were still great.  The lobster ravioli tasted fantastic but I just wish there was more of it.  From what I can recall, I think I only got 5 maybe 6 ravioli?  I was still hungry afterwards :(  I tried some of the calamari sauté, and all 4 of us agreed that it was waaaay too peppery.  The texture and the sauce was good, but the chef that day went a little wild with the pepper.Overall, the parking is a little difficult and service can be spotty, but the food is really good.  I would definitely come back again.,I've heard about Sotto Mare's cioppino for years, and yet I never found the time (or convenient parking space) to make a meal here happen. That is, until the week between Christmas and New Year's Day. And the wait was worth it. The vibe is cheerful, bright, and homey. The loads of decorations hanging off the walls and stacked in various nooks and crannies make it seem like this restaurant has been around for ages and ages. The servers are all super competent, fast-paced, and friendly. My husband and I were initially worried that we'd be facing a long wait, but either we were lucky or because most people were out of town, we were seated immediately at the high counter (a cozy experience).You sit and you suddenly have a paper towel roll, fresh bread, and butter or olive oil + balsamic vinegar at your immediate disposal. The wines and drinks are decent, but you know that you're here for the seafood and not some extensive wine list. We ordered several oysters on half shells to kick off our meal before our main course (you guessed it): The cioppino, which is $50 and generously feeds two. By the way, don't be shy about asking how to pronounce the name of this dish; you won't be the first nor the last to do so. ;)The oysters were fresh, and perhaps some of you are oyster purists who refuse to put anything on top. I didn't hesitate to add some kick to mine with the provided red cocktail sauce! For fun, we decided to order two West Coast oysters and two East Coast oysters. While I'm no oyster connoisseur... I thoroughly enjoyed the ones we were served.Then the star of the meal, the cioppino, came balanced on our server's palm and deftly placed in the spot of honor between my husband and me, with two plates, buckets for shells, and a bread refresh following suit. Hot, steaming, and sublime, this seafood stew silenced our chatter for a good twenty minutes or so, because we were too busy eating! Shrimp, octopus, crab, squid, scallops, clams, mussles - the whole medley in a rich tomato-based soup was a luxurious delight. And note, the cioppino comes with penne pasta included within the soup to add more body to the meal. So there's no need to make the mistake I did of asking for another round of bread. While their bread IS delicious, the stew can and does stand on its own without needing more carbs added on top. And... you're also given very stylish bibs to protect your clothes from splatter.Overall, I loved eating here and the food coma that followed afterwards. It was a decadent, casual, memorable meal, and I look forward to coming back again!,Absolutely the best place to meet friends to have the best Italian seafood in San Francisco. Sotto Mare serves old-school Italian seafood in an old-school Italian neighborhood. The menu is all seafood. So if you're are seafood and Italian food lover, this is the restaurant to be. This place tends to get crowded early on in the evening. Getting reservation is absolutely essential. There is no walk ins. The indoor dining is small and cramped. No much space to move around. But the service is good and efficient. It's family style restaurant. You would feel at home. The Italian food here are the best in town. Everyone orders their world famous cioppino seafood dish. We had one too to share among our group. It was delicious. The portions were generous with huge amount of seafood. The only thing we didn't like was the penne pasta came with it got soggy a bit. You have to get the steamed mussels as appetizer. We loved ours. We dipped the house bread in the wine broth and it was so good. Since San Francisco is famous for clam chowder, we also got a big order that too. It was also excellent. Highly recommend this soup. When in SF, you have to come here to experience the true SF Italian food. Mark Weins, the famous food You-tuber, have a whole vlog dedicated to this restaurant few months ago. He highly recommended this place.,Delightful place, We tried making reservations but there was not option online and no answer on phone, we came early close to when opened to try our luck and see if they had availability We got put on waitlist and about 15/20 min later we got buzzed to come in and check in, we got sited by the bar, Restaurant is very small hallway so expected to maybe be bumped by someone if sitting by the bar... Service was quickly , very loud due to small space , it was nice to see the cooks preparing the food. They only have fountain soda not canned unfortunately. I got the lobster ravioli and is was heaven , the taste spectacular , the thickness  of the sauce was on point. Absolutely delightful temperature,Very few places are a 5 star. My criteria for  while traveling is that if I visited that city again, I'd go out of my way to eat there again and that I'd highly recommend it to friends who visit the area too. Well, Sotto Mare hits the mark. I read all the recent Yelp reviews. And we got there at 4:30pm so we didn't get stuck with a 1-2 hour wait. So so glad we did.We started with the Crab Louis salad to share. I wasn't sure how I felt about getting a $33 salad to start -- till I saw it and tasted it. So much fresh crab and the dressing went perfectly. Wow. Delicious. Then we got the famous crab cioppino. There was so much hype. I was worried it might not live up to it. But thankfully it did. Definitely the best version I've had of this dish. It was most definitely enough for two. We shared. It was incredible. So many crab legs, shrimp, scallops, mussels, calamari and clams. Often there's random fish fillers in this dish -- not here. Just the good shellfish. Yum!!!Seriously I'd come back often, even at the $49 price, if I was local. 100% recommend. We sat outside and it was a lovely evening. Plus the service was great too. Next time I'm in San Francisco... I'll be back.,My experience here was terrific. The ambiance inside is loud and lively, which is really fun for me (if you want a more romantic experience, there is seating outside). The dishes are Italian with a focus on seafood, and they cover all the stuff you need to eat! The service is good as well, and our food came fast Order: We started with the Blue Cheese Wedge Salad, which was pretty yummy and bleu cheeselicious (lol). We then got a Boston Clam Chowder which was good; nothing crazy though. We also got the cioppino which was so dam good!!! It was stocked to the brim with seafood and filled us up. We paired it with the Risotto with Seafood which was terrific. PS: try putting some risotto and rice in your bowl and add the cioppino base to make a fun porridge-type meal (so yum).,I was very excited to try this iconic place since I have seen and heard so many incredible things about it. However, I was let down extremely quick. The entire place is claustrophobic, we had to squeeze our way past tables and tiny hallways to finally get to our seat, which was located downstairs allllll the way in the back. We ordered the oysters, wedge salad, and I had the scallops as my entree. The scallops definitely saved the night. They were sautéed in a delicious garlic and lemon sauce. Even my husband preferred my scallops over his main dish.The oysters were just ok. Nothing amazing, and not memorable. I wouldn't order these again.The wedge salad was small and again just ok. Keep in mind also this place always has a long line and reservations book quick. If you really want to dine here, book ahead of time.,The friggin lobster ravioli. IT IS TO DIEEEEE FOR. Not literally. But oh. my. goodness. You must come here and try. LOOOOOOOK  AT THE PICTURE! LOOK AT ALL THAT SAUCE! Look at the amount of food. Look at the luscious goodness that oozes throughout the plate. Look look look!!!! They provide you a side of bread and I swear to the holy name of that cross, dip yo bread in this ravioli sauce and you are living the dream. It's a carb dream come true. Not only that, but you have this amazing amazing Cioppino. Enough for 2. Go on a date here, you're sure to have leftovers. A very very pleasant experience right when you walk in. You're greeted by this lady who I believe is the owner and she's so accommodating! I asked for a seat inside and she said yes!!! Very kindly ! We ended up sitting at the bar in front of the chefs! It was awesome to see them cook up a storm! By the way, they use TONS OF BUTTER!!! BUTTER ME UP HONEYYYYYY AYYYYYY! So definitely, if you dip your bread in your ravioli sauce , no need for extra butter, unless you really really wanna feel happiness (cause butter make me happy)Next, we got OYSTERS!!!!!! Yooo my man, or girl, cop this half shell a feel cause the cocktail sauce that goes with this is beyond compare. No idea what they do with it but it is sooooooo frigging good. You know, if you wanna suck on something tonight, go an take a nice little watery swim with these oysters cause you gonna be doing a little happy dance. Cioppino. Just get it . Whoever you are. Just do it. As long as you ain't allergic or you really don't like seafood....Sotto mare is so so fogging good (hahaha get it? It's cause we in SF) come here and don't have any regrets.,My bf and I came to Sotto Mare for dinner during our first night in San Fran! The wait was long, as expected. We were seated inside and it was a little stuffy (which I didn't mind since it was chilly outside). Towards the back of restaurant, it was super smokey since the grills are in the backOn to food, we got the famous crab cioppino, lobster ravioli, and scallops. The scallops were cooked perfectly, a tad salty, but overall SO good. The crab cioppino was good, flavorful and full of crab and seafood. I would definitely pass on the lobster ravioli, I didn't really taste lobster and just tasted like regular ravioli. Food was good but not sure if I would come back if I had to wait so long!,We came here with a party of six for a Thursday night dinner. We booked a reservation a few weeks in advance with no problem. When we arrived there was a line to check in, and it took about 15 minutes for us to get to the front and be checked in. As soon as we got to the front we gathered our party and walked downstairs. The first thing we noticed was how hot it was down there. They had a fan going, but it was a bit uncomfortable.Our waitress greeted us promptly and gave us menus. We knew what we wanted to order already so we ordered pretty quickly a bunch of things to share family-style. To split we got: two cioppinos, multiple cups and bowls of their Boston clam chowder, a crab louie salad, a wedge salad, lobster ravioli, 1.5 dozen oysters, grilled sand dabs and a whole Dungeness crab.When I tell you everything was incredibly fresh and perfectly cooked...I mean it! They were so generous with the portions, and you felt like you were getting what you paid for. Highlights were the cioppino (of course), sand dabs, the whole crab, and the crab louie salad. (But tbh everything was amazing and would order everything again).Again, only complaint was that it was boiling down there, and it felt like it got hotter as the meal went on. We will definitely be back and highly recommend! See you soon, Sotto Mare!,We came here on a weekday for dinner. Street parking was a little difficult to find, and there was a 30-45min wait.We got seated and ordered some oysters and the famous cioppino. We wanted to order another pasted but the waiter said that the cioppino would be enough for the two of us. The oysters were standard, a little fishy. The cioppino took a little while to arrive, so we nibbled on some bread while we waited. The cioppino was good and the seafood was fresh. The portions were huge and the two of us couldn't finish it. Overall the food was good, will need to return to try more of the menu.,Even though they don't take reservations and the place was hopping around 6pm, we were able to snag 2 spaces on the counter immediately.Although a majority of the reviews were about their Cioppino, my husband and I were just not in the mood for Cioppino last night...so we opted to try other items on their menu. I went with half a doesn't east coast oysters and the Calamari Saute Aglio Olio. My husband had a house salad and the Linguine with Seafood. The oysters were delicious and I enjoyed the Calamari...even though m",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 husband didn't care for it. His house salad was a big disappointment. It was just sliced iceberg lettuce with a few tomatoes. Worst yet, the iceberg lettuce was a little brown...like it was cut a while back and had been sitting there. Good thing the linguine was good. I also need to mention that the bread was really good. Light and crispy. Perfect to soak up all the sauces.Our waitress was very nice. I was amazed on how efficient they were in watching them from the counter.With so many great Italian restaurants in SF," I think we will only return when we are in the mood to try their """"Best Damn Crab Cioppino"""".",What a great restaurant! Simply delicious food! I highly recommend it for sure!!! The restaurant is super super busy, be ready to wait for little bit! The vibes really nice from inside, it is not that big but you can sit inside or outside. We ordered: Crab Louis Salad : $33 Yes expensive salad but it's worth it for sure! Good amount of crab meat, with sauce on side, very light and yummy if you like crab meat, the sauce was okay not a big fan of it, but I like crab for sure. Cioppino : $49Oh my oh my!!!! Full of sea food and delicious soup!!!! 10/10 for sure!!! You will not regret it at all, the seafood so fresh and tasty!!!! Customer service was good, not bad, little bit slow but because they are super busy! We understand that. Go enjoy it and be ready to be full! Good amount of food! Will be back soon for sure!,I came here a few times for the cioppino and had to say it's the best in the city. It's a very flavorful bowl full of seafood. Crab is my favorite out of the mix of seafood in the bowl. They also give you bread to go along with your soup, and it's from Sf boudin. It's San Francisco in a meal. I would recommend everyone to check out this place, and also, the bowl is for sharing. The service is alright, not the best, but it can be because they are always busy. Expect to wait for a table, and they only take reservations for 3+ parties.,Such a great stop on my first visit to SF! I am so lucky I had a friend/guide to make a reservation here. We stopped on a weeknight and the place was packed! Would recommend making a reservation anytime you are trying to go. I love how original it feels. It's also small inside so be prepared to be packed in! We ordered the famous Cioppino and it was well worth it! It's big enough for 2-3 people. I'd never even heard of it before this trip and from the description wasn't so sure. It was delicious. It's like a brothy soup filled with all kinds shellfish. We also had the scallops and shrimp with lemon. Both were delicious. Will be going back next time we're in SF!,This place had great tasting food! All the food items were great portions and balanced flavors. Both the food and drinks were fairly priced and enjoyable. I would love to come back here and try some new dishes. For the ambiance and service, I think it was decent. The ambiance is very classic SF vibes because they are limited on space. So I understand that. The servers were very tentative and fast, but my only frustration was the inaccurate wait time. My fiancée and I had the expectation of waiting 1-1.5 hours. We planned to go across the street for a glass of wine while we waited. When I arrived the hostess let me know it would only be a few minutes for the first available table. I was excited that we got to eat earlier than planned! She gave me a pager and we ended up waiting for 50 mins. Because our expectations were set for a few minutes, I grew frustrated. So that put a dampener on our first experience.But overall, the food was good and I would come back.,This place is lovely! Super cute with great food and service. We came on a Tuesday around 7 and were lucky to be seated right away, otherwise it was pretty full both inside and outside. We started with oysters on the half shell; they were good and not super fishy which was nice. Next came fettuccine with scallops which was great! Although I was expecting larger scallops, these little guys were still good and were cooked well. The sauce on the pasta was incredible- so rich and flavorful, yet light. Definitely planning on coming back to try the cioppino! I saw a few people order it, and it looked amazing.,I have been here two times already and they both were amazing!! The consistency in service is phenomenal! The hostess seated us quickly even it was very busy, the waiter gave us water, gave us the time we needed and didn't feel rushed, and everything else came in a timely manner. They didn't come too often when our food came out which is great because I don't like being bothered too often but they made sure we were taken care of!The food was jaw dropping good! I got the Salmon Fettuccine and it was not too creamy not too watery. The salmon was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth! The lobster ravioli was so buttery and seasoned perfectly! This was such a great experience and I understand why it is one of the top rated restaurants in San Francisco! having a small menu definitely makes it easier for them to perfect each and every dish.,I love Sotto Mare! It's one of the restaurants that I recommend when people ask what to eat in SF. Of course, the cioppino is delicious - lots of seafood and penne in a flavorful broth. However, my favorite dish had to be the fettuccine with smoked salmon. It is SO decadent and creamy and will definitely knock you into a food coma after. I don't believe they take reservations for small parties. Ambiance is cool - they have a sailor/ocean theme going on, which is fitting for their restaurant and location.,Messy crowded fun place for reasonably priced seafood! The seating was very hard to get, our table of four took about an hour. That said everything else was great. Cioppinos portion was generous and full of crab meat and mussles, tomato soup base was hearty. The pasta was optional in my option :p. Overall very satisfying meal for the amount of seafood we got.,My son and I had a Mama Son Day and this was our first stop!  He chose everything we did this day and oh em gee! Ingres up I'm San Francisco as was he but he's found more hidden gems in his young life then I have in 50 plus years! This IS HANDS DOWN A HIDDEN GEM! Servings are plentiful and delish! We even had a dozen fresh oysters! The host was MEH but our server and busier were AMAZING! Can't wait to go back!,"When you visit a """"mom and pop"""" type of establishment", you already know you're in for pure goodness. Sotto Mare is one of a kind, and I want to visit again.Inside is on the smaller side, very cramped, but the service is out of this world.We sat at the bar and enjoyed marinated Dungeness crabs. I can't explain the seasoning on those crabs, but baby! You will not go wrong with this appetizer. Do yourself a favor, get yourself two. Thank me later!My entree was the sautéed scallops with prawns. Broccoli and carrots accompanied the main event. The sauce in this dish?! Ask for some bread because it is a must to sop up that sauce! Delicious. Winner. I can't rave enough about Sotto Mare. Hats, shoes, clothes, everything off to the chef!,It was a rainy evening and we got lucky with a table at Sotto Mare. Ordered one plate of fettuccine with pomodoro sauce, one pasta with scallops and a glass of Pinot Noir. Have to say neither meal was special, but also perhaps we didn't order wisely. Service was swift, not very friendly. We probably would have been open to suggestions if offered. Nice outdoor seating (see photo). Indoor looked tight, but cozy. I don't want to mark down too much as I wish I had ordered the sand dabs. Probably would have been a better choice. Make sure you research the menu before you go in as they are not going to guide you.,Such a busy spot, but that goes to show how good the food is! We came as a party of 2 on a weekday dinner and were so lucky to have gotten seated outside. We shared the scallops and cioppino. The food was so fresh and flavorful and we kept asking for more bread to soak up the amazing soup. The serving sizes were extremely generous and we had plenty to take home. A must-visit if you're in SF and want some quality seafood!,Heard good things about this place. Made a reservation for Saturday night, group of 4. We parked in a garage a few blocks away. The layout reminds me of Swan Depot (crammed diner space). Very crowded and loud environment.My party and I got:- A dozen oysters (west & east coast)- Fettuccine w bay scallop- Seafood risotto- Grilled sand dabs- Boston clam chowder - Lobster ravioli- The infamous cioppino. The best part was the creamy buttery risotto. The fish fillets (sand dabs) were light and tasty too. The fettuccine was underwhelming and unfortunately there was nothing special about the clam chowder or cioppino. Glad to have tried it but probably won't return due to the location and seafood can get pretty pricey.,My friend and I stopped by the minute it opened on Sunday. We ordered a dozen oysters (half West Coast, half East--I would go for the West Coast ones as they had more meat to them), Fettucine with Smoked Salmon, and Linguine with Seafood (tomato sauce). Overall, the seafood was incredibly fresh and the service was fast. It satisfied my Italian food craving, but nothing stood out in particular.,One of the saddest things is when you see someone or something that was once great decline right before your eyes. Like when a once proud, witty, strong, fast boxer like Muhammed Ali, still considered to be the greatest of all time loses his ability due to Father Time.Well Sotto Mare's heyday is unfortunately over. Not only have the surrounding restaurants passed them up in quality of food but price-wise as well. Fortunately for Sotto Mare, their name alone still has customers flocking to eat here. But here's the disappointing entrees I ordered:Crab Louis: this is crab with lettuce. Boring. Like a sixth grade history teacher.Sauté Scallops: this dish was slimy and salty. Seafood risotto: the one decent dish we ate. Probably the only dish I would order here.Cioppino: worst damn cioppino in North Beach. The restaurant next door has better cioppino and I can name a few more just within a block of here.Service was ok. Not good and not bad. But overall, I won't be coming back to eat here. It's overpriced and just not very good. It's really sad to see something that was once a solid restaurant decline like it has.,We've been here a few times now after our initial visit and the cioppino is still amazing and the best ever. It's an incredible bowl of seafood, penne pasta and a perfectly crafted broth. We came early on a Friday night after driving to the city. We only had to wait ten minutes for a spot at the counter, a prime spot to be in the middle of all the action. We also ordered the seafood linguine to share and the flavor of the creamy sauce was delicious and not too heavy. This pasta dish was loaded with seafood! All of the staff was friendly, kind and attentive even though they were constantly busy. Sotto Mare continues to be one of our favorite restaurants in SF! We'll always come back!!!,We wanted a place close to/walking distance to Club Fugazi. I chose Sotto Mare because I wanted Italian and seafood. Disappointed that they don't take reservations for two. We had to sit at the bar facing the kitchen rather than each other at a table. The tall chairs are hard on my back and it is claustrophobic as they really pack 'um in, shoulder to shoulder. Very intimate. The cioppino was excellent but also $49.95!! The cup of clam chowder was tasty but barely warm. I will only go back if there are 3 or more of us w reservations. Most of the staff was good. Our waitress was rude, pushy and not very attentive. Enjoyed watching the kitchen staff lock butt. Busy hustle bustle scene.,Had the freshest raw little neck clams that I have ever had. I've been up and down the East Coast eating many of the little critters, but this place has the absolute best. First time that I've ever experienced a sweetness of clams. The prawns were excellent, however, the sauce was even better!Definitely, can't wait to go back!,Delicious! Able to accommodate us within 20 mins with no reservations. We all got fettuccine Alfredo. I got bay scallops. Family got plain and smoked salmon. Amazing. Generous with wine pours and bread. Will be back.,The 'Best damn crab cioppino' is pretty spot-on at sotto mare. Fire meal with pasta, crab meat, shrimp, mussels, tomatoes, soup YUMM - DEFINITELY enough for 3 or even 4 small people. I shared this with my friend and had plenty of take-out left - would recommend if you're dining in (not sure if proportions are different in the takeout version) They give complimentary bread like most traditional Italian locations, with butter and a refill, and bibs to avoid spilling on your clothes. The restaurant is rlly rlly busy esp at nights, but you can make reservations for groups of 3 or more (recommend calling to reserve in advance if you're looking to eat at popular times). I came with my friend right when they opened at 11:30am on Saturday and got seated immediately.I've gotten delivery here before too and the smoked salmon pasta is SOO good!,O M GAre you here yet?The best damn Cioppino is not just a slogan, it is a true statement in my opinion.,"I love me some Italian seafood. I enjoyed every meal that I ate here. The oysters on half shell tasted so yummy and fresh. The """"best damn crab cioppino"""" tasted delicious (and that's saying a lot because I'm usually not a fan of tomato soups). The cioppino is a seafood dream - it's a wonderful savory soup filled with  mussels", crab, scallops, clams, shrimp, penne pasta. I mean, what's there not to love? Perfect for a brisk, chilly day! One of those meals that just warms your soul. Come early because this place can get packed during rush time.,We came here with a reservation, had to wait a couple of minutes for our table to be ready. Got seated downstairs (it does get pretty warm down there). Our waiter was very friendly, as she helped us with good recommendations.I got the Boston Clam Chowder and the Linguine with Seafood -The Boston Clam Chowder was yummy. Now, I highly recommend getting the Linguine with Seafood. I destroyed it. It was so so good! Everything about the dish was perfect.Great experience overall.,Yessss! It's the best damn Cioppino. But the day we had it, seafood in our bowl were pretty small. But the taste was marvelous for both dishes.Even we had it on the hot Summer day and soaked in sweat, it's worth to try it out when you arrive SF!,Sotto Mare is a seafood gem that I'd easily recommend to anyone visiting the city. I heard the cioppino was iconic and after visiting with a few friends, I can easily see why!First off the atmosphere of the restaurant is incredible. It's lively, it's bright, yet small enough to feel cozy. The wait staff were incredibly friendly and all of this came together to make an excellent dining experience. Of course, Sotto Mare is famous for its cioppino so we ordered it for all of us while also trying our own dishes! The cioppino was incredible flavorful and really any bite of it you could've took would've filled your mouth with wonderful seafood flavors. Nothing was overpowering, too salty, or disharmonious! Everything really came together and the serving was also super generous for SF standards. It's quite easy to see why the cioppino is considered a must order, and I'd gladly agree!As for entrees, I ordered the cod with lemon butter special and I found it to be excellent as well! The fish was beautifully cooked and still moist, the lemon butter coated the slightly seared skin of the cod extraordinarily well and I gobbled everything up within five minutes!Whether you've tried cioppino before or if you're just a seafood fan, Sotto Mare is a must try restaurant for anyone looking for amazing seafood!,Order: Crab Cioppino, Seafood Risottotldr; overrated cioppino, nice vibes though Came here bc there seemed to be a lot of hype about the cioppino in the reviews and also for the pasta. We were worried that we were too late since we got there at like 8:58pm and Google said it closes at 9 but the lady at the front was very nice and got us seated right away. The restaurant had a lot of interesting items and photos all over the walls which was pretty cool. Risotto was quite dry and didn't have much seafood flavor. Wouldn't get again. 3/10They gave us bibs to wear so the cioppino wouldn't splash on us. Kind of fun. The cioppino had lots of seafood, but there was a lot of overcooked penne pasta filling space at the bottom. The soup tasted kinda just like tomato soup. Tasted good, but not like something extraordinary. 6/10,A must have in the city! Fresh Seafood... wine...  authentic SF vibes. I stumbled upon this place by accident with my best friend now she wants to go every time she's in the city.Great service, quick and delish!,This place has been in my list to visit for a while now. And I finally got to go and try their cioppino which they're known for. I will not talk about the wait time (we didn't wait that long) or parking (there's a lot right across and at $20 is not bad). I will not talk about how small the place is and how packed they are. What I will talk about is the cioppino and the seafood linguini which both are as good as I expected. And for the cost to ingredient ratio, the food can't be beat. Both of the dishes had a lot of seafood and the cioppino, a good amount of crab. The sauces are flavorful and definitely soaks up the bread they give you. If I were to nitpick, I would say that they could make them more spicy. But, they have red pepper flakes on the table. Fabi who attended to us at the counter was wonderful! She made the dinner so much better. Would definitely go back.,I came here on a whim with a friend after finding this place on Yelp! We came on a weekday evening and there was a 30 minute wait. You can leave a credit card with them and they'll give you a buzzer which will alert you when your table is ready. We had oysters (west coast), clam chowder, and the seafood pasta which were all delicious but nothing that particularly stood out. There's complimentary bread and butter which is always a plus.The cioppino looked a little too big for just the two of us but would definitely come back to give it a try!,Best pasta in sf hands down!! Wish I tried their cioppino, but got their seafood linguine for a reasonable price. As a Bay Area native, I've got to say it is pretty rare to find bomb Italian food for a reasonable price around here. Funny thing, I actually tried coming here a few months ago, and they told me there was going to a few hour wait!! Unfortunate for the wait, but definitely worth it! Just make sure to reserve prior and I do recommend to take a stroll around the area... there's some really cute pubs and little boutiques around!,"I came here for a dinner after work around 5:50 PM with my brother. We were fortunate enough to only need to wait around 5 minutes for seats. The service was incredible - they served us free bread almost as soon as we sat down and the food came out super quickly. They also gave us these super cute bibs to wear during our meal.We ordered four west coast oysters to start and then the best damn cioppino"""" as the main of course. The oysters were AGGRESSIVELY fresh. I'm honestly struggling to express what that means exactly. Maybe part of it was because they were chilled but they tasted so fresh my jaw dropped. A few droplets of lemon juice and a dash of their slightly spiced cocktail sauce added a delightful seasoning to the oyster. The cioppino was also incredible. The bowl contained massive portions of crab", shrimp, clams, mussels, squid," and pasta. The seafood was all so tender and complemented perfectly by the tomato base. The bowl also did a fantastic job of keeping the food warm even tho we were sitting outside.I usually don't rave about seafood unless it's sushi but the whole commute back I (and my brother) kept saying """"wow that was really good"""". This was the first time I ordered a cioppkno so it was definitely the best I've ever had but I think it would be very difficult for another to top this. If you have the opportunity to I definitely recommend trying """"the best damn cioppino"""" at Sotto Mare.",I came here for lunch since I've always wanted to see what the hype for this place was. It definitely did not disappoint! We went around 1pm, and waited for about 10 minutes for a table of two. Service was quick and friendly despite a large crowd of customers! We ordered the cioppino and linguine with seafood - definitely way too much food for two people, but everything looked so good! The cioppino was very hearty and flavorful - I especially loved the abundance of seafood and the tomato rich broth! My only minor complaint was that there was way too much pasta, and it got a bit mushy towards the bottom of the bowl. The linguine was also delicious, but not nearly as good as the cioppino! I'd definitely come back again just for their cioppino - an amazing restaurant in North Beach!,Delicious Italian restaurant  Everything was passionately cooked and flavorful. Not a trace of anything left on our plates. Server was friendly, attentive, and made us feel at home. Can't wait until next time!,I heard about Sotto Mare's Cioppino on social media and immediately wanted to pay this place a visit.Sotto Mare is located in the heart of San Francisco's Little Italy. If you didn't already know Cioppino is a San Francisco creation many years ago," fishermen would """"chip in"""" whatever they caught that day and put it in the soup. Sotto Mare is know for the """"Best Damn Cioppino""""", it's $49.95 and it was enough for four of us to share and still have some left over. It's a delicious seafood soup that's perfect for warming your belly up on a cold San Francisco day. We also ordered their Seafood Risotto for the table which was very enjoyable and appetizing! In addition, we got their oysters which are only $2 each.  I washed down my meal with one of their Bellini Cocktails. They also serve complimentary bread for those of you wondering haha. Sotto Mare is the perfect place to come as a family! Their portion sizes are great for groups! I must say though that the place is very small and super popular so there will most likely be a long wait but I promise it's worth it!,I've been wanting to give Sotto Mare a try for years now and finally got a chance to pay this establishment a visit last night. The first thing to note is, they don't take reservations unless you have a party of 3 or more. To avoid having to wait in line during the dinner rush, we decided to do an early dinner. Around 5 pm when we arrived, we were able to get a table for 2 right away inside. We were immediately greeted and got our drink orders in. We decided to start off our meal with a plate of oysters to share - the west coast oysters are a little bigger with brighter tasting notes while the east coast oysters are smaller and sweeter. We decided to do a plate of 8 oysters, 4 of each kind, to sample both flavors. I was a big fan of the west coast oysters - although they're bigger, they're still relatively small and are easy to go down. For our main, we decided to split an order of the Best Damn Crab Cioppino. As the name states, this was literally the best damn crab cioppino either my husband or I have had. There is so much fresh seafood packed into this bowl, the broth is rich and savory, and they even include penne pasta into the stew to help make the dish even more hearty and to balance out the flavors and texture of the rest of the dish. You're also provided with delicious crusty bread throughout the meal that is so delicious dipped into the savory broth, or just by itself with bread or some olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Yum. I don't believe they have dessert here, just an FYI for anyone where dessert is an absolute must. Overall, we had a great meal at Sotto Mare and I can't wait for our next visit!,Friend suggested to come here for their cioppino so we came.  Lunch on a Thursday is without wait and we could even pick our seat.  If you dine inside, the fragrance of garlic and seafood is stronger and appetizing.The wine recommendation is reasonable and we tried Sangiovese and Tebrino which are rare to find.  For food of course we ordered the crab cioppino for 2 to share. It's ok, more buttery than spicy or heavy in tomato sauce compared to Phil's Fish Market. It has bay scallop, shrimp, crab, clams, mussels and penne pasta (but no fish). Some people may like it without the pasta, but I can see the cost reason for it. The dish is about $45, so it's a good price to share. Friend's comment was that it was a bit bland.For me this is like a check the box kind of meal, glad we tried this restaurant and now we can move on.,What can I say? Sotto Mare never fails to deliver when it comes to their classic Cioppino! It's $50 worth of their giant bowl of a seafood variety, mixed with a ton of pasta," and of course poured over with their tasty soup. My friends and I came here for a little """"appetizer""""", but we realized this was more than we could handle lol I'm not even kidding, their cioppino is actually pretty filling.It gets very packed here easily, so I do recommend getting a reservation of some kind. When we got seated, we were given complimentary sourdough bread and butter as a starter. Me and my two friends wanted to get the cioppino, so we just got that only. I haven't had this in forever here. so it was really nice to get to try this out once again. And might I say it was so so good! It's the Best-Damn-Cioppino-Ever! When we got out bowl, they give you so a generous amount of seafood in your bowl. For $50 worth of seafood and food, I think it was well worth the price. They give you things like crab, shrimp, squid, mussels, and clams. And underneath the seafood is a ton of pasta drizzled over with their tomato-based soup. It's so good. I can definitely see why this place's specialty revolves around this giant bowl of goodness. I've also never had Cioppino that is as good as theirs as well. Would I come back again? Most definitely, and I would highly recommend bringing friends to try this too because this bowl is huge!!,What a wonderful evening at Sotto Mare. After spending some time at our hotel post flight our group of four made our way over to the restaurant for a 5:30 reservation. We had the cioppino for two as an appetizer and split it four ways. For the record of this is a meal for just two people they must be the hungriest two in all of San Francisco as it is a bunch of food!We then decided to split several entrees including the lobster ravioli, fresh grilled corvina and also had a few cups of clam chowder too. Everything tasted great and we were stuffed! The North Beach area was fun to walk around in afterwards too!,The best Damn Crab Cioppino in SF! Came here to celebrate my hubby's birthday and he loved everything about Soto Mare! The food, service and ambiance is excellent! There is outdoor seating. We say inside at the bar area. The chefs are amazing to watch cook the meals and help get the orders out fast! This will be our go to!,Cioppino was to die for! All of the seafood was cooked perfectly and super tasty. I love how they slightly crack the crab to make it easier while eating. This dish is very fulfilling! Lobster ravioli was super tasty! Love how it's all homemade. Scallops here are cooked to perfection. The sear that is obtained is like no other. Gordon Ramsay would be so impressed coming here and having their scallops. This was a complete experience and I enjoyed every moment here. Follow my food journey on social media @MugsyEats | Where everyone eats!,Cioppino Cioppino Cioppino Cioppino Cioppino!!!!!!! Oh my gosh the Cioppino here is AMAZING!!!! Seriously yum!!!!! Great soup flavor, lots of fresh, perfectly cooked seafood, and super reasonably priced too! Bring a friend because it's designed to be shared! What's not amazing?!? The long wait. You get a buzzer but can't wander that far (basically just to the ends of the block). They should switch to a phone system so people can at least hang out in Washington Square Park, which is just an extra block away, or to some of the pastry shops nearby. We were also quoted an hour wait and it ended up being closer to 2 hours. The staff is super busy and a bit terse, but the place is always packed so that's to be expected. Come for the Cioppino, but don't stay too long because there are other hungry people waiting in line! Also, when you sit down you may feel the urge to immediately stuff your face with bread because you're hungry and have been staring at everyone else's Cioppino for the past 2 hours. Resist the urge: the Cioppino is worth the wait and also comes with a pile of penne at the bottom that will get a little too soft if you wait too long. And the bread just isn't as good as everything in the Cioppino (plus the bread with the soup tastes great). Can't wait to be back!,Located in a busy street in North Beach and this place is a must try and after you try it, you would always just keep coming back. Not just the food is great but the owner and our servers were all nice. I would say the price of the food is cheap but it is reasonable for the amount of serving they give you. The cioppino is a must!! The seafood risotto is just so good, you're gonna start comparing it to other restaurants. Also ordered the mussel and clam steamers, so good!  Even the white wine we had was great. I wish I took a picture. This place is exceptional. One advice, they get really busy during lunch and especially dinner time so I suggest make a reservation. Unfortunately they don't make reservation for1- 2 people.Try their pastas too, we usually order it via DoorDash when we crave for sotto mare.,Finally made it to this essential SF institution on a Sunday at around 4:15pm. For 2 of us we were seated right away outside. Definitely came at a good time since it was a bit too late for lunch and a bit too early for dinner- but we didn't mind! We of course ordered the Cioppino ($50) to share- which did not disappoint. So many treasures inside and the tomato broth was amazing- especially dipped in the bread they gave. They also gave you a bib to wear over your clothes. Maybe a tad too much pasta- but honestly can't complain! We also got a half a dozen west coast oysters ($2/oyster), which were great and half a carafe of the house red wine ($20). They were pretty busy, but service was quick! Perfect amount to share for early sunday meal. Now that I've checked off the cioppino, I definitely be back to try the rest of the menu (or order another cioppino).,Just a short stroll outside of Chinatown into Little Italy, you will find this quaint gem. The atmosphere is welcoming and obviously a popular neighborhood spot based on the constant flow of people. We opted to sit at the bar and enjoy our meal and glasses of wine. The music is great and they mix it up so there's something everyone can enjoy. If you're seafood fan and in San Francisco, you should stop in.,There's a reason why this place has been open for over 50 years. At this point, it's a SF institution and came here for the first time last week. And will be coming back for years to come. Bottom line, it's high quality seafood for very reasonable prices. Make sure to make a reservation as it's always packed. Cioppino - loaded with a ton of seafood (shrimp, scallops, mussels, clams, crab legs) and pasta. First time having pasta in my cioppino but it paired so well. Also kudos to them for semi breaking the shell of the crab so I don't have to:) 10/10 would get again tbh, it's more than enough for 2. Scallops - perfectly cooked and so juicy. Also the caper and lemon sauce was to die for. I used the bread to soak up all the sauce. A must get dish here!!Halibut - tender and flakey fillet. The sauce was very light and complements the fish nicely. Veggies were nice too! If you're looking for a quality restaurant that represents the SF spirit, this is the place! Hosts were amazing, food was delicious, and ambiance was perfect. Only minor complaint was the wait time on food. We probably waited close to 30 minutes for our food to come out. But good food is worth the wait :),This place had good reviews and decided to try it out for lunch. Is a small place but has outdoor seating as well. Place was busy but we were able to get a table inside. We ordered the seafood risotto, the grilled salmon, and the fettuccine with bay scallops. The food did not disappoint. It was fresh and delicious. Really recommend the risotto, so good. Prices were reasonable and plates can be shareable.,I have been meaning to go to Sotto Mare for some time now and I am happy that I was finally able to stop by. The restaurant itself is pretty quaint," with decor that essentially screams """"we are a humble and classic SF seafood restaurant"""" with its framed photos and fishermen decor. Once seated", I ordered the linguini with seafood, with pesto sauce. While the linguini is typically served with either a white cream or pomodoro (tomato) sauce, the server helpfully informed me that the cooks could substitute the dish with another sauce of my choosing (which were also listed on the menu).The linguini with seafood was quite good, so if you are a pasta lover like I am, it is a solid choice. Just a heads up, but on a hot day in SF, it can get a bit stuffy in the restaurant whether you are seated indoors or outdoors. However, you do not have to be too concerned, as hot days are not all too common in the city.,I always find myself walking here when I visit San Francisco for the welcoming familiar faces in the staff, the hustle and bustle of the restaurant as well as the food. On my recent visit I brought a friend- I was hoping we could split the Cioppino but no such luck. Apparently, she had a tomato issue. Oh well, one day. I make my own and I know there's will be good because I've watched countless people wearing their bibs, dismantling the large pieces of crab and enjoying themselves. I usually get the mussels or the mussels and clams with a glass of Pinot Grigio or Chardonnay. It's always perfect for me and I love sitting at the counter especially when I'm alone because I feel so much more apart of the place. To me it's the heart. Looking forward to going back again-soon.,Cioppino and sauté scallops are  worth it. Great customer service.  Go early because they get really busy!,The cioppino is fantastic! My friend ordered the halibut- it was perfectly cooked and really tasty. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Both times we've been there we had fantastic service. Loved our waitresses! Just be patient about getting a table and be very nice to the hostess. She's actually a VIP there!There's a reason they've stayed in business for so long. Eat there and you'll understand.,Went to Sotto Mare with a large party for a birthday celebration. When more guests showed up than anticipated on the reservation, staff was accommodating and expanded our outdoor seating.The complimentary bread/butter was average only because of the temperature, although they were very generous as our large party consumed many loaves. Corkage was reasonable at 15$ per bottle.d The service was quite responsive, with glasses provided reasonably quickly and replacement silverware quickly delivered. We ordered: Oysters (6 West Coast, 6 East coast) on half shell, combination steamers of clams + mussels, the Signature Cioppino for two, the Lobster Ravioli, the Seafood Risotto, Seafood Linguini, Clam Linguini, as well as the clam chowder. The oysters were incredibly fresh and at 2-3$ a piece, an incredible deal. Some of the best oyster's we've had at this price point. The clams/mussels steamer arrived rather quickly and finished in equal time by our party. The Seafood Cioppino (various seafood: crab, clams, mussels, etc. in a tomato-based broth along with penne and linguini) was the star of the show. It is meant for two people, but one member of our party was able to finish his own order. The Risotto was well cooked, and very generous portion as well -- both members of our party who ordered were almost unable to finish their dishes n their own.The clam linguini was also very well done, highlighted by the white sauce. 5/5 for food, service, accommodation of large party. Looking forward to coming back!Not pictured: Ravioli, Scallops, Clam Chowder, Seafood Linguini,Whoa whoa whoa hold up, the Cioppino here was excellent! One order is definitely enough to feed two ($50). The broth is exciting lol. What I mean by that is that its flavors are many and delicious. The stars of the broth were the garlic, tomato, and I believe white wine. It was not salty! It also came with an extremely generous amount and diversity of seafood (shrimp, crab, scallops, clams, calamari). Oh and penne noodles.Thankfully, they give you free bread on the side (outer layer was harder to chew than expected). Refills are free.SUPER busy street and restaurant. They have a system where they hold your card while you hold onto a buzzer. It took around 40 minutes for a party of two to be seated.Service was pretty quick despite the busy nature of the place.,Great food, good service the bestCioppino i ever had in San Francisco, fresh oyster, my wife love the pasta , My Son order the crab salad it is to die for definitely will come back to this place soon,Came here to try Cioppino - where it originates. Food is okay nothing to exciting. But seafood are perfectly cooked. The lady server was mean! Food was served late also, Insisted to give minimum gratuity.,Outstanding cioppino. Fantastic upbeat vibrant North Beach atmosphere. Comfortable and relaxed but with that North Beach electricity.,Service: Service could have been better. Although they were attentive, they weren't very friendly (even to each other). Food: They start you off with complementary bread and you have the option to make the lil olive oil and balsamic vinegar mix Italian places always have. The bread was not warm at all once we got it, I can't remember if it used to be baked and warm before when I used to come here. The risotto with seafood is so good. Appearance-wise, when I first saw it, I was kinda lowkey thinking my home-made risotto was going to beat it, but once I took a bite, everything changed. This surpassed all my expectations. Everything down to the texture, flavor, and variety was nailed. All I can say is, if you're coming here, don't doubt that seafood risotto. The Fettuccine with bay scallops on the other hand, looked very good, but once I bit into it, the lack of seasoning was evident. I ended up just putting a bit of black pepper in there to kick up the flavor a bit. Tip: We came here in between lunch and dinner time so we were seated really quick.,Always have a great experience here. Great food, great atmosphere. If you don't mind sitting at the counter, try to get seated by the kitchen. You can watch them cook while you wait on your food. Portions are pretty big so come w an appetite!!!,The hype was real. Don't be discouraged by the long wait, the food made up for it. The staff are friendly, kind, and attentive despite being outnumbered by guests. The star of the evening for us, the Cioppino. For $50 you get a meal for a king. The large bowl consists of snow crab legs, clams, mussels, shrimp and scallops. All of it is cooked in a tomato and wine based broth. I can't begin to describe how flavorful and refreshing this soup was. We never eat bread and ended up devouring the loaf (used to dip in the broth). Another favorite dish for me, the clam linguine in cream sauce. I could eat this fish for daaaaays. Yes it was creamy and rich, but not to the point where you get bored eating. We paired the dinner with a bottle of Chardonnay and we're glad we chose this place for dinner. This place was so good we decided eating here for dinner for both nights that we stayed in SF.,This place is amazing!!!! We came in without a reservation and they still sat us within a minute. Our dinner came out to be $60 per person and everything was so well priced and prepared, worth the nice meal, service and ambience. Perfect place for a romantic dinner,"I took my cousins here after celebrating my nephews 1st birthday the day prior. They live an hour out from SF but I'm always here when I visit. I love the area and the environment. The community is amazing and it's what gives this place 5 stars. Sam was absolutely wonderful and accommodated us no matter how many times we changed our mind on what plates we wanted or how many times I mispronounced """"Al Salmone."""" The staff is friendly and professional", the food is great. I would recommend the Ravioli or Smoked Al Salmone, it's what we had. It was our first time at this establishment but definitely not our last.,Unfortunately," I didn't think it was the """"Best Damn Crab Cioppino"""" as advertised. It was good", but I enjoyed the Rustic Seafood stew at Hog Island more. For 48.95, the portion was decently sized and great for sharing. It was cooked with penne pasta and had a good amount of crab, mussels, shrimp, bay shrimp, and scallops in it. The crab legs were cooked to perfection, but the shrimp wasn't bouncy and tasted a little overcooked with that gritty taste. The tomato broth was leaning towards the watery side so the flavor wasn't 100% . Aside from the Cioppino, I also ordered the Boston Clam Chowder(average),  Sanddab(Flounder), and my friends ordered the Branzino(Bass) and the Rex sole(Flatfish). Fish can be overcooked easily and I am extremely picky with my fish, but I decided to order a fish dish instead of playing it safe with a typical seafood pasta and Sotto Mare had the best damn fish I had ever eaten. The seasoning was great, the fish was juicy and tasted very fresh. I would come back to try more of their fish dishes. With several great restaurants around, it is always busy and parking is terrible. If you don't live in SF, call to make a reservation, call an Uber or expect to pay for parking. Conveniently, there is a lot across the street from Sotto Mare and they charge $30. Don't forget to make a reservation! I made a reservation at 7:30pm on a Friday evening, got seated around 8pm and at 9:15pm, the line was still pretty gnarly. Overall, the fish dishes were delicious, and the Cioppino was decent so it's definitely worth a try. You won't know what the best damn Cioppino is until you have tried several!,We celebrated Mother's Day lunch at Sotto Mare this past weekend. As always the seafood is very fresh! My mom got the clam steamers, my dad got the linguini with clams, and I ordered the seafood linguini. Both clam dishes came with generous portions of clams - my mom was full even though she didn't have pasta in her dish. My seafood linguini was delicious, only critique is that I had a couple clams/mussels and the rest was smaller bits of calamari, baby shrimp, and small scallops. Wish there were some bigger portions of seafood meat.,The wife and I were celebrating our anniversary, and I am a Cioppino lover," so we decided to try Sotto Mare's """"Best Damn  Cioppino"""".  I am not sure if it is the best", cuz I think Scoma's version is pretty damn good, but it was certainly delicious, although the broth is a little on the watery side.  Most impressively, the size was huge.  It came in a large bowl and it was supposed to feed two, but the two of us still couldn't finish it, so for the portion you get it is certainly worth the money.  The Cioppino has all the seafood you would expect like crab, mussels, shrimp, baby scallops, calamari, etc, as well as penne pasta.  The restaurant is busy all day, and they take reservations only for party of 3 or larger.  Even when we got there early on a Saturday at 5pm, we still had to wait about half an hour, but the Cioppino was worth it!,Every time I Googled good restaurants in SF, this place popped up...and it definitely lived up to its name. I arrived for an early dinner at about 5 p.m. so there was no wait and we were seated immediately at the bar.I ordered the Best Damn Crab Cioppino and it fed two people exactly. I can't name all the seafood I saw but there were mussels, large shrimp, baby shrimp, scallops, clams, calamari, and maybe something else. They put a good amount of crab in there so don't fret because you will be getting your money's worth. It also comes with some rigatoni which I think is a tactic for making the bowl look more full because I could have done without it. The hot soup made it cook way past al dente. That said, the complimentary bread they give you is the perfect vehicle for transporting some of that amazing soup into your mouth because you cannot waste any of it! We even got another order because it tasted so good. I definitely recommend stopping by because this place is worth the hype. I wish I can go back to try some of their pasta dishes too because those looked just as tasty.Disclaimer: This review is for 2 months ago. I'm finally recapping my food adventures from my SF trip!,OH MY CODAnother one of those kitschy places in North Beach you check off the bucket list.  IMHO, growing up in SF, I don't frequent North Beach for cioppino.  There's a myriad of restsurants in SF.  I used to get my cioppino fix on at Cioppino's, then again Fisherman's Wharf is another tourist trap.  I'm always down for friends who want to try, and out-of-towners who must go to North Beach.  It's a small tight space at the bar, many of these restaurants are grandfathered in, so they're not super big with added on floors or ADA compliant.  Parking is difficult in this neighborhood.  Gets busy, service is attentive, and corkage fee is decent.  Overall, their cioppino is ai-ight.I came, I dined, I Yelped.  Cheers & see you on Yelp (YELP)!,I used to live in North Beach. Loved this place then and love it now. I finally had the chance to return and introduce a girlfriend - and there is nothing like sitting at the counter, drinking wine, eating cioppino, and just savoring the location, flavors, food ...  Thank you for another great dinner.,Gigi is worth the visit!    Great fish and wine your glass will never be empty?   Gigi can tell a story make you smile try to take your mom home I was the first client after taking a run he said what do you want I said what you would have?   I asked for water he gave me whiteHe was the only person behind the bar restaurant He stayed making the Beat dam cioppino  with everything and crab he was smoking and asked if I wanted a cigarette. I said yes and don't smoke Great food he sold his share but I think still aroundA must in NorthBeach!Great food good times,We made reservations for Mother's Day and had to call a couple of times to be able to make one because they were always so busy! The restaurant is very old school and they don't do reservations online. Also after making reservations we never got a confirmation email or anything so you just have to trust that they will save your slot. Lastly in terms of reservations they don't do parties of 2. They only take reservations for parties of 3 or more so there were a ton of couples and parties of 2 putting their name down when we got to the restaurant and I overheard that their wait was over an hour long.The service was really good despite how busy they were. There were 4 of us and we were going to order 3 pastas, calamari," and a ciopponi and the waitress told us we are probably ordering too much food and we really appreciated her honest feedback so we don't over order. We ended up cutting out one of the pastas and getting only 2 and even then we had a lot of leftovers. The food was good and the price was reasonable. The ciopponi was $50 for two servings and the portion was very big! My only wish was that the fettuccine be a little more flavorful. I recommend getting the linguine with seafood because it was really flavorful and had more seafood in it! The calamari was interesting because it wasn't deep fried as it is at a lot of restaurants. It was boiled so we were a little surprised but it was still good. Overall we had a good experience and would come back but probably won't get the fettuccine and will try to come on a non-holiday because we ended up having to pay $25 for parking because the street is extremely busy and small and there was no parking!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gao Viet Kitchen & Bar,"What can I say? Gao is an experience. The food was great and service was attentive.*Holy pig~ giant crispy and tender pork served with lettuce and noodles to wrap. Cut table side from the chef himself. Must get if you have a large group and want to meet Việt for the gram...*Bo ne~ tender melt in your mouth steak (cooked rare by default) and served with Banh mi (bread) and pate. Yum. Expect to wait it takes long. *Bun mam (not pictured) a funky fermented noodle soup topped with eggplant, squid, fried fish and pork belly. Made for an acquired palate. I loved it ;) *5 spice garlic noodles (not pictured) but this dish speaks for itself. Kids loved it. Chicken leg was tender.*cocktails? I had 2 and they were strong. The Passionfruit pisco is now one of my favorite cocktails. Get it!The restaurant gets very busy and wait times can take long but that's a given due to the huge crowds they have. Be patient they are working hard back there. It's not fast food, it's good food.,They opened a location in SF! It's on the corner of Irving. Parking can get tricky especially on weekend, but food is worth it. Food can get pricey, but once again worth it. The effort put in the dishes shows & the ingredients are fresh. This location is super cute once you walk in. There's a bar to watch games & wait for your table. It can get a bit noisy. Everything on the menu is my favorite and the specials. But my ultimate always that I didn't take a picture of is (idk why) Bo Ne. Can't go wrong with the beef carpaccio and any soup! I love their drinks also. Be patient upon arrival.Shout out to the staff for working this busy crowd. I can't imagine how hectic it is.,We were so excited to try Gao in the city as we loved their spot in South Bay. The food was good but the server we had (Anthony) was absent. He kept on trying to deliver an appetizer that we didn't order. And when we asked about the one that we had ordered, he said ""you still want it?"" We said yes. Then he left asked if we wanted the wrong appetizer which had been sitting on our table-- we said sure as we assumed it was free for all the confusion. He did not say that we would be charged for it and made it seem like it was being given to us for free. At the end of the dinner we asked about one of our main noodles which had not come out at all. He said he would go check on it but he didn't put the order in at all. When we looked at our bill, we saw that we had been charged for the wrong appetizer in addition to the meal. When we asked him about it he said he told us, which was not true. I'm not one to rant or never give a full tip but super bummed about the service. Hopefully they'll work out the issues.,I think I've located a new Pho  spot that I'm going to frequent. Thank you fellow Yelpers for your guidance. Always. I love the spaciousness and the open space concept, high ceilings, modern, and casual vibe without feeling 'stuffy.'Great friendly and efficient service. The Pho is delicious! The beef bone and beef marrow broth is piping hot, flavorful, rich, with such depth. The noodles are fresh, al dente and silky smooth. The filet mignon are thinly sliced and oh so tender.We loved everything, including the cocktails. Yes, they have a full bar! Bonus!-Marrow cracker - crispy coconut sticky rice, topped with marrow and pork belly. Crispy melt in your mouth deliciousness.-Chubby Pho (as described above) -Wok Pho (also as described above) -Shaking beef - chunks of tender filet wok tossed to perfection, and served with tasty garlic noodles. Thank you Chefs, kitchen staff, and service team.Looking forward to seeing y'all again!,I've heard so many great things about this place and so we came to try it as a family.We ordered the mixed platter (4 items), banh ceo, chubby pho and shaking beef.Pros:The quality of the meat is definitely good. Even in the pho, you can taste the meat quality.The decor inside looks very nice, does make me feel like I was in Vietnam.Portions are largePlenty of smiles from service staff.Cons:The chubby noodle broth was way too oily and it did not come out hot. The soup was barely warm.The shaking beef didn't have that much flavorThe price is pretty expensive for Vietnamese food.The service is good but probably because they don't have their own tables designated, they don't communicate with each other and you get interrupted a lot. For example, three people in the span of two minutes came to try to take the same two plates away and we had to tell all of them that we were still working on it.,Amazing.  My best friends and I had dinner here and it was so good They don't take reservations so come early and put your name on the list.We went on a busy Saturday night and my friend arrived at 7:15 pm to put us on the list for a table for 4.  We waited at the bar and was seated around 8:10 pm.  Everyone at the bar was super sweet and friendly. We were seated on their second level and took a quick look at their menu. We ordered the following:  Cha Gio (Cripy Imperial rolls)Marrow cracker ( Crispy coconut sticky rice & pork belly, MARROW, grilled & spring onion, drops of au jus sauce of love) Lemongrass tofu Banh Beo (Savory Steamed Rice Cake, Shrimp Flake, Fried Shallot, Green Onion)  Pork RibGarlic Noodle 3-way (Grilled Ribeye, Grilled Shrimps, Imperial Rolls, Garlic Noodle, Fresh Mixed Vegetable) Big Gao Pho (Big Beef Short Rib, *Filet Mignon, Marrow, Onion, 24-Hour Marrow Broth) Everything we ordered was delicious.  My faves were the Garlic noodle 3-way and the Big Gao Pho.  Definitely returning and brining my husband and kids with me.  Highly recommend!,Watched this place prep for months and so excited that I finally got to try out their food! I have not been to the San Mateo location so Gao Viet Kitchen & Bar is all new to me. I wasn't sure what to expect except for The Phozilla. Got here around 5pm on Sunday and luckily there was still some tables. Got seated immediately. One thing to note throughout the service is I definitely think the servers know people take food pics because they are so prepared for the mishaps of fallen chopsticks or spilled sauces. Amazing service throughout (even though I heard them asking for more assistance upstairs). Ordered: 1. Pho Roll 2. Marrow Cracker 3. Bánh Bèo 4. Oc Huong 5. The Phozilla 6. The Big BBH 7. Bo Ne First--I had a table of 8 and we knew what we (thought) we were getting into with The Phozilla. It's supposed to be about 3 regular bowls/portions of pho but with our table of 8, I think if we just ordered that we would have been fine. It's A LOT. My favorite small eats of the night was the marrow cracker. I loved the crispy coconut sticky rice on the bottom with the super soft pork belly & marrow. Super delicious and I know that the menu said it takes longer but that was the first starter that arrived at our table. I also really loved the snails! These were really large snails with a lot of meat inside the shell so I was pleasantly surprised. The Bo Ne was a really hearty dish. It hits all the notes of a full English breakfast except with a Vietnamese twist. Instead of bread we substituted with rice. Throughout this meal though and looking through the menu I will say...that if you are a vegetarian/vegan that there are not a lot of options for you. Every dish is very meat and/or seafood forward. The broth for the pho is also very rich and fatty so it's definitely not a place I would go regularly but probably a place I would bring friends visiting from out of town or maybe a special occasion. Ambiance was really warm and inviting. I loved all the colorful decor on the wall leading up the stairs to the second floor. So glad they took over this spot in Sunset.,Came here on Sunday night at around 8:30pm. No line, no waiting. We were greeted warmly, and seated right away. This place is huge with additional upstairs seating. They also have a full bar with many delicious cocktails.  This is our first time here, a friend recommended the Gao Viet in San Mateo, so when we found out they opened one in Irving, we were excited to try it out. They are currently soft opening, so their menu is limited. We ordered and our food came out quickly.We ordered:Imperial rollsBanh CuonBig Gao Pho Coconut coffee We love anything with beef rib, so the big gao pho was delightful. The beef rib was tender and juicy, the marrow broth was rich and very flavorful. The portions were large and made for quite a feast. We took the beef home because it was a lot of food for us. Everything we ordered was delicious and we will come back to try more food when they grand open for their full menu. The service was great. Servers were attentive, pleasant and helpful. Our overall experience was good. It's pricey but worth trying. Highly recommend and will definitely come back.,Tried the Gao in SM 2 weeks ago, then decided to try the SF location since it's closer to home and it's always nice to have a comparison. The waitlist process is the same as the Gao in SM - no resy, you show up and enter your info on their tablet. However, the wait times here are incredibly fast! We waited 10 mins max. Was able to stop by the bar for a quick drink while we waited for our table. This location is definitely bigger than the SM location, with an upstairs area too. If you don't want to wait, you can actually eat at the bar top. We ordered the banh beo, pork belly, marrow cracker, BBH and a sizzling plate (forgot the name). I think our server regretted giving us a smaller table once she realized how much food the both of us ordered lol. Items came out fast and flavor and quality for everything was really good. My favorite was the banh beo and pork belly. I have to say, I don't know of any other viet restaurant in the area that has banh beo, so I'm very happy Gao offers it! Prices are on the higher side yes, but the experience is great. I loved that the food was more elevated and this would make it a great place for a casual date or something a little extra for dinner.,There was so much hype surrounding gao viet kitchen & bar that i just had to try. Came in on a weekday night with like a party of 9 and we got seated pretty quickly. Had high expectations but i'm going to be brutally honest, it was a let down. The service was really good, everyone was nice and all. We ordered drinks and food and of course drinks came first, great! The drinks were not bad, i was expecting more from a coconut viet coffee, but it wasn't bad. The espresso martini was pretty good, everything else was kind of standard. We waited about 20 minutes for the first plate to come out which was the sizzling hot plate, and then our appetizer came out after and then the shaking beef with garlic noodle. Then we waited towards the me of finishing all of those another 40 minutes for our pho to come out... Pretty disappointing. The Bo Ne, sizzling plate with the filet mignon was so bland. Had zero seasoning to it. The only thing that made the dish taste good was fried egg and sweet sausage. How was there no flavor in the filet mignon?! This is $36 for this sizzling plate, pretty disappointing since we were all kind of looking forward to this. Also ordered the banh hoi with the assorted vietnamese meats and crispy pork was not bad. The vietnamese grilled pork sausage and the sugarcane shrimp were great. The shaking beef was so sad. Again, beef with no flavor. It had good texture and was cooked well. But there was no flavor to it. The garlic noodles that we added had no hints of garlic to it and was also bland. The big gao pho was good. It had a great rich flavor The meat portion on it was great too, but i wouldn't pay $33 for this. It was good but it wasn't spectacular. The soft shell crab bun rieu was nice. Good flavor of crab and tomato soup. It was really good, except the fact that there was barely any crab in the actual soup... Again $28 for this, it's alright.Do i regret coming ? Of course not, Im glad i got to try a lot of different dishes, and it may have just been an off day for them. But based on my experience I might not come back, everything was just alright for what you're paying for. Service was great though!,Ok this place may actually be worth the hype. They're still soft opening so the menu is limited but still some very enticing choices for you to try!Our orders:BIG GAO PHO (filet mignon and beef rib) - intense broth, super intense beef rib. It's a HEARTY portion and we could barely get thru 1/4 of the beef rib, took that home for another meal. Overshadowed the filet mignon, which I'm sure normally on their own is great. Really enjoyed the flat noodles. I'm usually a big fan of the herbs that come with pho so bummed that's not served here to balance the bowl out. It's a bit too rich for me. SOFT SHELL CRAB BANH CANH - rich lobster broth still but more my speed than the beef broth. Soft shell crab was great texturally, pork belly was fattier than I'd like (couldn't eat most of it) but comes with the territory of pork belly. I personally loved the thick noodles here.ESPRESSO MARTINI - my friend ordered one and it was shockingly good with the Vietnamese coffee, not too sweet! Would be happy to come try more cocktails here!They were out of the marrow crackers but wanted to try that as well. It's an extremely rich meal I'd have to plan for, but would come back for sure. The main dishes run $22-$33 approx, which is significantly higher than the average in the area (Kevin's or PPQ across the street sling bowls of pho for $13 or so) but you're getting a bright new restaurant with cocktails, filet mignon, and massive portions of beef rib or soft shell crab. It's worth it. The decor is beautiful and the service was friendly. Took awhile to get our food, and maybe 40 mins to get seated even though there were empty tables (5 ppl on a rainy Sat at 6pm), but think we could have just sat immediately at the bar where we waited anyway. May improve as they staff up, they're still soft opening. There's a Yelp waitlist at the door (but not in advance on app yet), and I think most people walk across the street to get some Pineapple King as they wait..,We came here on a Friday night around 9:30pm and it was packed! The interior is huge and with upstairs seating we only waited a short while to be seated.We decided to share everything and ordered two starters and three entrees. We got the pho rolls and beef carpaccio and both were delicious. The pho rolls were warm and packed with meat and veggies, a fun take on a spring roll. The beef carpaccio was so flavorful and the beef was ridiculously tender. The entrees we shared were the big gao pho, the big bbh, and the 5 spice chicken garlic noodle. Both of the phos were wonderful, the soups had a rich flavor and the meat was fall off the bone. The 5 spice chicken with garlic noodles was good but could have been more spicy in my opinion. The service was great and all of the servers we had were very attentive and helpful. Overall it was a great experience and although this restaurant is definitely more on the pricey side, I'd say it's worth trying!,I'm so glad this location opened!! Been on the hunt for the best Vietnamese food in the city :)Drinks: ALL 10/10 SO GOOD I wish this was closer to me I would come by and get these drinks to go. The coconut slush in the coffee and lychee drinks added a refreshing creamy taste and kept the drink tasting great as it melted. The sugarcane juice also hit the spot!Pork Belly: 10/10 Great to share with the table. The skin was crispy and meat was so tender! If they had more noodles to go with it the proportions would be perfect.Clay Pot: 9/10 So yummy but was slightly overcooked- the sauce was pretty salty and the fish a little dry. But the overall flavor and portion size was great!Five spice chicken: 10/10 So yom!! The chicken went amazing with the garlic noodles.Five spice pho: 11/10 Only thing better than the garlic noodle chicken is the chicken pho!!! I will say this isn't the usual pho flavor I am used to but the noodle soup is still delicious.,Gao SF on Irving is finally open!! The best viet food just got a little bit closer to the city. They are currently soft opening right now and it's as busy as ever (for good reason). When you walk inside you're greeted with warm energy and two stories of seating. There's also a full bar for plenty of delicious cocktails but my fav is the lychee coconut freeze (non-alcoholic). Now let's dive into the food: Cha Gio (Crispy Imperial Rolls) - crispy with plenty of herbs on the side for the perfect appetizer.Bo Tai Chanh (Beef Carpaccio) - this is a must for me! It's refreshing, flavorful and absolutely delicious. Banh Khot - crispy, savory mini pancakes topped with shrimp and eaten with herbs. If you haven't had this before, I highly recommend. Marrow Cracker - crispy, decadent and topped with pork belly. If you've never had bone marrow this is a good way to give it a taste test. Mussels - sizzling and topped with scallions and peanuts, truly a street food that I can't enough of. Pork Rib - my favorite dish and go to order. This plate is big! Sticky char grilled ribs with crispy coconut sticky rice. I always crave this dish. Can't wait for them to grand open with their full menu!,Pho is so comforting on a cold winter day, and I'm glad my friend was pestering us to come here. And I'm glad it wasn't raining when we were all waiting outside for a table to open! I got the wok pho, and the broth was so rich and beefy! It was amazing. It had filet mignon and flat rice noodles. It was so delicious!! I wish it came with the traditional accompaniments, though. I missed the bean sprouts :( Our food also took a long time to come out. I also got the calamansi sugar cane juice, and it was so good!,4.5 STARS GLOW UP! From humble, hole-in-the-wall beginnings in SSF with $7-$8 Phở served in a cramped dining area to a viral $95 Phởzilla served in a modern and spacious bi-level restaurant space...That people wait hours in line for. I mean, hey...if you make Tech, TikTok, YouTube, or OnlyFans monies, DO IT! The rest of us will just scratch and sniff your pics and clips. The owner(s) of Ben Tre have come a long way from their SSF days and now they've opened their second location of their wildly popular Gao Viet Kitchen at the former KFC in the city. They're open for takeout and indoor dining. No outdoor dining.Walk-in only, no rezzies. Join the yelp waitlist when you arrive (available before opening). 90 minute limit per table. M E N UElevated regional Viet cuisine with modern twists: starters, street snacks, entrees, noodle soups, and desserts. QR code; no physical menus. What makes Gao special, is they have items that you normally have to travel to E Man Jose for like Bánh Bèo (water fern cakes), Bánh Khọt (mini savory pancakes), Bánh Cuốn (steamed rice noodle rolls), Ốc (snails), Bò Né (steak & eggs), Bún Mắm (viet gumbo), etc. You may find one or two of these items at Bạc Liêu, Bodega, or Lily in the city but Gao has them all.And, of course, they have over the top dishes like the $95 Phởzilla w/ a whole maine lobster and giant beef bone rib that you can't find anywhere else...for now. Full bar. F O O D* Bánh Bèo: Savory Steamed Rice Cake w/ shrimp flakes, fried shallot, green onion (7 pc - $19): tinyurl.com/33he637tThe water fern cakes were dense with a firm panna cotta-like texture (I prefer a smoother more delicate texture). Coconutty with the shrimp flakes and fried shallots adding umami and a crispy textural contrast. Kinda miss the usual pork rinds tho. Gotta have that fragrant mở hành (scallion oil) and nước chấm (fish dipping sauce) for punch of flavor and funk.  Ask for a side of chili peppers if you like your nước chấm spicy. Now those who live in the city can satisfy their bánh bèo cravings without having to drive down to San Mateo (Gao's other location) or further down to E Man Jose. * Bò Né: Sizzling Filet Mignon Steak & Double Running Egg w/ sweet sausage, pâté, vietnamese ham, onion, tomatoes, bread ($36): tinyurl.com/bddm3esf***Chef's choice on temperature; medium rare. The price may sound steep esp when comparing it to Bò Né Phú Yên in Lion Plaza (ifykyk) but it's a large portion, enough for two to share if you order an extra baguette. The oyster sauce+soy marinated filet mignon was so soft, tender, and flavorful...with the rich and creamy pâté taking it to the next level. If there wasn't enough meat, there's also a side of sweet chinese sausage and seared viet ham (steamed pork roll). Tear a piece of the warm crusty, airy soft baguette, smear some pâté on, then drag it through farm - the runny eggs and buttery meat juices...BOMB! If you've never had Viet steak & eggs, I highly recommend trying it. IMO, it trumps the American version on any day. S E R V I C EFor soft opening week to the public, the friendly staff did a good job making their rounds and checking in to make sure everything is ok...including the cheerful owner, Viet. For 4 pm dinner service, food arrived within 15 minutes (yes, I eat like a senior). A M B I A N C EContemporary, casual elegance; main dining area and mezzanine with a separate bar area w/ TVs. P A R K I N GVery challenging street parking. On the weekends, give yourself at least an extra 15-20 minutes to find parking if you're meeting people up. Overall, glad to see this family-owned and operated business GLOW UP and become so successful in the SF Peninsula area. If you're looking for elevated Viet cuisine with a modern spin and legit flavors, Gao is it!,The food here is very tasty, but I'm not sure it is worth the price. Disclaimer: my friend and I went here for the soft opening, so I kept my expectations low for service. I know San Mateo always has a crazy long wait, so I wanted to try the new location before word got out. We got here at 5:30 on a Thursday and were seated right away. Our server took our appetizer order because we were still deciding on 1 entree or 2. We ordered 2 appetizers, they came out almost immediately. But then it went downhill from there.We never saw our server again...(except he seemed to start helping upstairs tables).The appetizers were good. It's been a week now, so I forget the name of the sampler one. But the rice noodle roll was lacking flavor. The sausage was tasty though. The bone marrow crackers were good but not good enough for me to buy again.After apps, I went outside to make a phone call. My friend was able to grab a different server, and she ordered the big bbh (the spicy beef pho with a big rib). It didn't arrive at our table for 90 minutes. The reason I know this is because my phone call was at 6:30, and I checked the time when the soup came out...8 o'clock.We ""dined"" here for 3 hours. And we only ordered 3 things. Lucky for us, we started so early, we didn't have plans later that got ruined. While we waited, they brought us a complimentary five spice chicken pho. The chicken was cold (but tasted good and was good reheated the next day), but the soup wasn't special. I appreciate the free dish because we got to try something extra, but the mood was kind of ruined because when the soup finally came, it was underwhelming and we were too full to enjoy much of it. The leftovers we took home were good the next day though, so at least we got to enjoy it eventually. Also, the restaurant said they ran out of the thick round noodles in bbh and asked us for a substitute. But then the soup came out with the correct noodles. So idk if that was an excuse for some other delay, but who knows?Technically I'd give this place 3.5 stars, but the food is good enough to leave 4 for now. If the service was faster, I'd come back. I'll let them work the kinks out first. And I would only come here for special occasions because it's pricy for what it is.,This place had great service and ambiance. The tastiness of the dishes varied but were great overall. I would come back again to try the other dishes, and would recommend it to others as a fun place to try because of its creative menu and super aesthetic food presentation. We went on a Friday around 7, and waited about a hour before getting seated. There was still a line up until closing time. Marrow Cracker was ok. The marrow didn't have too much flavor, and the rice on the bottom was kind of chewy and hard to bite. I wouldn't get this one again. Bao Ne was pretty flavorful and what I expected it would taste like, nothing surprising -- the steak was tender, and the other meats were good too. This one took about 40 minutes to come out. I wouldn't get it again for myself, but I think it's a solid thing to try when you're there for the first time. Soft Shell Crab Bun Rieu was DELICIOUS. The meatballs and the soup were really flavorful, and the tomato balanced out the richness well. I would get this dish again.,How can you not be a fan of Gao Viet? I was so happy to hear that Gao Viet was opening up a new location in SF. Patiently waited for its arrival and yes we can have some authentic Vietnamese food. If you're a fan of Ben Tre then look no further. My friends and I had dinner here last week. We can right when they opened. They have plenty of seatings and a spacious dinning room. The decor resembles the one in San Mateo too, but 10x bigger in size. What we ordered:Chubby pho noodleShaken beef with garlic noodlesImperial rolls Nem nuong rolls All dishes were delicious, flavorful, and presentation was there. The shaken beef dish was huge and we ended taken the left overs home. The carvings of meat in the pho were tender and melted in your mouth. I will be back to try their other noodle soups. Thank you Gao Viet for always dishing out pho-nominal foods!,We've heard this restaurant based off Instagram popularity and maybe other social media resources (that I'm not on) we tried the prawns, 5 spice pork belly, banh beo and the steak dish. All I can say is that the place is overhyped and over priced for what's being served. Nothing wasn't pleasant, but it felt like it was based off more of presentation than flavor. Nice place to check out for aesthetics but I believe the food can be better. The pork belly tasted as if it was just seasoned with the five spice packet, something you can do at home. It was cooked good though! The prawns were probably the best out of all, but it was so overpriced for one. The steak could of definitely had some more flavor, like salt or just any flavoring. The banh beo was way too coconut flavor. I'm used to not tasting coconut so maybe it's their style? But not mine.,I came here a couple of days ago with my brother and sister-in-law. We had great food and a great time! I loved the atmosphere; the vibes were cozy and it was very comfortable to move around. I love the meat and pho; it was the best.I've been here a few times and still love coming back!,Glad to be able to try this place out and got everything that interested my eye. My party got the beef pho, soft shelled crab bun rieu, beef carpaccio, and bo ne. We ordered by QR code since they don't have physical menus, but it only linked us to their main website where we had to scroll through the right links to find what we wanted to order. I think that's one area that could use improving. Overall everything came out fast and food was tasty. Pho tasted pure and their homemade sriracha sauce was really flavorful and spicy. The beef carpaccio was very cold though,  it was as of it was just defrosted. So besides the onions I really didn't taste anything. The bo ne was ok,  I thought the beef tasted a bit like liver. The best dish was the soft shelled crab bun rieu. I didn't care for the soft shelled crab but the crab balls were super flavorful. If I were to go again I'd like to just sub the soft shelled crab for extra crab balls. Prices are fair for how high end they're making the place,  and there's plenty of options nearby if you're looking for something cheaper but just as good.,I guess we were lucky to be here on a rainy Sunday night. Parking was less than a minute walk, wait time was less than ten minutes. Had the sweetest waitress with the most genuine smile and personality. Such a wonderful dining experience,I've been wanting to try Gao Viet for a long time, given all the social media hype. Came for dinner on a Thursday night and was able to get seated immediately. It's a rather larger restaurant but I was pleasantly surprised with how quickly the food came out. Ordered the pho shots (with tequila), marrow cracker, banh beo, bo ne, and sugar cane juice. The pho broth was out of this world. Such a rich, herby, and flavorful broth. Gotta be one of the best broths I've ever had. I didn't really enjoy the sugar cane juice and the marrow cracker. The pork belly was a bit too tough to eat but the flavor wasn't bad. Highlight of the meal was the banh beo and bo ne. Both were fantastic. The steak in the bo ne was so tender and juicy. Literally melts in your mouth and cooked to absolute perfection. So many other dishes I would be interested in trying next time and will be back!,I recently dined at Gao, and was blown away by the service I received from Liz. From the moment I walked in the door, she made me feel welcome and ensured that my experience was top-notch.The food was absolutely delicious, with a wide variety of traditional Vietnamese dishes to choose from. But it was Liz's attention to detail and friendly demeanor that truly made the meal special. She was always prompt and made great recommendations based on my preferences.Overall, I give Gao and Liz a solid five stars. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for delicious food and exceptional service. Thank you, Liz, for making my dining experience so memorable!,-1 stars wait time (on a Wednesday night, 30 minutes for a table, 45 minutes for the first dish, 1.5 hours from sit down to finishing dinner)-2 stars for the lady serving my pho with her ENTIRE THUMB inside the soupFood was good but expensive as hell, and wait times don't help at all. The servers are really kind and have great attitudes but they tend to hover by the kitchen and leave tables unattended for long periods of time. The food takes forever to come so expect to spend at 2+ hours here on less busy nights. I'll try again in a year maybe.,While walking on Irving street, the TV's inside the restaurant caught my eye. Then I realize this is the new Gao Viet location Cherylynn N. (a Yelp All-Star Legend) yelped about last week. I didn't know about this location until reading about it on Cherylynn N.'s feed. I abandoned my dinner plans down the block and decided to have dinner here. No wait on a Monday night at 6pm. Having ate at all the other Ben Tre/Gao Viet locations, I know their menu well. I got the Big Gao pho (beef rib) $33. This was delicious! The broth was spot on. The beef rib was generous. I ate much smaller ones at their other location. This time I got lucky with a big rib. Be sure to ask for scissors as eating that rib off the bone is not easy. Filet Mignon is used for the beef slices. It is a soft cut. Chewy and not flavorful. As for the bánh cuốn, minced pork rice roll, sausage and ham dish. This was fine. It tasted fresh with the shredded cucumber, lettuce and  mint leaves. Service was excellent. Good job everyone at Gao Viet.  Pro tips: - Sit by the kitchen and you will see some tasty dishes rolling out.- Your main dish will come out before your appetizers. - Full bar with TV's on the right side.- There's an upstairs.,Not your mom's viet restaurant. This is for my 25+ year olds that want to take a shot of henny with their pho. Or for my 21 year old influencers who want to record themselves trying the $100 pho challenge Or for the 30+ year olds that live in sf bc they work in tech/finance but miss delicious tasting, legit viet food. Especially that hue food, IYKYK!Pro tip, you can skip a wait by eating at the bar, not have to stare at your spouse's face the entire meal, and enjoy good company from your bartender, heyyyyy,Boss man on the bike with my dinner *Thank you player !I will pullup again very soon. I have unfinished business to do here ( more dishes to try ). See y'all soon !*that wasn't my dinner,One of my fav Viet spots in the bay opened their long-anticipated location in SF, and it did not disappoint! Even though the wait seemed long when we arrived, we put our names on the list and grabbed a tasty cocktail at the bar to pass the time. 20 min later we were seated and our friends arrived, perfect timing for me to finally try the Bo Ne after sampling a bunch of soups and other starters at their San Mateo location previously. What it lacks in authenticity, it more than makes up for in flavor and portion size.,I knew I had to check this place ou",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 during my bday week after having an amazing meal down at their San Mateo location. I loved it so much, i went twice in one week! I had so many amazing dishes cause my mother is from Saigon and we have to try everything ! The Saigon Bliss cocktail was yummy and sweet. Marrow cracker was different but delicious. The Bo Ne was a smorgasbord of food... delicious filet mignon, yummy sausage and other meats. We also had the banh khot (mini crepe with shrimp). Oh man, so good.I also had the soft shell crab bun rieu later that week. So yummy! And we had the 5 spice pork belly. I will definitely come back and try out the other dishes... maybe even the pho zilla one day...,My friends and I came to their soft opening day. It was really busy, but everyone was really kind and made sure we had a great time. Anything you order will surely be a hit, but if you want a bit of direction, here's what we ordered:- Sugarcane Juice: refreshing, not too sweet, compliments your meal well- Marrow Cracker: YUM. The coconut sticky rice compliments the pork belly and marrow very well. - Pho Shot: pho broth poured into a shot glass to chase your Suntory Toki Whisky shot. What an experience! - Chubby Pho: The name is so great! Like I mentioned before, there's marrow in almost everything! - Garlic Noodle 3-Way: Seasoned well and very garlicky (which is a given). - Chef Choice Platter: A great dish to order if you want to try a little bit of every roll before committing to one.- Banh Khot: one of my favorites. Super flavorful teeny bites!Lemme just say that there's marrow in almost everything. Motto of our night: don't waste the marrow! We loved everything we ordered, but our personal favorites were the sugarcane juice, marrow cracker and the banh khot!Can't wait to go back and try more dishes!,I was here a couple of weeks ago for a post-holiday party with some coworkers. It was a Rainy Thursday evening. I appreciated how quickly we were seated (it was a group of 8 of us). I was surprised since the San Mateo location is busy (I recommend trying the San Mateo location). The service was good, and our waiter was attentive. On the downside, they were short shrimp that day, if I recall. Also, the cocktail menu was not as extensive as the San Mateo location. But the food was delicious, and the portions were extremely generous. I would come back and try more food (especially the Pho). Please note that the food is pricier (not a deal breaker but an FYI).,Went to Gao for the first time this past weekend and we had such an enjoyable meal/experience! We started off with some cocktails by Tommy from the bar, which all were amazing and tasted really good! I had the espresso martini which was done so well because it was so creamy, which I enjoy! Tommy was also able to accommodate my friend's sweet tooth and made him a really nice cocktail with the sugar cane juice!!We started off with the pho rolls and the pork belly - both were quite tasty, though I don't think they're must orders.The main stars were the chubby pho and pork ribs!! The broth in the chubby pho was so flavorful, we couldn't stop eating it!!! And the pork ribs were so tender! Their menu is massive and we really had a hard time deciding what to order, so we'll definitely come back soon!The service and the ambiance were both fun and amazing! I'll definitely be back soon!,Wow, I had no idea a new establishment took over the old KFC building on 22nd and Irving. I'm glad I encountered their soft opening today because this place will be hard to get in for a while.I was walking back home when I saw this place opened and decided to check out out. I arrived just 15 mins after they opened and the restaurant was already 2/3s full. Luckily, I was able to get seated right away.I've never been to the San Mateo location so I had no idea what to expect. Deciding what to get was tough because their menu had pictures of all their food items and they all looked so amazingly delectable! I did notice the menu for the SF location is a bit limited compared to the San Mateo location (soft opening, makes sense) and a little bit pricier too. I decided to try the banh cuon ($19) and coconut coffee ($8.50). The banh cuon was so delicious! The portion is decently sized for sharing and a full meal if you are eating it alone. You get 5 rolls of banh cuon, 4 half slices of the Vietnamese ham, and 2 pieces of the nem nuong wrapped around sugarcane. The vegetables on the plate was equivalent to a plate of salad and had fresh cucumber, bean sprouts, and lettuce. The coconut coffee was so good! I kept getting brain freeze because I was drinking it so quickly but it was just that good! I love coffee to begin with so this was a no brainer drink to try. There were other drinks on the menu like lychee coconut and passionfruit coconut that I want to try next time. They also have this pho shot that seems fun to try with friends. I'm glad this restaurant opened here. It's definitely a great addition to the sunset district.,Contemporary Vietnamese food at a steep price. We ordered the pho with short rib and bun rieu for main dishes. Appetizers were marrow crackers and beef carpaccio. Plus some drinks. Personally I felt the pho soup was heavy. You can see the fat pool at the top. It's packed, which is great for quantity; but too much at the point it didn't feel like a soup. It's made with flat noodles which I prefer.Bun rieu had a strange taste, sort of a acidic bitterness to it? Not my cup of tea. I'll stick with the traditional bun rieu. Similar to the pho; it's jam packed.The appetizers and drinks were the best part of the meal. Crackers def worth it it. Tender, subtle saltiness. Beef carpaccio thin and dressed well. It also was a large dish, easily can be shared amongst 3 people.  Drinks was the Saigon bliss and hao?? Something. Strong and not overly flavored with the components. Worth it.,OMG.... Food is amazing including the dinks Holy Gao. My family and I have a wonderful time. Next time we leaving the kids lol,5 stars for service, very attentive I give 4 stars for food because I really don't know how Vietnamese food supposed to taste like, so far is ok, food more on sweet side and nothing spicy,Came here on a Friday around 5:30pm and got seated immediately. The main dining room was full so they sat us upstairs. Was kinda disappointed since the ambiance looked nicer downstairs, and it was just super plain up top with nothing to look at. Music is good and the service here is awesome! The older gentleman who works upstairs was very nice and attentive. The presentation of the food is aesthetically pleasing, but as for the taste, it was really average. The pho roll was so plain I couldn't even taste the ribeye that was in it. It felt like the beef was non existent in my mouth lol. All I could taste was the pho noodle sheet. The marrow cracker was super basic (don't get this, it sounds better than it is). The nem nuon roll was the best thing here. I wish I would've ordered more of that versus the other appetizers that I got. The banh khot was ok and the banh cuon was decent. I feel like the fish sauce that they use here is so light like you can't even taste it. Like is there even fish in the sauce? I hope that makes sense. I even brought my mom here and she was not impressed especially since she's Vietnamese and I agree with her that these dishes were lacking authenticity in their flavors. I think this place definitely appeals to the younger crowd and if you truly know what these dishes normally taste like you would understand where I'm coming from. I did enjoy the drinks that we got - the espresso martini was good and so was the sugar cane juice. Also, just a heads up your hair and clothes are gonna smell after eating here since there's no air ventilation. Overall, I wouldn't be coming back here.,I came here on the soft opening date and the restaurant was super full! Service was nice and we didn't have to wait too long for our food. We tried the Chubby pho, beef carpaccio, nem rolls, and the shaking beef with garlic noodles. Everything tasted fresh and the portions were reasonable. The menu prices are a little more expensive but typical for SF. Overall this is a solid Vietnamese restaurant geared towards Instagram-worthy dishes!,Absolutely love that they are a lot closer to me now. The portions are great. The service is excellent. The food is exceptional. The broth is so good. Every time I have been there the ambience has been quite lively. Definitely a place to go with a group of friends. Make reservations otherwise you will be waiting a while.,We came on a rainy Sunday night and was still pretty busy. We waited about 30 minutes for our group of 5. While waiting, there is a bar to sit and have a drink. Our name was on a Yelp waitlist so could also leave and be notified. Between our table we ordered the soft shell crab banh canh and big gao pho. Both were so good. I liked the big gao a bit better because I typically get beef but the crab was different and wanted to try something new. The broths were both rich and tasty. The meat, veggies, and noodles were filling and portions were huge. The meat was really tender, noodles a good chew, and all was cooked perfectly. We wanted to try the marrow crackers but they didn't have anymore left. Might have to come back for another bowl and marrow crackers sometime but it's definitely more of a novelty spot and not my everyday. The inside of the restaurant was really cute and loved the colorful decor.,We ordered the Bo Ne and The Big Gao Pho.. both of these did not miss. 11/10 would order the same exact thing again. As we were waiting in line, all the waiters had the sizzling Bo Ne in their hand as they were distributing it all the tables. That is when we knew we had to try. The Big Gao Pho also had a very generous amount of meat. Definitely coming back soon,Finally tried this place in the city; similar to Sam Mateo, fresh ingredients and quality flavor,Finally after waiting for this place to open. It's not the hype, but damn that was f@cking delicious! The filet mignon was so garlicy - love love  love it! No room to try everything today. Get here now before the lines form.,This was my first visit to Gao and not my last. I have always wanted to try this restaurant in San Mateo and I'm glad they opened one in SF. My party basically ordered everything on their menu and it was delicious. My favorite was the BÚN BÒ HUẾ, MARROW CRACKER, and BO NE. Shout out to our waitress Liz as she kept her cool as the restaurant was extremely busy this past Saturday night. She made sure we got what we needed and checked in several times as we waited for our food. My last thoughts are that good things are worth waiting for!If you want a happy tummy, go to Gao!,Not only is the Gao in San Mateo amazing, they opened another location that has perfectly replicated the flavors of what makes this restaurant a stand out! I would compare Gao's food concept similar to Farmhouse Thai, where both have managed to add bells and whistles that not only create opportunities for those Instagram pics, but elevates the flavors to something new yet familiar. Quick Summary: 1. Food - The food is amazing, and as generic it is to say that, you just need to eat it to believe it. Everything is fresh, portions are large, and the taste is so good that you'll already be planning your next trip back. 2. Ambience - The restaurant is well lit and had a lot of positive energy; Gao did a good job with renovating the previous KFC to create a modern dining environment. 3. Service - All the staff were extremely friendly! 4. Drinks - The Thai Milk Tea and the Coconut Coffee were fun to drink; would recommend but not game changers. Conclusion:If you've never been to Gao, I'm telling you that the 30 min to 1 hour wait is worth it. Gao takes familiar Vietnamese dishes and accentuates them to give them a modern twist while paying homage to the originals. Detailed Perspective:1. Food - I've eaten at the Gao in San Mateo, and from I can tell, the quality is held to the same high standard! All the ingredients are fresh, the dishes are extremely presentable and look vibrant, and there is no such thing as a dull bite. All the rice noodles and sheets were fresh, silky, bouncy, and had a great bite. The quality of the food was not compromised by the large portions either; there's enough to fill your belly and to eat at lunch the next day. I could go on about each dish, but Gao has taken the classic Vietnamese dishes that we've known and loved and elevated them to a higher tier. 2. Ambience - Gao managed to transform this space into a setting that integrates well into their superb food and fun atmosphere. The table configuration is such that customers don't feel too cramped and have their own space to converse and eat. The acoustics are also very good; the hustle and bustle of the restaurant does not dampen any isolated conversations. 3. Service - We have a hunch that Gao had some of their staff from their other locations to help manage the business and mentor the newer staff; if so, this explains how Gao has had an amazing start at this new location. The staff are very friendly, and very attentive to your needs! 4. Drinks - I've had drinks at the other Gao location in San Mateo, and though I don't think that the high quality has changed, I wouldn't say that the drinks should be the main draw for why you come to Gao. Nevertheless, be sure to grab one, alcoholic or not as you embark on this amazing food adventure!,For what it's worth, I think the San Francisco location is much better than the San Mateo location. The food came out hotter and the service was much quicker. However, similar to the San Mateo location, the soups lack the traditional Vietnamese feel. To me, the Gao bowl is no different than a simple brisket soup and the Bun Rieu just had an overwhelming taste of tomato and no depth. The Nem in the Nem roll was very small but to my surprise, I thoroughly enjoyed the pho roll and would be interested in eating it again.,"if """"umami"""" had an address this would be it. just put bone marrow on anything you order and you would leave with a food coma.",Yay that Gao finally came to SF! This location is definitely bigger than the San Mateo one and for the two times I went so far, we didn't have to wait. I think if you get in before 6pm, there shouldn't be a wait or it's minimal. Our favorite items were definitely the Chubby Pho and the Coconut Coffee which was a slushy coffee and not too sweet and was a compliment to some of the spicier items. Definitely a treat yourself type of Vietnamese spot. I'd definitely go again but it's hard to give 5 stars when there are other practical, affordable Viet spots nearby like Kevin's where you can get 2 pho bowls for the price of 1 here, and Perilla.,So excited that Gao is finally in SF! No more having to commute to San Mateo and waiting 3 hours for a table. This location is way bigger and more inviting. I think their menu choices are different than the San Mateo location since there were some items that I couldn't find. My table got the banh beo, banh hoi platter, BBH, and bun cha. Their dishes were great except for the BBH which I thought was lacking in spice. Would definitely come back whenever I have large parties as the menu is mainly catered to family-style dining. Residential parking might be tough but  worth if you want other vietnamese dishes besides noodle soups and sandwiches,I tried this place the other day and in my honest opinion, I was not really impressed. Being Vietnamese I know what to look for when it comes to real Vietnamese food and this place didn't really cut it for me. We ordered nuoc Mia, Banh beo, Banh cuon, along with their pho roll, nem nuong cuon. All of the dishes were pretty bland as well as their fish sauce. The prices here are also pretty steep for Vietnamese food. If you are looking to eat some authentic and delicious Vietnamese food, I recommend going to San Jose. It is well worth your money there.,Outstanding...food, service, ambiance and cleanliness! The SF is cleaner and newer than San Mateo branch. The new menu is awesome compared to the old Gao Viet in San Mateo. We ordered the exquisite and unique Marrow Cracker. The coconut based mochi (coconut sticky rice) was crispy outside and chewy inside...great compliment to the bone marrow flavored pork belly topping! Then we had the Bánh Khot Street Food Appetizer. Succulent shrimp over savory crispy mini rice cups with a dash of fish sauce, green onions served with herbs, lettuce and crisp pickles. Of course we ordered the Cha Gio or Crispy Imperial Rolls...the best! Lastly we shared a large bowl of Bún Riêu Soft Shell Crab with extra Pork Hock for decadence. Absolutely stunning in looks and flavor! The heightened flavor profiles of the dishes is well worth the dollars and the wait. Our server Nancy was meticulous and efficient...actually all the servers were polite, refined and friendly. We will be back for sure...too many dishes to explore. WISH THEY HAD A BANH XEO...,This was our first time trying the SF location and it did not disappoint! The marrow cracker was my favorite dish from the San Mateo location and it was just as good - still the best thing on the menu! The five spice chicken and chubby pho were also amazing. Their broth is one of the best ones I've tried and the portions are big enough to share as well. We also tried the pho shots and lychee mixed drink which were both REALLY good. Definitely will be coming back!,I wish I could write a glowing review of how awesome this place was but that wasn't the case. We live in the neighborhood and was hoping to become regulars, but after attending the soft launch, it definitely wasn't worth the price. We understand this was their soft opening but there are a lot of kinks that need to be worked out. We ordered 2 appetizers and the beef carpaccio was good. The marrow cracker on the other hand was a huge disappointment. The rice cracker was cold and wasn't crunchy like you'd expect a cracker to be. It was soggy and the pork belly was cold and the skin was chewy and not crispy. There wasn't a lot of marrow either, so the  flavor overall was lacking.Now the entree...took about 45 mins after we finished our appetizers to come out. By that time, I went through all the stages of various stages hanger and lost my appetite. Not sure if someone forgot our ticket, but by the time the Bo Ne was served, the baguette it came with was rock hard. Literally could knock someone out with it. Couldn't even cut into it or stab it with a fork. Wth. We immediately asked for a side of rice and another piece of bread. We were basically out the door by the time the replacement bread arrived. Never got much acknowledgement from the server about this, which was also a disappointment. We have no idea where our initial server was. Had to keep asking for things (they gave us 3 chopsticks instead of 4 for example and couldn't eat the carpaccio.) Service was all over the place. The owner was making his rounds which was nice, but the food experience and the service was disappointing. Didn't even get a water refill the entire meal.For the price of the food, I don't think it's worth it.,5 stars all around. Waaayyyy better than PPQ.  Like approximately 5,0,000 times better.,I recently visited this restaurant and while the food was delicious, the service was unfortunately lacking.The Pho was above par, but the wait time for it wasn't worth it. My recommendation would be to try other dishes to make the trip worth it. However, the service needs major improvement. We waited an hour for our food and watched as half of our order was served to other tables and one dish was not made at all. The servers were inattentive and actively avoided eye contact.Food comes out in a chaotic non-sensical fashion, with entrees first and appetizers and shareables showing up an hour later.The restaurant has great food, but the service is a major downside. Be prepared for poor service. The servers need to step up their game and improve their attentiveness to customers. It is worth noting that many other reviewers have shared similar experiences with poor service, which seems to be a recurring issue at this establishment.,I cam here yesterday and was surprised to see how busy the restaurant was. This place just opened and it is already popular. We ordered many dishes to share: bun coun, snails, bun bo hue, nem nuong, and fried tofu. The snails, bun coun and nem noun were my favorite. The nem nuong reminded me of in of my favorite places in the sgv (Summer Rolls). They were so delicious. My friends and I were joking about how the vietnamese places across the street are probably so pissed... hahah. The flavor of the bun bo hue was very good but it was missing the cabbage thst you put on top which I love. I would not order the fried tofu again, the texture was good but the flavor was bland and it did not come with any sauces (we asked for fish sauce which they kindly provided).,I'm so happy that Gao has a second location (plus Ben Tre). Just like their other location, the food and service were both fantastic. We came on a rainy Sunday night and there was still a line of people waiting. Luckily, they have a bar so we were able to plop ourselves in a stool over there and get a drink plus a Coconut Breeze with Lychee for my son. There are two or three tables over there for people to sit and wait. We ordered Fresh Shrimp Rolls and later found out they sold out of shrimp so we got the Fresh Pork Rolls instead. For our main course, my husband got The Wok Pho and I decided to try something new and went with the Fermented Fish Soup with Vermicelli Noodles and Shrimp and Eggplant. We were both really happy with our choices and my son liked the vermicelli noodles and shrimp. The broth was super tasty and unique. Their portions are quite large. The quality of food/ingredients is outstanding and the use of spices is delicious. Every dish coming out of their kitchen looks so tasty. I wish I had more room to try things I saw at other tables. Service at the bar and at our table was super friendly, attentive, and personable.,Great drinks and awesome bartenders, shoutout to Chris! They got you and it'll sure be a blast when you come ^^,Delicious food!!! I've heard about their San Mateo location but never had the chance to visit. Luckily the SF location is walking distance from us so we had to give it a try it didn't disappoint, will definitely be back. Also, great atmosphere. I love what they did to the space,SF location. Great space and food was fabulous. Try something new that you wouldn't normally order and you will likely be very happy with your culinary adventure.,We got here at 5:30pm on a Friday night so we wouldn't have to wait for a table. We were seated by the kitchen and there was this strange smell. I can't explain it. Anyway we started with the chicken wings and banh hoi appetizer. Good but nothing to rave about. Hubby had the wok pho and the broth was really good. I ordered the garlic noodles three way but for some reason everyone else got their plates and I was sitting there waiting. The beef was very tender and flavorful but the garlic noodles had no flavor at all. Shrimp was okay and the imperial roll was really good. I didn't try my friends dishes so I can't say if they were good or not. High prices for Vietnamese food but good service.,Came at Gao Viet Kitchen & Bar. It has a great range of drinks and activities, it is a fun time.,Awesome food.  Ambiance is loud but exciting.  Waitress and waiters are super busy.  Only thing I didn't feel comfortable was the bar tenders.  Hopefully they'll learn to be pleasant as time go by.  Never heard of a thank you after people gave them tips.  Seems like all expected. I guessed that's how SF is.,"Great busy spot for some authentic pho and other Vietnamese dishes .  It just opened so they don't yet have a full bar or sone items on the menu but they have potential.  Flavors were great and the service efficient.  Prices were very fair as this place is not """"fancy"""".  If I lived in SF I would def add it to my list of regular spots to eat at.",Good bowl of bun bo hue. Had a lot of meat, and I liked the small dish of chilies and fish sauce to dip the pork hock in. Solid!,We've been looking for a good place for banh cuon, and when we saw Gao's menu, we were all about it. There were so many dishes on the menu that are usually hard to get in SF, like banh khot, banh beo, bun bo hue, bun rieu, and hu tieu.We came around 6pm on the first day of the soft opening and the wait wasn't too bad, maybe 10-15 minutes.Unfortunately we only had two adults, a 4-year-old, and a baby, so we couldn't get everything we wanted. Opted for the pho roll, marrow cracker, banh cuon, banh beo, and chubby pho, as well as the Holy Gao drink and lychee soda. I should have taken a picture because the feast took over the whole table.It was all very good, with some modern twists to the Viet standards. My favorites were the banh cuon and pho roll, solid versions of dishes I already knew I would like. If they open up online ordering, these are the two I'd order over and over again.The marrow cracker was interesting and tasty though a bit messy - I actually think I would have liked it more if they had just cut them in half into true bite-sized pieces. The banh beo was fine, nice crispy flavorful topping but the base was a little thick.The chubby pho was lovely, our picky 4-year-old ate most of it but we had enough to appreciate the depth of flavor. A non-traditional version of pho.I really liked the Holy Gao, refreshing and not-too-sweet drink (alcoholic) that was the perfect accompaniment to a great meal. The service was terrific, by the way, even though it was soft opening day.This review is now a lot longer than I'd planned, but it was nice to relive a great meal. Next time we're going for the cha ca la vong, banh khot, bun rieu, and grilled lobster!,I am so glad this place open up near me. They have very excellent food. Fery tasty, but it is a little on the expensive side. I still give it 5 stars because the food the I ate was very good. I will definitely will be coming back. Keep up the good work guys.,Number 1 the food is immaculate! My favorite dish was the marrow cracker and the shaking beef. Service was attentive and staff was friendly even though it was packedAmbiance was lively and on the louder side. This location is way bigger than the San Mateo one and it even has 2 stories. 10/10 would go again,Good place to eat with different kinds of food with friends. Hope you enjoy.,Great service and food. So happy gao finally opened in Sf. Parking lot in the back makes it easier to park. The bar is a nice area to drink and eat at also. Looking forward to coming back soon,Yes yes yes! Food was amazing, service was great parking sucks though and the wait is too long!  BUT worth the wait!!! We will keep coming back!,I came twice during Gao SF's soft opening and had a bad experience my second time. I came with a larger group and waiting 1 hour to be seated. After getting seated, I waited another 10 minutes to have our orders taken (our server wanted to give us time in between to order but since we saw how busy it was, we wanted to make sure to put in our orders right away). We had 8 people and the food items all came out at different times. The first item (Bun Bo Hue) came out 30 mins after we got seated. 15 mins later we got the 3 other items (all chubby pho). Then our server came over to tell us one of the items (Banh Cha) were out of stock and we decided on something else (Banh Cuon). We waiting another 15 minutes and the Banh Cuon came out. Two of us are still waiting on our Garlic Noodles and have asked the waiter multiple times to check on the status but never got any follow up. Finally, 1hr 30 mins after we got seated, when one of us decided to walk up to the window to talk to someone in charge, the remainder of our food came (garlic noodles). Everybody else had already finished their meals and were just waiting for the garlic noodles. The food was okay, beef on the garlic noodle was extremely dry. Giving this place 1 star because the noodles itself were flavorful. I would not come here again until they have more staff in the kitchen.,Amazing food. PERIOD. Service was perfect, food is always on point, and the staff is very friendly and accommodating. Our waitress Liz was so friendly and efficient. We ordered almost everything on the menu and everything was perfect! Ice coffee is exceptionally good!,I came here with a party of 6 at around 8:30pm and got in around 9Pm. I ordered the Bun Ho Hue without the pork hog and my GF ordered the Bo Luc Lac. My GF had a flight around 11:20PM. We waited for over an hr for five people's foods and I was the last one waiting on my Bun Bo Hue. I guess they forgot about it or messed up on my order, so my GF told the waiter about my Bun Bo Hue. They finally got my Bun Bo Hue out around 10-10:20. I was excited, because of all the hype about this place. I tried the first scoop of the broth and I was instantly disgusted. First of all... the broth has NO taste. It tasted watered down and there a foul odors of the pork belly as if they simmered the broth with pork belly. It didn't tasted like authentic bun Bo hue. Also, my sister and GF noticed that something was off about my Bun Bo Hue," so they asked me """"hey shouldn't you have cha lua and pork blood in your bowl?""""", that when I noticed my bowl of BHH has missing ingredients. I know that this place recently just opened, but damn... they shouldn't be messing up on the broth. Bun Bo Hue's broth should've been made a day ahead!! It needed the aroma of them anise, cardamom, and the spiciness!! That's a signature BUN!!! I'll come to give it another try some other time. This seriously disappointed me.   Ya got to step up on them Bun Bo Hue's vegetables, pork belly odors, & broth!! ‍ I already knew the broth was going to be a fail, because I noticed there are no aroma of the BROTH when I walked into the restaurant. COME ON!!! Ya a Vietnamese restaurant.,The food as pictured is very delicious on an epic level and the ambience is very warm and elegant. It's a very cozy place and time will go by without your realization and the Bar is very well stocked and has very personalized service. I highly recommend this place and I personally with be a repeat customer.,This place lives up to the hype! About a 15 minute wait on opening night. Food is really good, drinks are good. The only con is that prices are a bit steep," even accounting for inflation/Bay Area prices.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JIJIME,"This is one of my favorite places in the Richmond if not all of San Francisco! Everything I have ever had here is mouth-wateringly delicious. I recommend ordering from their tapas menu, everything is delicious, and you get a wide variety of foods to taste! The service is good, and little to no wait times for walk-ins. We got the following: - Corn Cheese: so incredibly delicious I order this every time I come in; I can't get enough. I could eat plates of this. This is such a staple for Korean snack food, and for a good reason too. It's salty with a tiny hint of sweet; seriously please get this to try! It comes out on a hot, sizzling hotplate, so the cheese stays melted the whole time. It is a dine-in option only! - Popcorn Salmon: My dad's favorite. He gets this every time we come here! Delicious and pairs so beautifully with the mayonnaise dip. - Boneless Fried Chicken (soy garlic): usually, I wouldn't say I like fried chicken (controversial, I know), and I like glazes even less (very controversial, again) however, I can scarf a plate of these down alone. They're so delicious they had me rethinking my dislike for fried chicken with glazes. So delicious, you will not be disappointed. - Pork belly Salad (not pictured): amazing! I am a pork belly stan, so I always order pork belly when I spot it on a menu. This pork belly salad is so delicious the pieces melt in your mouth! My mouth is watering just thinking about it while writing this review. The salad it comes on also has bomb dressing. Highly recommended. - Spicy Tofu Stew: I LOVED this, it was my first time ordering soup here, and I should have known it would be delicious based on the track record of stunning foods here. It was so nice to have a hot soup with all our tapas. Just so delicious I will be ordering this again.,I visited JIJIME for the first time on a Wednesday night because me and my friends were craving ramen. It was our first visit and the restaurant wasn't too busy so we were able to be seated immediately. Our server was very nice and gave helpful suggestions since we weren't sure what to order. Okonomiyaki Fries: 5/5Really good! I loved the crisp ones of the fries and I loved the toppings and sauce they pair with it. A really good appetizer to split with your table. Gyoza Ramen: 4/5Really filling and I like how they put a lot of noodles! I actually had leftovers that I took home because the bowl was much larger than expected. I thought the gyoza was just okay, but the broth and noodles were pretty good. Pink Lemonade: 5/5Exactly what you'd expect it to taste like, no complaints here!Overall, had a pretty good time here and the service was really good as well. Would recommend!,I love Jijime, it's probably one of my favorite korean spots in the city! The place is cozy and perfect for both small and large parties. They take reservations so that's a plus. I love the fact that there are so many appetizers and fun bites to choose from. The boneless fried chicken is a must try (all the flavors are quite delicious), so crispy and flavorful. I was also surprised by how well made their ramen was. Super rich and creamy broth, generous portions, and fresh ingredients.Service is super fast, and such a fun restaurant to visit with friends!,I went here on a Saturday around 4:30pm and there was no wait. Anyways, we were quickly seated so I guess that's good.We ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen, Bimbimbap Bowl, and Okonomiyaki Fries. Once our food came, we took some pictures of it, but it felt like the waitress didn't want us to take pictures of the food. I didn't like how the waitress rushed us since that made me feel a bit uncomfortable.Now, about the food! I really enjoyed the Okonomiyaki Fries and it was fun watching the flakes move when it first arrived. The fries also had some type of sauce on it and wasn't too soggy. The Tonkotsu Ramen was good too and I liked how chewy the noodles were. I also tried the Bimbimbap Bowl and loved how much meat and flavor it had! I'm usually not someone who orders bimbimbap bowls because everything gets mixed together, but that one tasted good.I'd recommend this place, but maybe don't take pictures of your food here when it's almost dinner time. All the food tasted good, but the service wasn't that great when I was here.,Very cute and cozy Korean restaurant. After a visit to the Legion of Honor, boyfriend and I came here for lunch, and thankfully seated immediately. For appetizers, we got karaage, which was good. My boyfriend got a soup and a bowl of rice. I love hot stone bibimbap, so I ordered a sizzling chicken bibimbap. I had requested brown rice when I put in my order, and they forgot my request and brought me white rice. They were nice to swap it out immediately. For dessert, we enjoyed the mango panna cotta. Very filling, and a nice little gem.,Was craving ramen after a night out and stopped by here to try their ramen. Interior is really cute and very chill vibes with jazz music playing in the background. Service was average but our server was attentive with refilling water. Kiage Tempura (not pictured): This was a veggie tempura fried in a way that it resembles a scallion/kimchi pancake. Very unique. The tempura crunch was nice and fluffy. The dish overall didn't feel like it was oily or heavily fried. 4.5/5Kuro Ramen: Broth was very rich and possibly a little too decadent after a few sips. Not as garlicky as i expected with the black garlic oil but the garlic flavor was present. Noodles were very average and kinda look like they were instant noodles. Chashu was good with a nice sear. 3.5/5Tonkatsu Ramen: Same as the Kuro ramen, except no garlic and was a little creamier. Both were medium but the tonkatsu one felt spicier. 3.,Today I came back to jijime.I got koru ramen. I enjoyed the soup and noodles and pork as I usually do. The egg was slightly under-flavored. The server was friendly. Playing relaxing jazz music from their speakers at 4 pm and still enjoy their light choices.,This place wins the award for the worst tofu stew I've ever had. I was craving tofu stew when I met up with a friend to dine here. Despite the fact that this place is known for other dishes, I still went ahead and ordered a tofu stew because I was simply craving it. Wow what a mistake! I ordered a pork tofu stew with medium spice. There were barely any tiny pieces of pork, and the small broken apart pieces of tofu looked like they were leftovers from something else. Meanwhile the stew was very watered down, lacked flavor, was not spicy at all, and was so lukewarm that it did not taste fresh. The tofu stew also had tons of cooked white onions in it as a cheap filler ingredient to make up for the lack of pork and tofu. In line with this cost cutting approach, I was not surprised that this restaurant doesn't serve any banchan either.Additionally, as someone with a green onion allergy, I was disappointed to see tons of green onions in the stew despite no mention of it on the menu. Had the menu description been accurate, I would've been able to ask for no green onions ahead of time. Instead, I spent 5 minutes picking each piece out myself. I highly recommend the restaurant to update its menu to help out customers with certain food allergies/intolerances.,TLDR: nice hot ramen in a nice little restaurant with good service--My fiancé and I came here for dinner one day during the week after work. Surprisingly it was almost full around 5pm on a Wednesday! Luckily we got there early and didn't need reservation. However on a busy weekend, I would probably expect to wait for a table..I got the Kuro Ramen which is basically their tonkotsu with black garlic oil. If you like garlic and a bit more flavor, definitely go with this one and it doesn't cost any extra! The egg was runny, as a soft boiled should be, and the broth was nice and hot on the super cold day. The only thing that wasn't spot on was the chashu. It tasted good, but the texture was tough and seemed almost dry. The service staff was super nice and attentive and I have no complaints here. The restrooms were not very clean, so be prepared. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place to friends and family, but there are also a lot of other great ramen restaurants in the city. Some other places even allow you to choose the firmness of your noodles! If you're in this area and looking for a hot bowl of ramen, this is an easy choice.,The Asian Fusion cuisine game is alive and well, especially when looking for somewhere to dine while in San Francisco's Richmond District and JIJIME is an izakaya andramen restaurant that provides customers with a wide variety of dishes inspired by both Korean and Japanese cuisine sold at decent prices. What brought a group of diners and I to JIJIME on a recent weekday evening for dinner, was a celebration of sorts, and our host was looking for a different place to dine for our large party and they remembered dining at JIJIME years before and they thought they would be the perfect place to host our large party. Finding parking in this area of the Outer Richmond can be quite the challenge most times, but it was early on a weekday evening that we came and we managed to get lucky and found a spot on the corner of Geary Boulevard and 20th Avenues. The interior of the restaurant is narrow and small, but since we came on a weeknight evening and make arrangements ahead of time, our table along one side of their wall was already ready for us, and other tables were constantly being filled with customers, with no wait time for anyone who wanted a table, which was nice. The menu at JIJIME is broken up into sections including Small Bites, which included both Korea and Japanese Style Tapas;  Ramen, in which its broth is cooked for over 21 hours; Soup; Plates which are all served on sizzling iron skillets; Sizzling Bibimbap; and Desserts.To start our meal, we opted to share a number of small appetizers. We ordered their Corn Cheese, which was sweet corn served with a creamy sauce and cheese served on a sizzling iron pan; their Bulgogi Quesadilla, which is a grilled quesadilla served with Bulgogi Beef and Cheese, their Okonomiyaki Fries, which were deep fried French Fries topped with bonito flakes, creamy mayo and savory katsu sauce; and two versions of their Boneless Fried Chicken, served Korean Style, one spicy and one with honey butter. For our entrées, a number of us, including myself, were drawn to their Beef Short Ribs from the Plates section of their menu, which featured Marinated Premium Beef Short Ribs served on a sizzling iron plate along with a variety of raw vegetables including onions, peppers and mushrooms. This plate also came with a side salad and bowl of steamed rice. Others in our party ordered from their Sizzling Bibimbap, which was a Korean style rice bowl served on a large sizzling pan, along with steamed rice, seasonal sautéed vegetables, a fried egg and their choice of protein in which most in our party selected their Bulgogi, which was beef marinated in soy sauce, or their Fried Tofu, or for a nominal fee ordered both the Bulgogi and Tofu.It didn't take too long for our appetizers to come out and my personal favorites were their Quesadilla and Boneless Fried Chicken. As they were both savory and flavorful without being overstuffed with too many ingredients. Since I ordered from the Plate section of their menu, I received my side salad, and there was a little confusion after those who ordered from the Bibimbap section did not receive a side salad, but either way the salad was simple with iceberg lettuce, a couple of sliced cherry tomatoes, sliced radishes and topped with a dressing that was too sour for my tastebuds. Then came our entrées, in which my meat arrived on a still sizzling plate with the Short Ribs being cooked just to my liking. Unfortunately others in our party received their Short Ribs before I did and their meat was way too well done for their liking so much so that they couldn't finish their meal. Others really liked their Bibimbap sizzling plates, as they looked like they were filled with an abundance of ingredients and seemed to be a satisfying meal. When it came time for dessert, we actually brought our own cake to celebrate a particularly happy occasion for one of our diners, and although they didn't tell us at the time, they do charge 10 dollars plus tax for a cake cutting fee, which is a bit much considering all they did was offer to store our cake in their refrigerator and give us a cake knife and small plates in order for us to cut our cake ourselves. Would I return to JIJIME for a future meal? They have an eclectic enough menu served at affordable prices to warrant a potential second look, but there is also so much competition in the neighborhood that primarily serves either just Korean and just Japanese that no place serves it all under one roof, so give credit where it is due as this aspect makes JIJIME especially unique.,The food here was really good. Service was really prompt and everything tasted really flavorful. The bibimbap and dak galbi with cheese were all really sizable portions. The interior design of the place was also really cute.,Everything I ordered from here was 5/5. The potato croquettes were crispy and I love how they came with ranch. I appreciated that they offered a boneless chicken wing, and the sweet and spicy was just the right balance. The star of the show was the bibimbap in a cast iron due mostly to its sheer size. I added glass noodles and they have gochujang on the side for you. This place just has so many classics and trendy items that are executed very well. The service was great.,Interesting food concept Korean Asian fusion and they advertise as such & I'm not sure what that is exactly. Scanning the menu, it's predominately Korean with a sprinkling of Japanese and maybe some Chinese influence.The most ""innovative"" dish offering was  a sizzling bibimbap--kind of gimmicky at $20, if you ask me. Bibimbap in a hot dolsot is already crispy and sizzling. Here it's served on a larger scale flat sizzling skillet and you get to mix it up like you would a teppan rice platter, so what makes it fusion? The chicken jjim was sweet and smothered in cheese.  The curry korokke were 2 heart shaped pieces (for $7.50), cut in half--so it looks like you got more than you actually did. It was grease free, crispy and tasty, although the ranch dipping sauce was interesting. We also ordered the boneless fried chicken--it was 3 party wings.  The ramen in tonkotsu broth was nothing outstanding to callout.I'm not sure why they call themselves Asian fusion--it seems like a restaurant that doesn'tknow what to serve--as they serve a mix of Korean, Japanese and a few Chinese dishes and being able to order in a 1-stop shop, I would not consider it fusion.I didn't think it was worth the long wait--for what amounts to a nothingburger.,Came here in a group of 4 including one friend who was vegetarian. Would characterize this as a reliable neighborhood spot, but don't know if it would be the kind of place that I'd travel to the Richmond for if I weren't in the area. To be fair, we tried a limited selection of their food:Veggie Potstickers - averageCorn Cheese - I've never had a bad version of this anywhere in the worldCroquette - can't remember veggie or curry, so this wasn't that memorableChicken Karaage - decently averageTofu Bibimap - this was presented beautifully and had a good amount of vegetables, just wish there was a bit more rice! Definitely food enough for two at least,Delicious Korean food and a great local atmosphere. The customer service was great and the food was delicious.,Came here for a late lunch. I was greeted and seated immediately. I got the tonkatsu ramen. It came out fairly quickly and piping hot.It was very filling with lots of noodles, a soft boiled egg, some greens, and 2 slices of pork belly. The ramen and broth had a bit of a powdery feel to it, but nothing too egregious.Service was quick and the bathrooms were also clean. I would come back again.,Was excited to get the tofu soup, extra spicy. Was a bit disappointed by how bland the soup was overall. Was not impressed with the soup stock nor the spice level. I ordered seafood as the protein, and that was the only positive. There was 2 larger shrimps, several tiny shrimps, a couple small pieces of scallop, about 2 mussels. So a nice variety of seafood protein. My friend got the beef bibambap and she also said her food was quite bland. Service was mediocre.,Had dinner there. They made the food pretty quickly. We ordered Takoyaki, popcorn salmon, grilled pork belly plate, boneless fried chicken, corn cheese, crispy fried seaweed roll, spicy kimchi stew, and soy pork plate. I like the corn cheese, grilled pork belly plate, and soy pork plate. Oh yea, we ordered mango panna cotta too. I don't know how to tell you whether if it's good or bad. I don't like mango so don't take it from me. Friends said popcorn salmon is kinda sus but I like it. Spicy kimchi stew is okay because I have high expectations for kimchi. (Unpopular opinion, nothing beats kimchi in Busan, they are just different) The food is okay. Everything is pretty okay. It's a great dating spot for a first or second date. Only if you or your date's wallet size is okay too. Cuz it's low-key expensive. I'm supposed to give it a 4 stars but I can't cuz servers are too nice.,Came here a few weeks ago before heading to the Legion of Honor -- super convenient location for a pre-museum lunch. The restaurant space was pretty small, but it also wasn't too busy. I can't quite describe it, but the chill jazz music that was playing in the background that day somehow worked really well in the dark space and made me feel super comfortable.We ordered the pork belly salad, okonomiyaki fries, and bulgogi sizzling plate to share between 2 people. Out of these 3 dishes, the pork belly salad was my favorite. Flavor was 100/10, HIGHLY recommend. The fries were pretty crispy and not weighed down so much by the okonomiyaki sauce that they were soggy. The bulgogi sizzling plate was massive. This one was just okay for me, as my mind was on the pork belly salad the whole time. I need to come back again to try the other appetizers and the ramen. Time to find more excuses to go back out to the Richmond district!,Overall, great place!! Did a walk-in for two people on Sunday dinner time and waited for about 15 mins. The entire place is so cozy and comforting. Tonkatsu Ramen - average to me and wasn't impressive. It was more garlicky than pork broth tasting. I got mild spice but I didn't taste it at all. Bulgogi - very solid and yummy!! Comes with a lot of veggies and glass noodle. Came hot on the stone plate too.Kimchi stew - very much on the sour side but it was perfect for a cold day.,haven't been here in a while but just came here couple days ago with a large party. Made the reservation and we got seated in a timely manner. All the food that came out was great. I do think the popcorn salmon portion wise was a lot smaller than i came here before but still tasted great. Notable mentions were definitely the pork belly plate and soy chicken jjim, so good! Absolutely delicious. The boneless fried chicken was also really good. Took a while to come out but it came out crispy, crunchy and full of flavor! All the bibimbaps came out on a flat iron skillet, amazing presentation and love their sweet gochujang sauce! Definitely will be back again,Not from San Francisco, but my local friends seem to all rave about this place. I decided I had to try it, and well, it didn't disappoint. I will say the Spicy Chicken Jjim Plate and the Veggie Bibimbap tasted a bit bland. I would argue that their dishes are easy to replicate at home for $5-10 per serving. It wasn't terrible in taste by any means, but not worth the price value. As many other Yelpers have mentioned, this place is definitely not a ""super authentic Korean or Japanese restaurant."" If you're looking for an alright/decent Asian Fusion restaurant, go here. I heard it's better relative to the other places. If you want authentic Asian cuisine, I'd recommend you go to other parts of San Francisco. I will say their Popcorn Salmon was REALLY good. hence the four stars. I've never tried anything like that before, and I would seriously consider coming back here just for that.,Small, quaint restaurant that has good food and it's all reasonably priced. No reservations needed for a weekday dinner either, at least when we went around 7pm on a Thursday. It's definitely more fusion, with Japanese and Korean menu items. I loved the curry croquettes and chicken jjim. I'd be down to come back and try a ramen.,After trying to go to Han Il Kwan and realizing it was closed, my friends and I decided to try this place out instead. It's an Asian fusion place, serving Korean and Japanese inspired dishes. We shared the takoyaki and the boneless korean fried chicken and they were both tasty but not particularly special. I ordered the sizzling bibimbap with soy garlic chicken. The chicken was pretty tasty and the portion was quite big, but I wouldn't really say it was reminiscent of bibimbap, which I guess I should have expected given the place is fusion-y. It was served with salad greens which was kind of confusing, and the dish was also kind of greasy and my rice didn't get that crispy despite the whole thing being on a hot cast iron.A couple of my other friends got the different ramens and said the broth was pretty tasty but the ramen overall was not particularly amazing.Maybe my perception of the place is a little skewed because we were hoping to get Korean food for the night at Han Il Kwan and ended up at a more fusion place. Overall the food was fine and everything was tasty enough, but it didn't quite impress.,Keep in mind this is an Asian Fusion spot, so don't expect super authetic Korean or Japanese food. I made a reservation for 8 people ahead of time. They were surely busy. It took 40 minutes for us to receive our food after ordering...I got the Chicken Jjim, which was decent. It lacked a bit of depth in flavor for me... Mainly tasted like soy sauce. The chicken was fairly tender and it paired well with the cheese and veggies. I was shocked to see there were no potatoes in this jjim though!! It also needed a lot more glass noodles. We got the Okonomiyaki Fries too, which were a good appetizer. Similar texture to McDonald's fries!My friends all tried the Sizzling Bibimbap and seemed to really enjoy it! It comes out on an entire cast iron skillet, which is pretty cool. The texture of the rice changes as you eat it"" says one of my friends who has never had dolsot before LOL,It's a small restaurant but we were seated immediately after arriving for dinner on Friday night. The waitress immediately brought us water and made sure that our cups were never empty!For our appetizer, ordered the spicy boneless fried chicken which was delicious. We also ordered the lychee soju cocktail pitcher. Not too long after, our food came out. We had the bulgogi bibimbap and the gyoza ramen. The bulgogi bibimbap had lots of vegetables and they gave us a bottle of the sauce which I preferred. The ramen was a little salty but it was still great! Overall the food was delicious and I would definitely come back. Next time I will be ordering the spicy chicken jjim plate with cheese!,What a fun place and new addition to this section of Outer Richmond in SF's little Russia aka the Avenues.  This Korean Asian Fusion spot is always busy nowadays.  We found this place during the pandemic when most restaurants were closed for dine-in, so it wasn't busy at all.   We usually eat at Tasty's, but they weren't open for dine-in, so we tried this place; although totally different than Hong Kong style food, I convinced mom to try something new and unique.  She's been hooked ever since.  They have a great happy hour.  Not a huge restaurant, no TV's to watch a game or two, and parking is difficult.  Make a reservation, get the sizzling Korean short ribs, and colorful pork belly salad.  Haven't tried the ramen yet.  A variety of gooey cheesy dishes for cheese lovers.  Not many dessert options...we ordered the mango panna cotta, and it was on point (didn't want to share).       'Til next time ~ cheers & see you on Yelp (SYOY)!,Cute and trendy place on Geary! Parking was difficult to find, but that's to be expected in SF. Be sure to come here early; it was pretty empty around 6 on a Sunday, but there was a line out the door by the time I left :0Popcorn Salmon: I've never considered fried salmon, so this was a fun appetizer to try! The sauce was delicious and I saved some to add to the other dishes (but didn't end up using it cuz they were saucy enough on their own).Soy Garlic Chicken Jjim (+Cheese): Yumm, loved the flavor on this! It was more sweet than garlicky, but the additional cheese really tied everything together. Pairing this dish with something spicy or salt-based (like the ramen I'd assume) is my rec.Spicy Seafood Sizzling Bibimbap: The bibimbap seems to be the most popular dish here, so we had to try this. There wasn't that much in it, but the flavor was good. I enjoyed the crispy rice from the bottom of the stone bowl.This is a cool spot to check out if you are indecisive about whether you want Korean (missing Daeho a little), ramen, or even just Japanese tapas.,First time here. And it was fantastic. My fiancée and I ordered the Sizzling Bibimbaps, mine spicy seafood, and hers soy chicken. I ordered extra protein and veggies for mine as well. Both the chicken and the seafood bibimbap were incredibly tasty. The marinades for the proteins are so flavorful. The rice is perfectly crisp without being burnt. The veggies were a great mix between being crisp, yet still well cooked. And the portion sizes were solid. The service was a tad slow, but the meals were well worth the wait!,Great Korean food in Richmond district! My family came here on a whim while we were in the area.Half of us got the ramen, and the other half got bibimbap or plates. I think the bulgogi plate (what I ordered) is the most flavorful and also the most bang for your buck! The meat is flavorful and the veggies are perfectly charred. I would probably not recommend ramen -- the portion is small and the flavor is good but not great! Stick to popular ramen spots!!Lastly, the sizzling bibimbap skillet!! This is the item that catches your attention right away, but I would still recommend the plates over this because you get more meat and less rice!Overall this place was quite tasty and I would return. If you are in the area definitely try out Gaspare's pizza and the Piroshki shop next door -- they are both delicious too.,A local favorite! The Sizzling Bibimbap (Korean Rice With Mixed Vegetables)  was hands down one of the best meals we've had in SF. Good quality fresh ingredients, artful presentation, welcoming staff, careful attention to details, reasonable prices and prompt service. My son, a picky eater, finished his entire meal and asked if we could go back to this place again when we're in the city. I would rate this a 9.5/10 due to seating space was small but overall, good food experience; will be going back again.,Come here for the salmon ball (appetizer) if anything, you won't be disappointed. I couldn't get enough of that sauce it comes with too (an aioli?). I can't eat spicy food at all but the no spicy soup makes it a bit bland like it's watered down. I'd recommend the mild or medium soup next time!,Cozy fusion restaurant with fire fried chicken :). My friend and I split the boneless fried chicken (soy garlic flavor), and I ordered the sizzling bibimbap w/ bulgogi while she got the tonkotsu sesame ramen.A lot of people in the comments rave about the fried chicken, and it lived up to my expectations -- they came hot and fresh, and the chicken was perfectly tender and juicy inside. There was a ton of flavor from the glaze, but the batter (almost like a shell) stayed crispy and somewhat fluffy? It's a different type of crunch from the fried chicken I usually get. I've only had Korean fried chicken a couple of times before and never particularly enjoy it, but this changed my view. I'd make the trip out (literally 45 minutes for me) just for this chicken -- the honey butter flavor looks amazing.The bibimbap was pretty different from other Korean restaurants', which surprised me: the vegetables are pretty untraditional and sautéed together (again untraditional), and the bulgogi was minced pretty finely, more reminiscent of ground beef to me. I love how it came in its own little pan and a cute wooden spoon, but I don't think the pan was hot enough because the rice didn't crisp up at the bottom, which is what I ordered it for :(. While I think the dish was tasty, I wouldn't really say it's bibimbap, and I'd go somewhere else for it: I love bibimbap for its assortment of vegetables and different textures/flavors, and I think this dish lacked that and was a bit bland.My friend had similar thoughts on her food and said her ramen was just okay -- the noodles were cooked to a nice al dente, but she wasn't too impressed by the broth. I can't comment on the other dishes of course, but based on our experience, I think the fried chicken and likely the other tapas are where this restaurant really shines and what I'd come back for! The fried appetizers literally make up half the menu, and honestly, they all sound delicious, and I'd probably just share a few appetizers and maybe one main dish next time.,The boyfriend and I had dinner here before we went to our show at the Palace theater. it was only 12 min away, so location was good for us, and when I saw Korean/Japanese fusion, I was like okay okay let's go see what's poppin. However, the parking situation over in this area is horrific. We circled around and around for a good 10-15 min before we lucked out and found street parking just a block over. The restaurant is pretty tiny inside so it fills up fast. We ordered 3 apps and 1 main entree. Apps: TakoyakiCurry CroquetteBoneless fried chicken I saw good reviews about the fried chicken but I feel like all y'all lied because the chicken is really not that great. Flavor wise it's decent but it's dry af. There isn't any crispy crunchiness to it either, like you would get with typical Korean fried chicken. The sauce was alright, but it's on the lower end of what I've come to expect for soy garlic. The curry croquette was good, however the sauce it paired with was odd. It tasted like a thin, and more sour ranch? Whatever it was, it didn't go well together. Also, you only get 2 thin croquettes. The flavor and crunch were good but the portion size is sooo tiny. They were cute though, looked like 2 hearts on the plate. Great balls of fire! These takoyaki balls were huge! lol Some were normal sized, but some were pretty fat. My bf liked the thickness of the outside, and the inside had that nice gooeyness to it that takoyaki should have. The sauce was a miss, which is just so sad because I'm a sauce girl all the way. For our entree, we went with the chicken jjim to share. I ordered this with cheese but it came without. I asked them to add cheese, which they did, but I felt it wasn't as gooey as it could have been had they added it in the first place. Once we stirred things up, it did melt. Our chicken jjim had bell peppers, mushroom, chicken, and zucchini but NO NOODLES. I know it's supposed to come with glass noodles because 1) the menu and 2) the guy next to us had hella noodles in his plate. I didn't feel like complaining another time so we let it go. We weren't super hungry anyways but it's the principle. We went with the spicy flavor and it was good.. it was spicy so a bonus star for that and it paired well with the bowl of rice it came with. I felt like between our apps plus the entree, 1 bowl of rice was fine to split. However, this is definitely one of those foods you need to eat with rice, so you might want to opt for another bowl. We got water refills in a timely fashion. We didn't have anyone check up on us at all.. but that's fine. We don't typically need much. To get to the bathroom, you have to walk through the kitchen. Weird, but I get it, it's SF. They were nice about giving us to go boxes, however I do feel they should write down orders and repeat them back. I hate when waitresses don't do this and then someone this missing or incorrect - case and point, my missing cheese. I think this is an okay option if you're in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. There are tons of restos in the same street so plenty of options to choose from.,Here's a hidden gem for you!

"ect casual dinner place. It's pretty low key from the outside when we walk past it. So it's kind of a """"if you know you know"""" type of restaurant. I went after work with my coworker and we went right around the time they open. Good thing we got there early because the place became full by the time we left. The servers were really nice and attentive. I always appreciate people who refill my water quickly because I drink a lot of water. To start", we had the boneless fried chicken. Compared to actual Korean fried chicken, it was okay. In general, the chicken was really good and the honey butter sauce was super sweet and sticky. They weren't the crispiest but I didn't mind because the batter was like fluffy vs crispy. For my main, I had the spicy chicken jjim with cheese. This was soo good! If you like Daeho and don't want to spend a lot of money, then come here! There was so much food that I some too eat the next day. The spicy sauce was super flavorful and there was a good mix of veggies. The food comes out in a timely manner and tastes delicious. Jijime is now my new go to neighborhood restaurant!,I came here as a party of 4 around 6pm on a saturday and it was super busy! Luckily we were able to snag the last open table when we walked in. With that in mind, it did take awhile to actually receive our food after we ordered (around 25-30 minutes). My fiancé and I ordered the spicy chicken jjim with cheese added (definitely add the cheese). The taste was pretty decent for the price we paid! I just wish there was more chicken vs. vegetables - might have to add extra meat next time!,I gave it 4 stars because it was pretty pricey.  But the food was delicious .  I would definitely come back again.  Their popcorn salmon was tasty. Its a small place and the tables are on the smaller side.  My boys who are almost 6ft, sat on the bench side were not happy.  Their back was hurting from bending over to eat. Table was pretty low.  Other than that, food was .,I remember visiting this restaurant years ago upon arriving for the night. There were only two ladies running the show for the front of the house. We were greeted momentarily upon arriving the front of the restaurant. One of the ladies cleaned a table for us right by the entrance. We asked if it was possible to take the one that was available more inside the restaurant. She shared with us that it was set aside for a party of  7 later which was understandable. As we just sat down, she let us know that another table just paid and she would be able to move us more towards the back which was appreciated. I didn't remember the menu having interesting items, especially on the small plates side. Honestly, we could totally order more small plates instead of getting rice dish nor ramen. Out of all that we had, we were surprised by the popcorn Salmon and the boneless fried chicken. The chicken was so JUICY!! The okonomiyaki fries were over rated compared to the salmon and the chicken. The pork belly salad had a good balanced too. I would not suggest to add stir fried kimchi because it didn't feel like it was stir fried, or it could be my misunderstanding. In terms of the bibimbap, it was the presentation and the container that made the difference. I personally prefer the traditional bowl. For the service and the creativity on the dishes, I would recommend this place for everyone and returning for more dishes myself. P.S. it's the Richmond District, therefore, parking can be challenging.,Came here on a Saturday evening. It was packed, the venue is small, took us about an hour to get seated. In the meantime, w visited the Russian bakery to get some breakfast stuff.Servers are nice, but can be hard to pin them at times.Food was decent. Popcorn salmon was just okay.The bugolgi quesadilla did hit the spot for me and my family although it is in the sweet side.Pork belly pot is also nice.Chicken jjim is okay.Portions are small, but the environment is nice and the food plating and taste is fresh and interesting.,Hands down to one of the best ramen places in the Bay Area! We had several amazing dishes! This place will now would be one of my go to restaurants in SF! I came with my family  (party of 3) on a Saturday around noon and we were seated right away. The area is busy but we got lucky and found parking right in front of the restaurant. For appetizers, we ordered:- Curry Croquette 5/5: Wow! They were delicious! Cooked to perfection with a very subtle taste of curry. Very well balanced! -Boneless Fried Chicken 5/5: the chicken was juicy, and flavorful. It had a glaze type of sauce. A bit spicy but not overpowering.- Beef Potstickers 2/5: Very disappointed. I do want to point out that this appetizer  was forgotten and when it was brought to us, it was noticeable that it was rushed. The potstickers  were burnt and extremely covered in oil. For the main dishes, we ordered:-Bulgogi Bowl 5/5: my daughter loved it! It was big! The bowl comes with rice, japchae, salad and the meat. -Spicy Kimchi Stew 4/5: I ordered mine with pork. You can choose pork, vegetables or gyoza. The broth had a sour taste to it. It was good but more on the sour side. It could have been the kimchi. -Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen: amazing broth!! There was so much flavor in this dish! I was blown away but the taste of the broth. When I get ramen, the broth is everything to me and this place did not disappoint. I am adding for sure this place to my go to list next time I am in SF. I can't wait to try other dishes.,"I had an excellent dinner here with respectable service and a nice ambiance. The restaurant has an elegant interior and was happy to accommodate my single ass.I was torn between the Pork Belly Grill Plate or """"Korean Drunk Food"""" and tonight", drunk food won out-- I ordered the Spicy Chicken jJim-- which is basically tteokkbokki chicken, minus the rice cakes. Their version offers plenty of caramelized onions, shreds of enoki mushroom, and a scant but sufficient portion of sweet potato noodle. Oh, and I ordered it topped with torched cheese. It came out bubbling with a vengeance and was super sexy. It's very saucy, packed with extra veggies, and not burn-your-butthole spicy, but definitely a kick-it-up-a-notch choice from my ulterior option of grilled pork belly.I ordered a side salad for $2.00 that was super fresh and had a nice light gingery dressing (Jan. 2022). Also small hot sake which was a pleasant addition.All in all I am certain to return to try other menu items. I spied on the other patrons and had extreme menu envy while stuffing my pie hole.,Ordered the bulgogi to go, it was very flavorful and tasty! I do think meat was slightly skimped on and there were a LOT of filler vegetables and jap chae under the top layer of meat. Total came out to be almost $22.,Had the fried salmon- reminds me of popcorn salmon balls), kalbi beef - very thin and tender with onions, something comes with side salad with really good tangy dressing, and pork belly buns - buns was thick and not fluffy with green onions  This meal was a bit pricey and had no leftovers.  It was tasty.,Found this place at 3:30 pm on a Saturday afternoon, after a 7 mile walk at the golden date park. Parking was hard to find and we took about 20 mins to find a parking and we found a parking lot about 2 blocks away. Fast and Good service, we knew what we wanted and went ahead and ordered. We were served rather quickly and was also explained about the sauce they use in Bibimbap. I wasn't a fan of the sizzling crispy rice in the bibimbap dish but loved the soy garlic chicken and the crispy veggies. Popcorn potstickers are a must and were great with sake. Peach Soju was so good after spending 2.5 hours in the sun, however It was a little tough to finish the small pitcher by myself as it was a little too sweet for me. I totally loved the mango panna cotta. Will revisit the place sometime soon to try their other dishes.,A fun Korean spot in the Richmond area! My friends and I decided to try this spot on a Sunday for lunch, and was glad they were able to accomodate our group of 7. Their interior decor is very cute and I can see this being a great spot for dinner + drinks as well. Parking in the area may be a little trickier but if you are patient enough and just circle around the area a few times," you should be able to find a spot :)Their hot sake is very reasonably priced at $5 for a """"large""""; we ordered 2 to share.  We shared a few appetizers - boneless fried chicken", kakiage tempura and veggie croquette. All were yummy, but my favorite was definitely the boneless fried chicken (soy garlic) and highly recommend this item.We shared a bunch of entrees, including the grilled pork belly plate, bulgogi plate, chicken jjim and a few sizzlling bibimbaps. The bibimbap was plated very nicely and had a different selection of sauted veggies that what I am used to. I'm not the biggest fan of pork belly but I really loved the chicken jjim (add cheese!) and bulgogi plates - the glass noodles soak up the sauce which makes it extra yummy. Glad we tried this place out and look forward to returning!,Delicious ramen. Good service. Nice ambience. Ramen is perfect for a cold day in San Francisco.,So....this might be my favorite place in the neighborhood. How much do I like it? One time we got food from here three times in one week. I love the ramen. It may not blow your mind but it is cozy and delicious and the broth will make you happy. Definitely get at least mild or medium spice; you will be missing out if you get it with no spice. My favorite is probably the sesame ramen. The only one I wouldn't order again is the gyoza ramen. When you order online to pick it up they almost always have it ready in less time than quoted. The sizzling bibimbap is also cozy and delicious with perfectly cooked veggies and rice. I have yet to try the small dishes because I know the larger plates will fill me up but one of these days I need to come and try all the things. I see other people order them and they all look so tasty.,I don't frequent SF anymore but a friend was in town and I didnt know any good spots since I last visited a year or two ago. Luckily YELP was there to help! I started yelping what was in the area and this gem popped up. It looks new and the images of the food looked yummy. Like all food spots in the area, street parking is hard to find but we came on a Thursday night and parking wasn't too hard to get.Ramen spots oddly have small spaces and when we arrived an hour after they opened, they were already packed. They do take reservations so if you know you're going to eat here, call them up and save that spot. It took about 15 mins for us to get seated and the host did notified us they are short staff and with everything going on, it was not surprising. So be nice to the staff. For short staff, the host was very attentive and nothing was late or slow. They get extra points there!We ordered the corn cheese, kuro ramen, tonkotus sesame ramen, and the sizzling bibimbap with pork belly.The sizzling bibimbap took the win for the main entree here. The ramen noodles were too soft and the soup was a bit too salty for me. The corn cheese wasn't bad either but also a bit too salty. I would still order it again. If you're in the area, definitely hit this place up.,Second time here.  Little hole in the wall but great food and very cold beer. It is always hard to find a place that the kids and wife will like. This is one of those places that everyone one will find something they will like. One of the kids had ramen the other one me had chicken wings and a Korean quesadilla. The wife had the house special and I had the short ribs. All good, no great food. This place is a must go to.,9/5/22I have a lot of reviews to write, so sorry for the dry review in advance.It's a nice looking place, but it was a full house this evening, and they're clearly understaffed.  Our waitress was clearly flustered and I could see she was struggling to remain pleasant.  Most of the time we couldn't find anyone to bring us plates, or water, or worse, I think she or the kitchen screwed up our order many times...1. Iced Tea $3:  This is refillable, but as I said our waitress was never around, so though I was super thirsty I think she only refilled 2x and I left thirsty.2. Boneless Chicken," Honey Butter $12 """"Korean style crispy boneless chicken"""":  And yeah... so not sure what happened here.  Whatever we got was covered in thick sweetened soy sauce.  I can't fathom this is """"honey butter.""""  And I generally like Korean fried chicken", but I hate these super strong sauces, hence picking their butter sauce.  Anyway, for what it was, it was okay.  I assume this was their soy sauce sauce, so given that's what it was, it was still too strong, not saucy enough if that makes sense.  I did like that the batter was crisp even under all that sauce.  It was all dark meat, but they cut it thin, like a thigh sliced 1/2 thickness," and the result was dry meat.  Way to go--you made dark meat dry.  3/103. Corn Cheese $10 """"sweet corn with creamy sauce & cheese on sizzling pan"""":  Well", I did like this but I don't think it's made to the best potential.  For one, the corn was kinda soft and dull feeling.  But the sauce and cheese were good--tons of cheese, which I appreciated.  Sweet soy sauce was decent.  6/104. Sizzling Bibimbab," Bulgogi $19.99 """"Korean style rice bowl on sizzling pan with steamed rice", seasonal sauteed veggies," fried egg and your choice of protein"""":  Expensive and boring.  I've had bibimbab at many other Korean places", and this version has the least variation of add-ins compared to others.  Side mix-ins aside, the bulbogi was kinda cheap--thin, overcooked, and just overall crappy meat.  2/105. Chicken Jjim, Soy Garlic $18.99," Add Cheese $2 """"seasoned chicken", cooked with seasonal veggies & glass noodle on sizzling plate," served with steamed rice"""":  Firstly", I want to note they got this order wrong 2x (I think?)  The first time they brought this out missing the cheese I paid $2 extra for.  The second time, I'm not sure if they got the flavor choice right (Soy Garlic?)--it just wasn't very soy saucy (compared to the fried chicken which was drowning in black tar).  I dunno.  So, I'm not sure if I've ever had this before anywhere else, but I'm not impressed.  Not sure if this is how it's usually done, but strangely this glass noodle was kinda mushy--that takes severe overcooking as glass noodle isn't as sensitive to overcooking as flour-based noodles.  Surprisingly they had far more chicken than noodles.  This is odd as chicken is more expensive.  It was kinda like eating a bowl of chicken stew of mostly chicken, and some noodles.  2/10So, bad service, bad food... but edible...2/5#sanfrancisco #koreanfood #koreancuisine #chickenjjim #bibimbap #kfc #koreanfriedchicken,It's an interesting concept of fusion, however I'm not that too into it. When you enter, you can smell the aroma of the mixed spices, and that wasn't it for me. The food was alright, the only good food was the appetizers, which were the Tofu Nuggets we had as well as the Fries. The entrees weren't really great. The service is subpar as well as everything else. 3 stars for me!,The Tonkotsu Ramen is amazing! Came here for a long overdue friend get-together and thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our dinner. Although it was busy, the service was great and the food came out relatively fast but most importantly, very good! A lot of flavor in this Korean restaurant serving the namesake dishes. 10/10,WOW. We ordered takeout from this place and I was very pleasantly surprised. -The fried chicken wings were still crispy when the food was delivered and still delicious the next day. -The noodles had the most pleasant mouthfeel and tasted good with or without the sauce that came on the side. -The chicken soup noodles were BOMB.  Takeout is hard to execute perfectly even when the dine-in experience is good, so kudos to the extra care in packaging and preparing these dishes for takeout. Need to try their pork ramen next time.,They serve the best ramen! and love their service. we went there when they were barely open and along with us, there were another 3-4  parties waiting to be seated.Great customer service, great portion size and the food was delicious. i would definitely recommend :),Really long wait but worth it. Staff is super busy, trying their best so you will want to be patient. But here's what makes an hour long wait on the weekends worth it: Sizzling bibimbap, delicious. Boneless chicken tender/wing wow delicious, sweet, caramel used, crunchy, yet tender and soft inside. Wow the cheesy corn is amazing, looks awesome for social media, great to share for parties. Supposedly the ramen broth is 12 hours and more, I wasn't a fan of added sesame to the tonkatsu but the tonkatsu ramen itself is quite amazing, really thick and flavorful. Definitely get your food with beer. The small space and decoration reminds me of Japan and Korea and good food. What's amazing is that patrons are every ethnicity and age possible. I see kids enjoying the cheesy corn and I see people on their 60s 70s bracing Covid digging into non-spicy sizzling bibimbap. I see people here who are asian and as well those who are not. Everyone seems to be having great food. But yeah hard to get seated super long wait. The staff doesn't communicate much at first, which can be frustrating, once you are seated when ordering you will see how nice they are. Turns out they are just overwhelmed and busy.,Been here few times and I love their food and service is good as usual. Definitely be back. Don't forget to try their pork belly and short rib. Is amazing.,This place was FANTASTIC. I didn't really know what to expect with Japanese Korean fusion but it all came out phenomenal. Definitely recommend the fried chicken, the bulgogi, and the bibimbap that was served in a cast iron with the perfect layer of crispy edge rice. You won't be disappointed!,I came here with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday. We started off with some hot sake. The sake was great. We all ordered our food and I ended up getting the short rib plate with a side of glass noodles. The food was amazing and everyone in my grouper enjoyed it. The inside was very nice and the service was great. Don't forget to get a soju cocktail they are good,Went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and was seated immediately. Got the karaage chicken and the bulgogi plate (+$2 for cheese). I thought that both dishes had good flavors. I am usually not a fan of chicken breast/white meat but they managed to keep it juicy which is amazing. I asked for some hot sauce to add to the bulgogi, and it went so well with the cheese and the rice. Would definitely come back!,Never leave jijime unsatisfied, the flavors are so homemade and delicious Can get busy on weekend but so worth the wait with some friends Prefer their Korean dish selection but everything is tasty on the menuNote: all the servers are very nice and remember the regulars  my sister and I can't stop coming back when we live a block and a half away,with the cutest, intimate interior to the nice waiters, this is one of my favorite hidden gems of sf! this restaurant specializes in korean asian fusion foods, all presented in the most aesthetic fashion! i took my parents here on a sunday at lunchtime and there was very little line surprisingly. we were immediately seated and helped out, and the food came out in a timely manner. while the menu has a wide range of items," the quality is superb and everything i've tried has been delicious:)-- -- --pictured:"""" veggie sizzling bibimbap ($17.95) // this was definitely delicious", with a wide array of marinated veggies over the steaming rice.

Unfortunately the egg wasn't marinated and a little harder than softboiled.Fried tofu bibimbap: The fried tofu was amazingly light and crispy, and all the ingredients were fresh,One of my go to spots, getting the short ribs + ramen together is the way to go, absolutely delicious.,We decided to revisit this Korean/Japanese restaurant. The first time was a few years back and I didn't write up a review.  It's been foggy this summer and having ramen would really hit the spot!  So we traveled to Richmond district in hopes of enjoying some comfort food.  Walking in, I noticed the tables were bunched together. The waitress did not try to separate the groups of guests from each other?!  I had to request a table near the entrance, away from others.  We're still in a pandemic and trying to be safe since the Delta variant has increased the number of cases in the Bay Area within the last few weeks.  Just thinking there should be some space between tables.  We started off with soy garlic boneless chicken wings. It had some crisp to it and seasoned just right. It's was different yet easier not having to deal with bones. Tasty appetizer!For my main course, I ordered the kuro ramen that comes with a whole egg, chewy ramen noodles, bean sprouts, 2 pieces of cha siu and green onions. The broth was rich and tasty but not too salty. It was a good balance.  The only disappointment was the egg.  I appreciate that it was a whole egg, but it was completely hard boiled.  I was expecting jammy goodness, but the yolk was even tainted green, which showed how hard boiled it was.  Maybe I got the only overcooked egg?  However, everything else was perfect in my ramen. My BF's spicy pork was a bit too sweet for him and there wasn't enough rice to finish the dish. I guess he should have order more rice. Typically, you would need a few bowls of rice due to the intensity of the sauce.  Maybe it would have helped if there was a side of kimchi to balance the sweetness.  A note for those who like to drink: In front of the restaurant, there was a sign for happy hr (4-6pm), some beers are $2.49, a large sake @ $2, and if you check-in after happy hour, you can still get 1 large sake for $2.,Visited  Jijime last weekend. When I entered, I could clearly see that this place is a neighborhood favorite, the place was packed. I was interested in their popcorn salmon and their chicken dishes. The salmon was good, but the star of the show was the chicken. The soy glazed chicken had great flavor, very tender, with a very lite crust. They used boned chicken thighs which added to the tenderness. The next time I go, I'll have to try their Bibimbap. Check them out,This place has lots of comforting food options for the cold sf weather - from ramen to stews! I got the spicy kimchi stew and a grilled pork belly plate. I think I ordered the wrong pork belly plate than I wanted as mine was very saucy with soy garlic and veggies and japchae. It was a little too salty for me so when I ran out if rice it was a little harder to eat. The stew was comforting with lots of kimchi and bean sprouts. The service was great and it wasn't too busy at night. I want to come back to try some tapas and the ramen and definitely the grilled pork belly.,I came here specifically to try the ramen. The texture of the noodles was good and reminded me of the instant ramen noodles (which I love). The broth could have had more flavor. I like spicy food, but decided to try the medium level of spice this time. It wasn't spicy at all to me. Ramen Nagi is my place of choice in the Bay Area for Ramen, as a point of reference.The fried salmon appetizer was good. It was not dry and had good texture. The croquette potato appetizer was also good. It was not too oily. Would I come here again? I don't know. Their Bi Bim Bap plates look really good, so maybe those would be more worth trying.,Went there on Friday around 1 pm and it wasn't that busy. We ordered Popcorn Salmon,  Okonomiyaki fries, beef bulgogi plate and Chicken Jjim with cheese and i ordered spicy. Popcorn salmon was ok. Nothing special.  Fries didn't not worth $10 at all. Basically it just a saggy fries with a few drop of sauce on top. The bottom basically just fries. Beef bulgogi was good and so as chicken jjim. Chicken was juicy and soft. The sauce has alittle kick to it (would be better if a little bit more spicier). Definitely better with cheese. Both entrees plates are good. I think I rather skip all the Appetizer and just order more entrees.,I think Jijime might be our new favorite Ramen spot in the city! We stopped by for an early dinner around 5pm on the Friday night after Thanksgiving. The place was about half full and we were seated right away. We started off with their house hot sake which was on the HH menu and some Popcorn Potstickers which were so cute and bite sized. I tried the Tonkotsu Sesame Ramen and the hubs had the Tonkotsu Ramen. The noodles were thin (my favorite) and perfectly cooked and the broth was so flavorful yet lean and light on oil. Most of the time when I have ramen in the US I leave feeling super heavy because of an oily or overly salty broth. Jijime was different, I ate all the noodles and drank up most of the broth, and I left the restaurant feeling great!,Small and lovely space. The fried tofu was absolutely gold. Never had chocolate tartufo before and really liked it.,Korean restaurant that also serves Japanese dishes such as ramen and takoyaki. Overall the food is good but I think it's not really an authentic Rei dish but a good one. I think bim bimbap is missing something that I usually have in Korean restaurants. Fried salmon good for us. The tofu soup is refreshing but I think it also lacks something. Chicken Jam is good. I wish that glory. The most popular dishes seem to be Bimumbap and Ramen.,JiJime is hands down the best ramen in Bay Area. This place will not disappoint! Jijime is an S.F gem!Food:  The foundation of any ramen is its broth; the broth at Jijime is filled with flavor and spices. The pork is thick and juicy, offering flavor with every bit.   The egg is cooked to perfection. Overall the ramen is rich and delicious. I highly recommend the Tonkostu sesame ramen.Atmosphere:  This is a smaller place that offers an intimate setting great for couples or anyone looking to enjoy high-quality ramen. JiJime is very aesthetically pleasing; subtle music plays in the background, adding a wonderful ambiance. The bathrooms are well kept and always clean.Service:   Best service! The service is here is phenomenal, with a warm welcome. The food comes out fast and hot!,We arrived a little after noon on a Saturday and there was one other table. There was only one waitress working but service was very prompt. The tonkatsu ramen was alright. It wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad either. It is rather basic with only wood ear, bean sprouts, and green onions as the toppings. The pork belly was really really really fat and did not have much flavor. I probably would not come back but 5 stars for the amazing service.,wow. I cannot say enough good things about Gucci Mane. This is an amazing restaurant. Great vibes delicious Ramen, 10 out of 10 would recommend!!,Great atmosphere and delicious food. We ordered the Bulgogi Quesadilla, Okonomiyaki Fries, and the Beef Potstickers. 20/10 taste all around. We sat at the bar near the back and it was cozy but had plenty of room. Great late night food.,Korean spot for dinner- ambiance was cool but food was decent. We got their most popular ramen and sizzling plate which were good but nothing too mind blowing. Prices were high for what we got, probably wouldn't come back!,I came for chicken. Chicken karaage didn't really taste chicken forward. Really rich even more so with the side of spicy mayo and really thick breading that personally hurt my mouth. Kaki fry and popcorn salmon had same breading/outer layer and spicy mayo as a sauce. Same issue of richness rather than being oyster or salmon focused. Three not really for me.Fried ika leg was more like a tempura outside that I thought was better still ok. Tofu nugget is like a tofu chicken nugget with corn kernels inside. Won't order any of these items againOrder spicy tofu stew with seafood. More seafood compared to some other places. No thank you,Korean restaurant which also serve japanese dishes like ramen and Takoyaki. Overall Food is good but I think it is not really authentic Korean dish but good. I think the bim bimbap missing something which I usually have at korean restaurant. Fried salmon us good. Tofu soup is refreshing but I think also missing something. Chicken jjim is good. I wish they torch it. Looks like the most popular dish are bimbimbap and ramen.,We had shortlisted this place as a dining option during our visit to the Golden Gate Park area, but it was hard to find, hidden past a big old tree while driving by. We ordered a number of appetizers (the raw octopus one being the absolute highlight!) and entrees we had an assortment like the chicken jijim, bibimbap, beef short ribs.We finished off with the chocolate tartufo and chocolate bears for dessert. All the dishes were amazing and service was excellent.,Wanted to try a new restaurant and found this had great reviews! And was affordable for the City.It was also popular when we arrived at around 6:15pm on a Saturday.The menu had a lot of options to choose from with their small plate appetizers and lots of entree options.Started off with the popcorn salmon which was a real treat, never tried salmon bites like this before!I had the bulgogi marinated beef, which was a little sweet but very good.  Liked the combination with the glass noodles.Partner had the spicy pork bibimbap (because they were out of their pork belly already) which was also very good and flavorful.Everything felt clean and safe and the serves wear gloves.  Vaccination required also helped give me peace of mind, as there is no special spacing between parties.Looking forward to coming back again.,I was hesitant to try their ramen as i was skeptical about a place that doesn't only specialize in ramen. But, i was craving ramen and soup and my boyfriend was craving protein and basically anything that isn't soup so we compromised here! I ordered the Kuro Ramen extra spicy as a request and it was sooo good! The server even gave me extra powder on the side in case it wasn't spicy enough and I really appreciated it! (And added more haha). My bf got the spicy pork bowl, and he really enjoyed it. Overall very good place! Would definitely recommend and can't wait to come back and try some of their other dishes that look so yummy!The service was also really good, they were attentive and very nice. We went an hour before closing and they still accommodated us! Also the pricing is extremely reasonable!,Was in the area and saw their chicken Jjim on Yelp and wanted to give it a try. Was able to place an order online. It's hard to find parking in the area so had to circle around a few times. The restaurant is pretty small and was pretty packed. There were also people waiting outside. I added cheese on the Spicy Chicken Jjim, which complemented the spicy chicken jjim well. We also got soy garlic boneless fried chicken. It was very flavorful, maybe a bit too flavorful. I will come back for the spicy chicken jjim.,We've been here twice and it is just the perfect way to end a active day and warm your bones to some great kimchi tofu soup w /  French fries ,  bi bum bop , and a sake or a beer . very casual , reasonably priced , low-key and in a not too busy part of town where you might actually find parking.Go for happy hour and get a Yelp check in special large sake.,We all enjoyed the food. Wish we would have seen they close at 9 before we went though. Felt a bit pushed out of the door when we were already the last table at 8:45,Sizzling bibimbap didn't come out sizzling and was kinda bland but everything else were flavorful.  Loved the chicken jjim with melted cheese (came out sizzling!) and Okonomiyaki fries!  Prices are reasonable.  Will be back to try other dishes.,Excellent place to eat. Service was excellent my water glass was never empty. Food was high quality and came sizzling to your table. Ramen Broth was thick and rich.,The family and I have been eating at Jijime since it opened.  The food is outstanding.  My favorite is the spicy pork sizzling bibimbap, which is bursting with flavors than it is spicy!  I also highly recommend the pork belly plate, and bulgolgi plate.  To start, we usually order the side salad and boneless fried chicken (soy garlic or spicy).  My kids enjoy the tonkatsu ramen.  Mouth already watering as I think of the food!!At the beginning, we frequented Jijime weekly...we enjoyed the food and also the service was great!!  Pam and Chris were out favorite servers!!  Sadly for us, the restaurant became really popular.and really busy!!Covid messed up our weekly visits, but we are truly relieved that the restaurant survived.  I am happy to see Pam return to the front of the house.  We will continue to dine at Jijime.The noise level has definitely increased since people have returned to dine-in, which is the only downside.. I don't understand why these millennials and GenZ'ers think it's ok to shout at each other just so they can be heard...but maybe it's just me!  Lol!,I'd give this 4.5 if I could. I came here with and old friend for the ramen, but when we saw the offerings we split a hefty meal. We got:- popcorn pot stickers- popcorn salmon- okonomiyaki fries- 2 tonkotsu ramen- 2 beers- sake- mango pana cottaThe tapas were fantastic. The pot stickers were crisp and flavorful. The salmon was breaded and fried in panko, making them wonderfully crispy. They paired fantastically with the fries for a truly interesting spin on fish and chips. If I'd been there alone, the tapas would have been more than enough of a meal for me on their own.But it's been a long time since I tried out a new ramen spot and it's been a bit of a mission of mine to check out as many as I can throughout the bay, so my main focus is that: the tonkotsu ramen.Given that this is an Asian fusion spot and not exclusively ramen-centric, I was curious how it would turn out. I was happy to discover that it was above average.The chashu is the star (get extra). They're not traditional rolled pork belly, but long, tender strips. Very good stuff.The broth is also excellent, although a bit sweeter than I'm used to. Not to the point where it's a problem, but it was noticeable.The noodles were above average. Not super special, but clearly not cheap either.The egg was unfortunate; plain white eggs, not even marinated and definitely not soft boiled. Definitely disappointing.Overall," a better bowl than I was expecting and definitely above average; better than """"acceptable"," but not """"exceptional.""""The mango pana cotta was a great way to tie up the experience. Between the two of us", the meal was only ~$85 before tip. Not bad for a fresh, interesting, delicious, and satisfying experience. There are other places I'd recommend if you're looking exclusively for ramen, but there's no questioning the overall quality of the menu. I'll definitely be back to try out the bibimbap sometime, as that seemed to be more of a specialty of theirs.,Jijime was crowded on a Monday night. Some other restaurants on this block were closed and they might have benefited from the spill over. I had their bulgogi quesadilla $10 and kuro (black garlic) ramen $14. The quesadilla was good, not great. It could have used a small side of kimchi to give it a bit more excitement. The black garlic ramen's broth was lackluster. I could tell they spent some time on it but it was not rich enough. The black garlic oil was weak and I had much better kuro ramen elsewhere in San Francisco and Mountain View. Since the restaurant was busy, the service was adequate. My bill was $30 with tax and tip.,Decided to try this place out and made a reservation on a Sunday during lunchtime. The space inside is pretty small and cozy with bench seating on one side and separate tables on the other. One server working the whole time but very attentive and cleared plates and refilled waters consistently. Pork Belly Salad - layers of crisp lettuce, kimchi, cherry tomatoes, and slices of pork belly with a sprinkle of scallions. Super refreshing and a pretty filling snack. Okonomiyaki Fries - saw all the pictures for this and knew I had to try it! Fries were nice and crispy (no soggy fries!) + the sauce and toppings reminded me so much of okonomiyaki. Not my favorite but flavors were there. Crispy Fried Seaweed Roll - I had low expectations for this since the description was pretty simple but had to be my favorite! Crisp on the outside but chewy on the inside. Came with a dipping sauce (soy based). Mango Panna Cotta - only 4 desserts on the menu and this one looked the most refreshing and yummy (to my eyes at least). Smooth texture (no rubbery feel or pudding holes) and the mango sauce on top paired nicely with the panna cotta that was lightly flavored with almond extract (or I think I tasted almond). Will definitely come back and try the other items on the menu!,I love this place. The service was great and food was so very delicious. I had the sizzling bibimpop with tofu. It was out of this world. I can't wait for my next bibimpop dish!,My sister and brother-in-law brought me to their favorite local spot, Jijime, in the Richmond District and I thoroughly enjoyed all of the dishes I tried. Will definitely be back again!,Amazing food, fast service, and reasonably priced for SF. Especially enjoyed the tapas. Wish they had beer on tap rather than in bottles.,Excellent food here. It took longer than desired to get our food once we had placed the order, but it was well worth the wait! I'd come back here and try to make their happy hour.,Okay I can't recommend Jijime enough! It's right around the corner from my new apartment and I have become a REGULAR! Always have to have the bulgogi bibimbap and corn cheese, + a little yogurt soju,Get here now and try this food. Super small intimate and cute. Fast friendly service. Very clean and I really appreciate the fact that if you have questions and I'll answer them. We really enjoyed our meal and I can't wait to come back. Everything was good super filling very tasty flavorful,JIJIME has solid food that hits the spot for a night out with friends but it is a bit pricy for what you get. the flavors are good and the space has a nice vibe for dinner. service was normal but there wasnt anything special about the food to justify the price.,The best ramen place I've ever been. I've never tasted such an amazing variety of amazing stuff,A friend and I walked in on a Wednesday night around 7 pm and were seated immediately at an indoor table. Drinks: We had 2 large hot sakes for a steal! They were $5 each and bottled Sapporo and Asahi. They didn't have draft. Food: We decided to get multiple apps and one large main to share. We treated ourselves to Popcorn Salmon, Tako Wasabi, Pork Belly Salad," and Jjim Chicken. The salmon was perfectly crispy paired with spicy mayo. The Tako Wasabi is one of my favorite """"beer snack"""" foods. Every time I see it on the menu and get it and as long as you are okay with raw octopus and wasabi flavors you'll love it! The pork belly salad was okay... I think the combination of greens", sweet kimchi, and the pork belly wasn't for me. The soy garlic Jjime chicken with cheese was good but not great. It was much saucier than I expected. The servers were really polite and attentive and we were able to linger until closing without feeling rushed. I'd like to go back to try the Bibimpap and Ramen.,This place was delicious. We came at the right time around 1700ish, wasn't a wait until about 1 hour later then more people started waiting outside for a table. It's a small place," 2 servers....but very efficient in getting your order/meal/check as fast as they could. They were working extremely hard. Food quality was very good as well. No complaints.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tanglad,"An extra star for the comfort and warmth brought to me on a rainy, cold evening by a bowl of hearty rich soup? Maybe, but I think there was more to this romance than a shelter from the storm. The broth was sturdy on its own so I didn't add the condiments until I was down to the last noodles. The chicken never made it to the hot tub.  It was so succulent I ate it separately.The service was prompt and professional.  The price was very fair.This is my second trip.  The first time I had something else and it was meh so I didn't Yelp it.  However, this time, winner winner...,After searching on Yelp for foods in the Castro, I settled on Tanglad.  There apparently are lots of Vietnamese spots in the Castro, and this one was the highest rated.We ordered the Bun Rieu and the Garlic noodles with five spice chicken.  Garlic Noodles were amazing!!!  10/10 the high heat sear was apparent in each bite of noodles.  The meat was pretty good.Bun Rieu was very tomato-y which was tasty but not super authenticWould come back if in the area!,CAVEAT:  This review is only valid for vegans.  If you are an omnivore please ignore as this review does not apply to you. LOL. I visited Tanglad with a friend while strolling through the Castro.  It was a cold fall day and the thought of some hot soup was like a warm cozy blanket.  We were seated immediately and the staff was incredibly friendly and efficient.  I've been sticking to my vegan diet this year so I asked the server what vegan options there were, and the response was a bit confusing, but it seemed like the vegetable soup was the only option?  Regardless, the soup is what I ordered!  The bowl was big and came out steaming hot!  There were a bunch of fresh veggies and a couple pieces of tofu, unfortunately the broth itself tasted like nothing.  I guess I was thinking it was going to be a veggie pho with all the aromatics (ginger, onion, cinnamon, cardamom, coriander, star anise) and maybe some vegan fish sauce.  Instead it was more like they took some unsalted veggie stock and added some French's crispy fried onions.  Also, the plate of bean spouts and basil was tiny and sad--one little wilted pieced of Thai basil.  There was no amount of hoisin or sriracha that could save this bowl of ""soup"". TLDR:  If you are vegan you should probably try to find another place to grab some food!,This is a great Vietnamese spot. The staff is super friendly. The restaurant itself is nice, with sufficient seating and a lovely open air area in the front. They do delivery well, too. Their pho broth is super flavorful - lots of star anise. Their combination banh mi is one of my favorites in the city - the bread is excellent, very light and crunchy like I would get when in Vietnam. Not a heavy, dense French roll like a lot of places use. Their Vietnamese coffee is also awesome - they make it from scratch / pour over to order. Prices are very fair, in my opinion. Definitely one of the top 3 or 5 spots in the Castro, to boot.,Love that they have both bo bun hue and bun rieu. I ordered their bun rieu and really enjoyed it. Good amount of meats/toppings to soup and noodle ratio. It was tangy, seafoody, and very filling.  Service was attentive and friendly. Food came out super quick. Overall the ambiance was a nice balance of a classic old school Vietnamese restaurant with a newer swankier Vietnamese restaurant.,Everything I ordered here was delicious. The garlic noodles are top notch with great flavor. The Pho ga was amazing. It was one of the best I ever had. The imperial roll was yummy. This is a great place for Vietnamese food.,decently priced vietnamese food with large portions - friend ordered the pork vermicelli and had more than enough in leftovers and i ordered the pork bahn mi, which was delicious! great casual, quick service spot for lunch in the castro,This place is way nicer than the pictures  online make it seem! It's actually a super cute vibe and has a pretty outdoor area. The food was amazing as well!! The noodles with chicken had sooo much flavor. I loved then. My friend loved their Pho as well!I forgot my sunglasses and I just called and they held them for me. Staff was super nice.,Mildly seasoned 5-spice chicken and garlic noodles. The lemongrass beef was very well seasoned. I preferred the lemongrass beef  over the 5-spice chicken.The crispy imperial rolls were very good. I will order this again.,The Castro is not really a destination for the best food in San Francisco, but since this was the area that I was spending time in I decided to look up where to get food that was also vegan friendly. Tanglad had great Yelp reviews and is also centrally located in a fun part of The Castro. There were three clearly labeled vegetarian options on the menu: Vegetarian Spring Rolls (vegan), Vegetarian Noodle Soup (vegan) and Vegetarian Sandwich (vegan if you request no mayo). I decided to get the Vegetarian Spring Rolls to eat at the restaurant and the Vegetarian Sandwich (requested vegan) to eat later in the day. The Vegetarian Spring Rolls were good, but not great and there were a few things about them I would have preferred differently. First of all there were hot mushrooms in them and while I would have preferred those in another dish, I like the contents of my fresh rolls to be completely cold. They were also cut up into pieces which made them harder to eat and I would have preferred for it be served whole and that way I can dunk it into the sauce myself. The Vegetarian Sandwich came on bread that was slightly stale and dry and the bread could have definitely been more fresh. The contents of the sandwich besides the bread was pretty good, but it would have been nice to have vegan mayonnaise available for the sandwich.One of the best parts of my experience here was the outdoor dining with a covered roof were you could look out onto the street. I could see myself coming back here for that alone and trying the Vegetarian Noodle Soup if I came back.,So glad I found this place on Yelp. I'm a major fan of pho and Tanglad did not disappoint. Service was great and food came out quickly. I tried the seafood pho. Some of the best tasting broth I've had. Love the addition of veggies (carrots, bok choy, broccoli), something you don't often see with seafood pho. Highly recommend!,A solid Vietnamese restaurant that gives you few dish options but each option is stellar in its own ways. FOODThe dishes here are spectacular. My friends and I ordered 3 phos and 1 garlic noodle. The phos' broth is insanely good. It's just the right amount of saltiness and seasoning to make you want more but it doesn't make you dread for water as soon as you step out the door. All 3 phos has good amount of meat in it and what I liked mine (Bun Rieu) is that it had good amount of veggies in the soup as well. On top of that, since the Bun Rieu was tomato based, it did not taste acidic at all! Highly recommend if you are someone who gets acidic easily. We also ordered the Thai Iced Tea as well. It was sweetened to the right amount and doesn't make you feel like you're drinking corn syrup from the nozzle. SERVICEThe service overall is pretty decent. The servers never check up on us during our meal. We had to wave them down to get some waters. On top of that, we ordered Vietnamese coffee that didn't come out until the end of our meal. We had to go to next door's coffee shop to get an actual coffee cup to take the coffee to go. ALL IN ALL, this is a solid Vietnamese food spot with great selections. Do make sure to ask for your drinks to be prepped well before your food arrives!TIPS- don't sit in their outdoor seating at night, there are a lot of mosquitoes that hides in the outdoor plants- order your drinks first and ask them to deliver it asap.,Tanglad Ratings: 3.9/5Food: 3.75/5 - My boyfriend and I decided to get Vietnamese again for dinner, because he was craving for some five spice chicken with broken rice that I had from An Chi the night before. We both agree that this place was not as good as An Chi, and pretty mediocre compared to the Viet places we been to in Richmond area despite the high ratings. You can see the descriptions of the items we got below. - Roasted Five-Spice Chicken [GET]: The chicken thigh was roasted nicely with a nice glazed on top of it, however, could be a bit more charred. It was meaty, thick, and tender, but it wasn't as juicy as the ones I got the night before. Chicken was well-marinated and savory though. My boyfriend enjoyed it, and the rice as well. He got broken rice, and it was fluffy and chewy, so we approve of the rice. The veggies, especially the pickled daikon added a nice acidity to the dish. - Grilled Pork and Imperial Rolls [GET]: The grilled pork is thinly sliced with good flavors, but I wish it was more flavorful. It was definitely not as juicy or tender like how I wanted it to be. The highlight of this dish was the imperial rolls, and it comes with three mini ones. The filling was packed with pork and veggies, tasted almost like a meatball. Flavors was interestingly good, but in a good way, and I really liked it. Vermicelli noodles was great and nicely cooked, and the texture works well with the fresh veggies on the side. Make sure to mix it with the sauce they provided. Ambiance: 4/5 - I walked past Tanglad before many times. It is an authentic Asian and Vietnamese restaurant located in Castro. Castro is great, busy, bussing, and the entire street is packed with pretty décor and colors. Interior looks pretty spacious and had a nice dining space for both indoor and outdoor seating available. We did not dine-in, because we got take-out, but ambiance seems like a great place to grab some dinner with friends or going on a causal date with a SO. Price: 4/5 - My boyfriend ordered DoorDash, and our orders came up to be around $25 for the both of us. I believe he had some discount codes for it, and he treated me to dinner again. The roasted five-spice chicken and the grilled pork with imperial rolls was both around $13. Prices were definitely average compared to other Viet and nearby restaurants in Castro. Portions are slightly smaller, and I wasn't entirely full after the meal, but overall it was okay. Service: 4/5 - We ordered take-out, so didn't really get the full experience of the indoor dining experience, however, the online ordering process was smooth and seamless. The food came here fairly quick, and got our order was correct, so we were pretty satisfied with our dinner at home. BLUF: The rice noodles dish and rice platters are all pretty average and prices were standard here. If you are craving for Vietnamese food in Castro, then give Tanglad a try. I would say it is a safe bet for you for most dishes. I recommend the imperial rolls and the five spice roasted chicken dish if you can't decide what to get. I probably will not return again, and will explore the Richmond area more for Viet food.,The banh mi was huge! It came in a box which was super surprising because I've always just received it in a white paper. Now this might be a good marketing strategy because now whenever we crave a Vietnamese sandwich, we'll say ""let's order that giant tasty banh mi that came in a box!"" The baguette was very crispy. But not to the point where it would cut the top of my mouth like other baguettes would. The filling was generous. The breads wouldn't even close all the way... but then again, the baguette was pretty narrow so it wouldn't fit everything. The lemongrass beef and pork belly were amazing!!! The 5 spice chicken didn't have much flavor. The chicken was also dry. However I still think they deserve 5 stars for the fast service and abundance of filling!,I can't tell you how disappointed we were with our meal. The chicken pictured was so raw and disgusting my friend's 14 year old grandson literally gagged and said ""it looks like a heart. I'm not eating that."" The garlic noodles were wet and cold. The grilled shrimp was ok and the spring rolls were ok. The veggie bahn mi was bland. The carrots were shredded not pickled. The tofu was bland. Overall it was a terrible meal...and they said we had to deal with ubereats to get any sort of refund. No real apology for the heinous food.,I ordered take-out from this place via DoorDash, and had high expectations for the food since I know it's a neighborhood staple in the Castro. We tried two different types of pho, and the broth was very good & included all the usual toppings. My only complaint is that the meat included was either not good quality or significantly undercooked--so I did not eat that part. If I order from here again I will definitely try something different.,Ordered via Doordash - my coworker wanted to give this place a try, and I was willing to give it a second chance. I ordered the beef and imperial roll vermicelli bowl and thai tea. The thai tea was sweet and what'd you expect. The portion size for the vermicelli bowl was decent, but the beef was completely burnt and that was all the flavor you really get. The vegetables were withered and dry.,After trying so many banh mi spots in the city, the pork banh mi from here is hands down my favorite. Their pho is also solid, but something about their pate and pork really shines. This is a homey spot for Vietnamese food in the Castro, perfect for a cozy night or delivery.,Good food, a nice dinning space, attentive service, and fair pricing, yea Tangland is a nice option to have in the Castro. Okay Parking, it's not ideal but I have always found a spot within a block or two of the strip. As for the space it's not overly crowded, but you can expect the dinning space to get busy given that it's a nice option for anyone that wants to dine after 8pm. As for my meal, I ordered to much food, but did enjoy a Grilled Lemongrass Beef Sandwich tonight that was tasty, and packed with meat and veg. It was a very filling, and well composed sandwich with the beef being well seasoned and tender. I also ordered a Pho, but that's in the fridge, fyi it had a generous amount of noodles and will be enjoyed another day. Overall it was a good experience, plus it's nice to know that Tangland is a great option for dinning in.,I was fortunate enough to live in Vietnam for a month.  Phô was my hands down favorite...there were days I ate it for every meal!!This place has all the flavors I'd expect!!  The broth is rich and subtly sweet in the way I remember!!  Friendly service.  Great location.  Not too crowded on a Sunday!!!,This was a pleasant surprise hidden out in the Castro. My husband and I stopped in on a whim, and we're very glad we did.The restaurant had a semi-outdoor space with a beautiful view of the Castro. It made for some fantastic people-watching. We would come back here just for that. I had the Garlic Noodles with the Five Spice Chicken.  The chicken was juicy and tender and really complimented the dish. I always believe that the best way to judge a dish is if it stands on its own, without any additional sauces or spices. I didn't even so much as want any salt. What impressed us most of all was the service. I was amazed at how fast the food came out - it barely felt like five minutes from order to table (though to be fair, this lunch was on an early Tuesday afternoon). The waiters were very attentive and constantly checked in on us. We're already looking forward to coming back the next time we're in the Castro.,Aesthetic restaurant, quick service, and super kind staff. The food is AMAZING and flavorful. Noodles had so much chicken and veggies - made for a very filling dinner. They also have hoisin sauce & sriracha tableside to amp things up. Definitely will be coming back to try the pho!,The pho broth was a little on the salty side. The mix of beef products was less varied than combinations at other traditional places. Noodles were alright. Service was good and efficient. It's in the middle of Castro so good people watching if that's a goal, otherwise the atmosphere was fine for a quick lunch.,If you want authentic Vietnamese food, this is not it. We gave this place a try because of the high reviews on Yelp; but it was a disappointment. We got pho, bun Rieu, and bun Bo hue; the bun bo hue doesn't even have the correct noodle- they use pho noodle instead of the large vermicelli noodle. Taste is pretty bland for all 3 dishes and they barely give you any fresh  veggies to go with the dish. Service is meh so I don't really see myself coming back.,Ordered takeout from here after seeing the many positive reviews - vegetarian pho for myself and five-spice chicken pho for my husband. Additionally, veggie spring rolls. We asked for the chicken pho to be spicy and they delivered - added habanero pepper slices in the broth and it was very flavorful but so spicy! The vegetarian pho was ok, the broth didn't scream flavor but it was edible. The spring rolls were a little disappointing because the rice paper wrapper was so chewy and I had to discard that and eat the fillings as salad.Overall, not sure if I would try Tanglad again.,You can always count on vietnamese food to fill the trifecta of food (cheap, quantity and tasty). This place was no exception to that rule. We got the bun bo hue and pork vermicelli. They kind of do unique spins to the dishes. The bun bo hue used pho noodles and had a less fishy taste. The vermicelli had iceberg lettuce in it. My only feedback is the eggrolls. They were kinda bland and could use more seasoning in the meat itself. Maybe more sugar, fish sauce?,Delicious cuisine. I only wish they served alcohol. Would return for the excellent food and timely service. Great weeknight dinner spot in the heart of the Castro.,I don't normally think of the Castro as a destination for Vietnamese food, so I didn't have Little Saigon or Slanted Door level expectations.  It's reasonably priced and good alternative to diner-type food nearby.  But it was just ""OK"", as Yelp denotes for their 3-star level.Garlic Noodles w/ Pork (+Extra Noodles): So I actually ordered a pork chop.  The person at the register confirmed that I meant a pork chop with bone and I said yes.  The receipt even said pork chop.  Yet when I got home, I found it was just regular old pork slices.  And they were a bit soggy, like stir-fried, instead of that nice crisp grill texture.  The veggies felt like the kind you get at a Chinese fast food restaurant.  The garlic noodles were more like garlicky lo mein; a far cry from the intensely umami and springy garlic noodles you'd get at Crustacean.  It was a very mediocre dish on many levels.Grilled Lemongrass Beef and Imperial Roll Vermicelli: So the beef here was the highlight.  It was cut thin, heavily marinated and had that dry smoky grilled texture.  Really delish.  Only downside was that the portion was kinda skimpy.  Same with the imperial roll, which was just 3 small pieces.  And the skin on the roll wasn't all that crispy.  Meanwhile, the rice noodles and fresh veggies were pretty standard.,Really tasty spring rolls here, I love that they include both shrimp and the hammy meat (always forget what it's called) in the roll. Of course can't forget the fried egg roll skin to bring all the textures together. It was ready within 10 minutes as a to-go order.,Ordered through ubereats and they forgot a lot of side items we paid for extra. Also jalapenos and lemons, basil, etc were missing.,First I thought it was called Tangoland.Next I thought it was called Tangland.It wasn't until the end of my meal that I realized the place is called Tanglad, the Vietnamese word for Lemongrass.  How about we just call it quite good?  Castro Street was ripe for fresh, colorful, and flavorful Vietnamese fare, and Tanglad has that covered.  Lemon Beef with Vermicelli and Imperial Rolls (about $15) was 100% delicious and very filling.  I spotted another dish on the table of someone else dining on the front patio and had to comment on how pretty it looked; this version of Vietnamese food seems more attractively presented than what you'll find elsewhere, owing largely to all of those fresh, colorful vegetables.  Service was as service is these days meaning totally basic.  I walked in to ask for a table and menu, a server took my order and brought me my food, and I went back inside to pay when I was done.  Nobody checked on me or asked if I needed anything (I didn't, in fact), and the presence inside of uncleared tables told me the they may be struggling to adequately staff.  That said, what the kitchen puts out more than adequately makes up for the basic service levels provided.  Welcome to the Castro, Tanglad.  I've no doubt I'll be back.,This is the Healthiest and most reasonably priced restaurant in the Castro! I wish they stay open later (minus .5 stars for closing early, jk) I love Pho and Veggie sandwiches. My neighbourhood is not know for vegetarian options or healthy food but this place meets my needs perfectly:) my friends who ""hate tofu"" even think the veggie sandwich is delicious. The only problem with this place if you're a local is, there is always someone you know in here so you have to say hi to everyone before you sit down. Also, the regular lady who is like our Castro Aunty has been on vacation and her son is doing a terrific job! (Give him a raise, haha) honestly they are and family and they treat the customers like family, too:),Ooo this place is goodBest garlic noodle chicken in the cityProtip: ask for an egg on top,Got the garlic noodles and the pho. The pho was fantastic! ReAlly flavorful and nice spicy rice flavor. The meat was dank.The garlic noodles were decent. It wish it had more garlic flavor but was tasty.,TL;DR - I'm Vietnamese and Tanglad is delicious!I love this place. I've ordered Doordash and also had my fiance get take away for me! Their banh mi sandwiches, while more expensive than say Tenderloin or Sunset/Richmond, are absolutely authentic and delicious. The only thing is they do use white people mayo ha.I also ate their garlic noodles and it was soooo flavorful. They don't short you on the seasoning, it coats every noodle.I want to come for their bun rieu, which is my favorite soup and something I've made at home too. So far, I recommend Tanglad for folks who are homesick Vietnamese or people who've visited Vietnam.,I love the hue style beef and pork noodles soup. Always get this and Vietnamese coffee. Staff also friendly.,After a beautiful stairs walk in Dolores Heights we were hungry and looked forward to trying a new restaurant (for us) in the area.  Yelp to the rescue! Tanglad popped up on my search and boy were we pleased with this place. We were greeted warmly as we walked in and told we could choose any place to sit. There is a lovely semi-enclosed patio in front which we chose that provided fresh air and great people watching! There was a living plant wall that was lovely. Being a vegetarian, the Veggie Spring Roll appealed to me and it was hands down the best I've tried. Multiple ingredients inside including mushrooms, tofu & crispy rice noodles. My two friends each ordered a noodle dish- one with pork & the other with beef. They agreed it was most flavorful & the meat incredibly tender. Our Vietnamese Ice Coffees were refreshing and delicious.,We needed to find a reasonably priced fast casual restaurant before heading to a concert tonight and we ended up finding this unexpectedly solid Vietnamese restaurant in the Castro for a quick and tasty dinner ! Once again our YELP colleagues steered us correctly. We ended up with the Hue Beef and Pork Pho - the broth was tasty and it was generously portioned ($15), the Grilled Lemongrass Beef and Imperial Rolls ($15.25) which was also a generous bowl of cold noodles, various greens and tasty beef with three Imperial rolls, and the excellent Grilled Pork Garlic Noodles ($16.50) with an added fried egg (which we could have skipped IMHO for $2 more). Lots of food, all tasty and uniquely flavored and seemingly quite authentic. We will be back when in the area. Well done !,Best Vietnamese in the city! We usually get a excellent Pho (#11), but also try their sandwiches. Friendly. Quick. Super relaxing. We come here weekly!,The sandwiches were super yummy. Service was friendly. Vegan and vegetarian options made me happy. Spring rollSauce was very nice,Best Vietnamese food I have had in a long time. I got the vegetarian bahn mi sandwich and some noodle soup. This was yesterday at lunch time. The man at the front was super nice and attentive!,I passed by here every time I'm in the area, and I'm so glad I stopped in! First, I love the wall of plants that is on your right when you enter - but the win came from the food and service, which were superb. I felt like the price was actually quite a bargain for the quality of food and portions.,Stopped in near closing and they were kind enough to serve me a combo pho right quick.  I had heard mixed reviews of some of their other menu items, but this was fantastic:  deeply flavorful broth, tender slices of tendon, brisket, and so on.I'll be back!,I ordered the five spice chicken garlic noodles and bun rieu via doordash. The bun rieu was pretty good, but different from other bun rieu we've had. The menu lists shrimp cake in the bun rieu which we asked to put on the side since my fiancé is allergic to shrimp. It was great that they followed those instructions. However, we weren't aware that there was also boiled shrimp in it..It was also interesting that there was cabbage in it which we thought changed the taste of the broth and made it taste less like other bun rieus we've had and more like a tomato noodle soup. There was also barely any of the crab and pork meatball. I was not bad, but didn't taste like the usual bun rieu.The garlic noodles came in a takeout box that was smushed because of the material of the box and the steam. It didn't hold well. The garlic noodles didn't really taste like regular garlic noodles, but more like chow mein. It didn't have much garlic flavor to it and also included veggies you find in chow mein like cabbage, carrots and broccoli. It was also really oily and the bottom of the takeout container was drenched in oil :/ the meat was tender but also wasn't like the usual 5 spice chicken we've had.,I went in around 8:20 PM on a Tuesday, and there were not many people. I sat down right away. I ordered a Pho and a pork belly sandwich on their simple Menu. Really, the food came out faster than it took me to decide. The sandwich was so good I had to order a second one to go for breakfast. The Pho was delicious as well, and I almost couldn't stop drinking most of the soup. The service was nice and friendly. They actually make eye contact. I will come again.,They just opened. But still super friendly, menu was simple and traditional.  I was looking for the shanking beef but they took it off the menu along time ago... we ordered the dacbiet and was yum yummy! It was cold to that help alot!  I would come back... parking is just hard luck I have comercial plates...,came here with 5 friends and every single one of us liked it!! we got 2 bowls of pho, pork vermicelli, 5 spice chicken rice dish, banh mi, and garlic noodles. every single one was absolutely scrumptious. it's very conveniently located near the castro muni station, service is friendly, and food is amazing! please check out if you're in the area!,My go-to place for Vietnamese in the neighborhood! I typically call to order lunch on a weekday and it's usually a 15 minute wait which is the perfect amount of time for me to walk over. I've gotten their vermicelli bowls as well as the banh mi and they're both super tasty. I wish there was some herbs in the vermicelli bowls like thai basil or mint that would add an extra level of flavor-- I will probably ask for some next time! When it comes to banh mi, I always get the combo, my mom prefers the beef, and my dad prefers the grilled pork. We all prefer getting our banh mi here over dinosaur, so much tastier. Staff here is also super nice! I usually arrive before my food is done and am always offered a seat to wait and a cup of water or hot tea!,LOVEGreat calamariLIKEGood phoPatio seating,This place's garlic noodles has a distinctly different flavor profile than most Vietnamese garlic noodle joints in the city.  I usually order their veggie noodle soup which is generous and hits the spot.  Their imperial rolls are just ok, as is the papaya salad.  Also tried the lemongrass banh mi which is pretty on-point, good ingredients all around.  Most of all I like that this place is affordable and high-quality.  It's a great alternative to some of my more preferred but pricier spots.  It's easy on the budget. :),I'm a bit confused by all the positive reviews. Maybe I came on an off day? Ordered the crispy imperial rolls and the wrapper wasn't cooked all the way through so it was gummy/chewy and not crispy. Hubby ordered the the roasted five spice chicken.  The skin was not cooked well enough and was rubbery. Everything was unsatisfying but we were starving and just needed fuel. Maybe we would have been better off ordering soup.,Love everything I've tried so far, and looking forward to eating more off their extensive menu. Genie helped me place a large order of spring rolls for a party, and modified the portions exactly to my requests. She even included individual sauce bowls for serving! Everything was so thoughtfully and professionally done.The spring rolls were a huge hit with all 7 trained chefs in attendance, and made hosting easy on me. Highly recommending Tanglad to everyone I know!,LOVE THE GARLIC NOODLES. 100% MUST GET.Be careful with ordering the spring rolls online via doordash tho- it says you can opt for a vegetarian option but there isn't a button to click to opt in, and my comment to have them be vegetarian was ignored unfortunately,I'm so glad I decided to give this place another try! I was a little hesitant at first, but I'm so glad I did! We had gotten pork chop over garlic noodles and shrimp spring rolls. The pork chop was filled with flavor and the pork chop was SO juicy! The garlic noodles were also jam packed with flavor. We're definitely going to be coming back to try more!,Tanglad was actually really good, didn't know what to expect since a friend brought me but definitely loved it and hope to come back soon again.,I ordered the lemon grass beef noodles and lemon grass beef bahnmi. A little on the greasy side, but overall tasty -- juicy with a good balance of meaty and fresh for the banhmi and nice amount broccoli for the noodles to make a while balanced meal.,Very solid spot for pho and Viet sandwiches.I zipped through Tanglad's menu selecting a few items so I could ""comprehensively write about their food.""Who am I kidding? I was greedy and we were both starving!I'm glad that I ordered across the menu as we tried 2 appetizers (fried calamari and imperial rolls), a 5-spice chicken sandwich with pate plus pho with rare beef and meatballs.All but the imperial rolls were executed perfectly, the rolls being a little rubbery. I think delivery may have impacted the texture somewhat yet I didn't detect any delicious shatter in the roll. The star was the Viet sandwich- heaven! My son and I split the pho and sandwich and with every bite, we groaned with pleasure. Now I know exactly what Cherlynn N writes about regarding a good Viet sandwich's meat to bread ratio; she'd likely give Tanglad's a big thumbs-up.With regard to delivery, Tanglad needs to separate the Thai basil and bean sprouts from the hot food items: They were deeply wilted with whatever other greens were in there into a sad, soggy pile. I wish they'd been popped into a bag with the Thai iced teas we ordered. Overall, we really enjoyed our meal & look forward to doing takeout again very soon.,Another winner here in my book because this place have Pho, BBH and Bun Rieu!  It's already very difficult to find a place that serve bun rieu in SF if you know what I am talking about and to even find one that's half decent is almost non existent. I am so happy that they make all three noodle soup well (yes I ordered all three for myself just to test it out). The food here taste like homemade and all the ingredients are super fresh.  They don't skimp on meat and I must say the portion is very good as well. I plan to come back and try your other dishes by dinning in! See you soon!,This place deserves 10 stars! We sat, ordered, and five minutes later, fresh deliciousness was served by our very friendly waitress. The Hue Noodle Soup is a MUST. It is the best I have ever had, with tender slices of meat and an incredibly flavorful broth that you will want to slurp down.

cken with spring rolls vermicelli is also very tasty and the greens are super fresh. These dishes honestly reminded me of flavors of home--will def take my family here when they visit. I suggest you do the same!,Tried this new place based on low# of reviews, but all were 5 star, and so is mine!! Take out (obviously) 2 banh mi sandwiches - 1 lemongrass pork, 1 5 spice chicken. The sandwiches were juicy, tasty and delicious! The pho was very authentic and also delicious - hearty portions of meat and noodles ... Top grade food and a brave owner to start in October,I recommend the garlic noodles. I usually get prawns, but have also done the chicken. Haven't actually eaten here in person, but have gotten takeout multiple times. Have tried several things in the menu. Didn't give it five stars because we tried a couple things we didn't like. One was an appetizer with a peanut sauce.,So glad I found this little gem in my neighborhood! Before coming across Tanglad, I was making frequent treks over to the Outer Sunset to get my Pho fix.  I appreciate that they give you the option of white or dark meat when ordering Pho Ga, as I'm not a huge fan of dark meat. Their veggie spring rolls are also probably the best I've had in SF! If I could give them an extra star for their amazing, green patio I would. A whole wall covered in live plants?! Count me in.,** The following review reflects my outdoor dining experience DURING the COVID-19 pandemic. **I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised by this unexpected Vietnamese place in the heart of the Castro. This space used to house the decidedly mediocre Slurp Noodle where its pan-Asian menu didn't allow any particular dish to stand out. It was Fork before that and Fuzio before that, so there have been plenty of F's in its past. Maybe that's why I came here with lower expectations, that and the dearth of Vietnamese choices in the 'hood.It was empty late on a Friday afternoon as you would expect nowadays, so I decided to make a takeout order. I noticed the one covered patio table was vacant and changed my order to eat there. I started with the $8 Fresh Spring Rolls, my usual starter, and I was already impressed by the size and freshness of the rolls as the rice paper was packed with shrimp, sliced pork, mint, and vermicelli noodle, and accompanied by the requisite peanut sauce which was appropriately creamy (photo: bit.ly/36T8dhY).For the main part of my meal, I ordered the $12 Bun Rieu, which provided a bowl of hearty broth filled with tomato, crab meat, and pork meatball, tofu, shrimp cake, cha lua (Vietnamese pork sausage), and shredded Napa cabbage (photo: bit.ly/2UPOkCU). Absolutely delicious and frankly better than similar ones I've had in Little Saigon. I had a nice, safe dining experience there and hopefully I won't have to wait too long for my next visit. In the meantime, delivery will do for me as I want this one to survive and thrive.FOOD - 5 stars...a great bun rieu and stellar spring rollsAMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...pleasing from what I see...I got to know that patioSERVICE - 5 stars...accommodated my switch in order with easeTOTAL - 5 stars...nice to have a high quality Vietnamese spot in the Castro (...no offense, Castro Tarts!)RELATED - Exploring the Castro? Here's a collection of places I've visited and reviewed: bit.ly/2HrpFPC,Fragrant kind of, but my broth was weak as hell. Maybe because it was Sunday and everyone is hungover and orders pho.  Possible they may have added water or started new broth?,5/5This is one of my go-to Doordash spots now so I had to come here and leave it a great review.Ambiance: - Haven't been inside before! Only ordered delivery.Reservations: - Haven't been inside before! Only ordered delivery.Staff: - Haven't been inside before! Only ordered delivery.Items Ordered:- Garlic Noodles (5/5): These are my favorite garlic noodles in the city. They just are very unique and super flavorful. I don't even need to add a protein to enjoy them but adding the chicken is delicious as well. - Spring Rolls (5/5): Also the best spring rolls I've had in the city. They have meat in them as well as some crunch from an almost fried rice paper and I LOVE it. Pricing: 5/5 I think they are priced very fairly in SF for what you get and the portions that you get.

Ordered a vermicelli dish and it was a few steps above the average Vietnamese place that I've been to. Not only was it delicious but the presentation showed that the chef put a lot of care into it.Wait staff was really welcoming and nice. Food came fast. Bench and chairs are a little uncomfortable but the pillows help. Been there twice, can't wait to go back.,A cute spot on Castro, good service and yummy food. I ordered the five spice chicken and added a fried egg. The chicken was tender and well roasted.,Had the Combo Pho.  Surprisingly really hit the spot.   Some of the other menu items seems a bit pricy, some seems very reasonable.  Pho was in the reasonable catagory.The broth was light, but had good flavor and my lips feel a bit sticky which I like.  All the meat was tasty, especially the tendon.,Second visit in, and even more impressed with this visit than my last visit (which was also a 5 star review).   I ordered the Hue style Pork/Beef pho.  It was delicious!   Slightly spicy, slightly tangy and just the right amount.   I have never had this style of soup before, but I will definitely order it again.  I also got spring rolls, which to my delight, there was a small crunchy something inside.  A very nice addition to the already tasty rolls, which I might add were very fresh and moist!   Service was incredibly fast and the server that helped me was really sweet!,We ate at Tanglad  on a cold and windy evening in SF.  We chose to eat indoors because of the cold weather.   Their tables are well placed and socially distanced from each other.  The staff  wear masks per usual.  There is a patio area in the front of the restaurant with windows that can open for yet another dining option.Service was excellent and the restaurant was very clean.  I love the smell of Vietnamese food wafting through the air.The menu is  large and there are many types of soup. We kept it basic for our first time here.We both ordered garlic noodles and I added the Five Spice Chicken sandwich and my partner added the grilled pork chop.The servings are large and the presentations are appealing.  The grilled chicken was fantastic--so flavorful and perfectly cooked.  I opted for the jalapenos on the side but added all other accoutrements to the sandwich.The grilled chop was flavored well and was close to being picked up and eaten without utensils!I noticed a lot of other diners enjoying Pho, Bun Rieu and other types of noodle soups.  That will be my next choice too.  Perfect for a chilly evening.Tanglad is a great option to have in the Castro.,Great Pho !!! We are visiting from Chicago and are avid Pho Eaters (1x a week or every two weeks)I was hesitant to try the combo because the tendon and meatballs are usually too chewy for me but I figured I'd give it a try since we are in San Fran. My combination which is so much more affordable than it would have been back home. Great portion size and it superseded my expectations. I thought I might end up putting the meatball and tendon to the side, but NOPE... I can't believe it was my favorite part! I couldn't get enough. The meatball actually tasted like a meatball and was full of flavor. The tendon was AMAZING... it melted in my mouth not chewy at all ! Definitely recommended giving the combo a try! My husband Mr. B got the spicy Pho 8.5-9.2/10 only because he wished he would've had meatballs... I did share some of mine with him. If you like spicy get this bowl with its creeping heat, he said the broth was exceptional. The staff was so friendly to everyone who came in, even Addressing pick up orders by name. They're like 9 months new. Stop in and show some love!!,Was craving a bowl of Pho on a cold Monday afternoon and found this spot. Stopped by for a quick lunch and saw they had bun bo hue so I ordered that. I'm pretty picky with my soup and noodles but man this bowl was spot on!! Perfect amount of spice and the broth was super flavorful! (Their bun bo hue comes with the pho noodles instead of the thicker ones, which I actually prefer the pho noodles) Service was friendly and great, perfect stop for a quick lunch.Will definitely need to come back to try the rest of th,Ordered delivery yesterday: five spice chicken pho and the crispy imperial rolls. The five spice chicken was a generous portion and very flavorful, and the broth was perfectly seasoned. The crispy imperial rolls were also exactly what I was expecting. Obviously, they were not as crispy as in person due to delivery but crispy enough! Will order from here again. Thank you!,Food is on point and great service too. I highly recommend checking this restaurant out!,Highly recommend this Vietnamese cafe!  It's so delicious there!  I ordered a seafood combo pho, there were a lot of delicious shrimps, and the soup is very rich!  I also ordered crispy rolls, I can't forget about them, I want to go there again, at least for them!  The cafe has a very pleasant atmosphere, I have already told all my friends about it, and decided to write a review so that more people know how great it is!  thank you very much to all Tanglad employees!,This is one of the best hole in the wall restaurants that is consistently excellent. Their veggie options are delicious (veggie noodle soup, garlic noodles," veggie spring rolls). I highly recommend these items!! If you're feeling naughty get the Thai tea or Vietnamese iced coffee The ambience inside is also very cute as they have a """"Garden"""" sun-room in the front part of the restaurant with a plant wall. Thank you for being amazing @ Tanglad!!!!",I'm such a food fanatic when it comes to Vietnamese salads. The grilled pork salad I ordered was very flavorful and the pork had a specific rubbed used. It was great. I deducted I star due to the spring rolls. I wasn't a huge fan of the imperial rolls inside of the fresh spring rolls (at least," that is what it looked like). There was some fried flakes in the rolls that took away from the light airy """"spring"""" flavor. Wasn't a fan of this dish. But the ingredients were tasty and clearly they made everything to order.",Food came out very quick, I ordered butter noddles with five spice chicken. It's decently priced and the taste is wonderful to my palate. If you are looking for a spot in Castro district and a filling dinner or lunch. Try this place. But if you value traditional Chinese/Thai cuisine, then this place is not gonna up to your standard.,Great food, user friendly menu if you are new to Vietnamese food. I had the lemongrass beef sandwich and it was so yummy! Friends had shrimp garlic noodles and 5 spice chicken soup...both delicious. Super fast and friendly service. Very convenient location if you are checking out the Castro.,Really love the combo plate here! Comes with pork, chicken, and I always upgrade the rice to Garlic Noodles. During COVID they have been accepting ToGo Orders, and have outside dining (when permitted). The staff has always been very friendly.Also a decent bowl of Pho in the Castro!,Foods are really great especially the Pho and Bunwich. Staff are so friendly and the place is so clean with Parking .AWESOME PLACE at the heart of San Francisco!,Fantastic.  Family affair with mom and the kids hard at work. Pho is incredibly delicious. I'll be back many times and plan to eat my way through the menu.,The food here was good and the service was fine.  You order at the counter and they bring food to you.  Since the restaurant is basically one big room, you do get a lot of the kitchen smell while you are dining.  The food itself is pretty standard Vietnamese food.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here when there are plenty of places that are similar.  I did see a lot of people having pho so maybe that was better.  The garlic noodles were a bit too oily for my taste.  Overall it was a good experience.,Best pho on Castro street. Garlic noodles are exceptional too!,good vietnamese place with a different take on the dishes..I got chicken egg and rice. Different preparation and comfort food. It's in the Castro and worth visiting again.,We stopped by for lunch and it was delicious! I guess they recently open and the beer license will be in next week. Imperial rolls were very good.Garlic noodles with chicken was excellent. The chicken was the standout.. large portions of perfectly tender chicken. It was the best chicken I've had in awhile. Great service. We'll be back,Probably the best pho we have tried in the city so far. Wish the imperial rolls were a little bigger with more garnishes but the pho was fantastic! (Ordered the rare steak). Nice little spot in the Castro.,A new and wonderful addition to the neighborhood. From the moment they opened, even during the pandemic, they have been cranking out some great food. The spring rolls are big and louche, so flavorful. Garlic noodles are all that and more. Squid fan? They've got yours, and the sauce is tangy sweet. Not a bum dish on the menu. Even the wings soar!Enjoy!,There's finally a viet place in the Castro. The bun bo hue is great for a cold day/night. Warning to those that can't stand spicy food though. It may not be your style if you don't like hot/spicy soups.,Stumbled here on a cold and raining day to get ourselves some hot noodles. The 5 spice chicken with garlic noodles was a bit sweet. The pork chop with rice was good, pork chop was nicely grilled. Service was good.Would recommend this place.,DOORDASH ORDER!!! If you're craving Vietnamese food and hesitant because this is a new spot you never heard of, just order!!!! They just opened last year on Castro Street. Banh Mi - Made with traditional French baguette bread (soft, light and crispy) unlike other banh mi shops that use Italian bread or the harder chewier breads that cater to SF tastes. This place makes an authentic Dac Biet sandwich with head cheese FYI," ham and cha lua. This place does NOT use roast pork instead of head cheese. I didn't know Bc the DoorDash menu said """"jambon"," ham and fancy pork"""". Pho - the to go container is light on the broth (medium soup container instead of large)", but that's okay. It's flavorful. Ask for extra broth if you like your bowl FILLED with soup. Goi Cuon - Large and shareable. They use cha lua instead of sliced boiled pork which was interesting. Not a fan but it still tasted good. Fresh coconut - this was really good! You get a whole real coconut for $4! You won't find that price anywhere in Castro!!! SUPPORT YOUR ASIAN BUSINESSES NOW!!!!!!!,This restaurant took over the space for Slurp Noodle Bar. Ordered take out for lunch. Got the garlic noodles with chicken and the grilled pork with vermicelli and fried spring rolls. I had asked for less noodles and extra veggies which they were more than generous in accommodating. Both portions were enough to make 2 meals each. The chicken was very tender, almost like it was pressure cooked, but was bland. I could taste a hint of 5 spice, though it could be due to finding pieces of star anise in the dish. This is best eaten the same day. The chicken hardened as left overs. I was surprised there was plenty of veggies inside, which is good. The grilled pork was flavorful and I would order that again.,Went a week or so ago with a friend for lunch. I had beef pho, and my friend had the same. We also spilt some fresh spring rolls. It was absolutely delicious. Some of the best pho ive ever had, and the spring rolls were delicious as well. The staff was super kind, the food was fast to come out, and the seating outside is beautiful. I'll definitely be back,On a Saturday morning, I requested delivery. The garlic noodle was the saddest, most inedible, and disgusting excuse for garlic I'd ever seen from a Vietnamese restaurant. I just hope it was a mistake and not how they cooked their garlic noodle. Very greasy, and I'm not sure what the flavor is--I didn't finish it all, not even half of it.Fortunately, the calamari and rolls were delicious, though the imperial rolls were not crispy, possibly due to the late delivery. We'll give them another shot the next time, hoping not to be disappointed.,I've been here multiple times now and the food is incredible. Don't miss out on the beef garlic noodles. The price is so reasonable for the area as well. Will continue to come back for the quick service and delicious Vietnamese menu.,"Loved this new spot for some delicious Vietnamese food. Ordered the """"Vegetarian Noodle Soup"""" which is vegetarian pho. The veggie broth was delicious", didn't even need to add any sauces to it! They put a generous amount of vegetables in the soup, loved it! Also, they make their spring rolls when your order, so I was able to get Shrimp Spring rolls without pork. They were fresh and crispy! Not sure what was in the middle of the roll but it added a perfect crunch. The spring rolls were also served with some pickled veggies. This business is family owned and operated. The service was quick, friendly, and everyone was wearing a mask. All their tables are setup outside because of COVID. Did not see any heaters, so if you get cold easily be sure to bundle up. All in all, will definitely be coming back to support this business! Fairly priced, good portion sizes, and delicious food!!,My first time here. Very clean restaurant and nice, polite staff. I ordered calamari. Very nicely served but the sauce ( which I did not ask to pour the sauce on the top of the calamaris) was too sweet. I could barely taste the calamari, It was like I am having melted oily sugar.,Friendly folks serving great food. Most places in the Castro cater to the tourists. As a resident of this neighborhood, the vibe of Tanglad is simple and humble compared to its neighborhood and that is great for me.Quality is about 9 out of 10 in my book. Best pho within walking distance of me for sure. Again the staff makes this place amazing to me. I eat here two to three times a week on purpose.,First time dining here," and it didn't disappoint. Reasonably priced and delicious food""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Otra,"Stopped by just for a drink & the cucumber cocktail was spot on as well as my michelada, we had already ate or else we would've ordered some food. The menu looked really good & the food smelled delicious. Will definitely be back to try the food!,We used waitlist to queue for the restaurant so we were able to get in as soon as we arrived. The place is quite nicely decorated, although the music and the whole place was too loud for me so I can't really enjoy being there.The vegan options are plenty which I really appreciate! They taste alright and the waiting staff are less helpful in making recommendations than we'd wish they are.,I saw this place while driving along Lower Haight. I decided to stop by because my curiosity is somehow telling me to try this place. So I decided to stop after work. Once I stepped into the restaurant, I didn't realize this restaurant is not your typical Mexican restaurant. It's pretty classy. I was wearing a scrubs upon going inside the restaurant. But who gives a f? I'm hungry and I wanted something to eat.I order the Beef Tacos and the Vegatables y Gigante Bean Ribolitta. I also ordered the cake for dessert and the Old Oaxacan. I don't mind the food for being pricey but servings are pretty small. The staff is wonderful and accomodating.,Very tasty, but also very salty, especially the mussels that we got. With the chorizo, it would've been nice to have it a bit less salty. Enjoyed the two salsas that came with the totopos and salsa appetizer--both were complex and mouth warming. The mushroom tacos were full of umami and well-balanced, though on the mushy side if you care about textures. Everything tasted fresh and made with quality ingredients. The drinks were solid and positively cheap at $12 a pop. Service was great, and the vibe inside was great for a casual-ish date. Did this place stand out among the many great Mexican/taco places in the city? Not really. But I didn't try their meat tacos, so maybe that would've made the difference!,Not sure how we ended up at Otra (a suggestion from my son, I think) but we enjoyed dinner with our nephew as well who was working on a pop up for Samsung near Union Square.We shared an order of Brussels Sprouts, and they were terrific. It was a Taco night for us and we ordered Hen of the Woods Mushroom and Beef Tacos. They were excellent.Three glasses of Azul Resposado started out the dinner (my wife had the Santo Tomas Merlot, but tasted the tequila). The young men each had a Mezcal Margarita chaser.My one complaint - they actually charged me $1 for extra chips! Bush league, my friends - especially after the Azul Resposado. Lost a star on that move!,This place has unfortunately gone downhill since I first visited back in 2021. While the cocktails here are still consistently good, the food can be a hit or miss (lately the latter). I recently had a weekday dinner here (with no wait) and tried the following:- Frijolitos con chips (0/5): What a disappointment! The bean dip was so watered down that I would consider this bean water or bean juice (with no pulp) instead of a dip. There's also supposed to be queso in this, but I didn't see any. This was the biggest disappointment of the night because the bean dip here was so much better when I first had it over a year ago.- Cod tostada (2/5): This was somewhat bland, and the tostada can easily be mistaken for something found at a fast food chain. The redeeming factor was the cod, but there were so few tiny pieces of cod. - Grilled pork ala pastor (3/5): The pork was flavorful and juicy, and I liked the texture of the tortilla. But the ""refried beans"" were more watery/liquid than refried, and the ""green rice"" tasted like plain rice. - Jalisco 75 cocktail (4.5/5): I really enjoyed this tequila cocktail! It was refreshing, and the elderflower really shined through nicely. Overall, this was a disappointing experience. I'd stop by Otra for a cocktail before dinner, but I'm not sure if I'd want to risk another bad dinner here unless the food quality picks back up again.,3.5 starsWe got the Conchas Borrachas (mussels), and brussels sprouts. The mussels were tasty but the dish came with three small tortillas, we wanted a few more. The Brussels were overly seasoned, and tasted like they were marinated in pure hot sauce with not much other flavor. Service was great and the outside area allows dogs.,Really cute decor and a very popular restaurant. We waited a while for a table on Friday night. We ordered the chips and salsa, mushroom tacos, beef tacos, cod tostados, and the kampachi. They have good veggie options as my vegan friend also ordered sweet potato tacos and the carrot tostados. Our server was super friendly and great, but unfortunately the food was overall just okay for me. Maybe slightly better than avg tacos but I might have had higher expectations given the reviews. The cod was a bit dry and my favorite dish were the beef tacos. It's still worth giving this place a try though!,Food: We did family style and shared all the plates. We got the totopos and salsas first. Both of them were absolutely amazing. I'd love to take them home and add them to all my meals(note: red one is mild spicy) The totopos were perfectly crunchy, and a little on the salty side. The brussels sprouts. I don't know where to start. Probably the best ones I have had. The amount of flavor is perfect, the texture and crispiness is perfect, I loved everything about them. The sweet potato tacos were super good, very loaded, but I recommend adding some of the red and/or green salsa to them! Beef tacos were also great!Dessert: tres leches. Perfect texture, one of the best tres leches I have had. Drinks: Poco Poco (mezcal + watermelon) had a tajin rim, great drink. My friend had the Penicillin 42 (mezcal + ginger) and was super happy with it as well. Service: I added ourselves to the waitlist saying I'd be there in 20-30 minutes. When we arrived they checked us in, we waited for 3 minutes for the table.,We came in for a late dinner and focused on their veggie offerings. The highlight was the charred cabbage salad which was smoky and tasty. We tried some tacos as well. The mushroom tacos were over seasoned and salty although my dining partner liked them.  The salad could"" have been more thoroughly dressed as there were lots of bites that just tasted like plain kale. A nice venue, good veggie selection. I'd come back and give it another,Fun weekday spot for good Tapas.Arrived at 6:30 on Wednesday night and got seated right away in the back. Note there is no cell service in the back of the restaurant (not a big deal but something to note).We started out with the Aguachile which was phenomenal but really spicy. If you get this, it is really great but expect some spice because it's got some heat!We then also had the chips and salsa (first thing on the top of the menu), which was great as well. The chips are thick and the salsa is smoky and delicious - exactly how I like it.We got the cabbage salad which was crispy and flavorful. This isn't something I've ever had before, but it was really unique. Would get again.For our mains we split the beef tacos, fish tacos and the pork tenderloin main entree. The beef tacos and pork tenderloin were. phenomenal. Very flavorful and nicely balanced.The only part of the mean that I really did not enjoy were the fish tacos. They were really fishy and not super appetizing. I couldn't eat my portion and no one else from our party ate their full portion either. This felt like a miss when everything else was so good.Overall I would definitely come back.,Went here with a friend who's a vegetarian (and chose this place for being veggie friendly). I'm happy she chose this place! The service is friendly and pretty quick. They have a cute parklet and a few sidewalk tables, which is really nice for warm days/nights! They also have heat lamps. I got the fish tostada and it was just ok...the mushroom and sweet potato tacos were actually the standouts for me! So much flavor for things that don't have meat! ;)As a meat lover, I would recommend this place for anyone to try. But try the veggie options because I think they're better!,My first time at Otra, overall great experience as in the restaurant is clean, nicely decorated, and super friendly staff. We arrived around 6:30pm on a Friday and it wasn't too crowded and we're seated immediately. It did seem to get busier as it got later. Everyone at my table enjoyed what they ordered. I'm not giving such a great rating because of my personal opinions on what I ordered. I had the cod tostadas which I don't think I would order again. Yes the cod was fresh and cooked that it's still soft, however it really lacked flavor. The brussels on the other hand were packed with flavor but in a confusing way. It was really salty, possibly too much fish sauce and the lime really hits you. The chips itself were fine, they'll come ask you if you want extra chips- it's a dollar extra. The dips were good but honestly I wouldn't be pressed to order the chips again. Ending my review on a high note though, the spicy house margarita was delicious! I'm a sucker for a good spicy margarita and this one was definitely a good and refreshing one.,TL;DR - Quality, delicious food with outdoor seating.Everything was extremely tasty and felt upscale without being out of reach. Appetizers //Totpos and Salsas: The chips are super fresh and you can get more chips for just $1. The two salsas were well-seasoned and different enough from each other to give you interest.Aguachile: This is very similar to a ceviche, but the kampachi is in larger pieces and it was very fresh.Albonigas en Mole Verde: This is a delicious meat ball, you got about 5 pieces which are all pretty large. I would say get this if you are looking to share with a group. You could even slice the pieces in half and have 10 smaller pieces. Mains //Grilled Pork ala Pastor: Larger pieces than I'm used to, and with a lot more fat than I'm used to. The refried beans were too salty for me.Vegetable y Gigante Bean Ribolitta: This was delicious and very different than most things I've ever eaten! I recommend this for vegetarians.Overall, good experience, the food was delicious.,Wonderful food and service. We sat outside and enjoyed various appetizers, wonderful maqueritas and entrees to follow. The fish was especially delicious and we even managed to share a few desserts. The chef has a nice twist of traditional dishes. Happy this place is close to my house :),Some dishes were fantastic and some misses. The tacos were all good- generous and flavorful  the mussels were also very good - especially the sauce..We did not like the charred cabbage. Vinegar overwhelmed the dish.,Was a little disappointed. We read some great reviews so decided to try it out. Service was great. I sat outside with my dog & got tacos to take home for my boyfriend.Here is what was ordered:1. Frijolitos con chips: the beans were puréed with a spicy peanut oily sauce on top. It lacked texture, the oil/crushed peanut/chili salsa on top only served to add too much spice. Maybe we should have ordered a side of guacamole & salsa to go with it.But the texture was a turn off, would have preferred it had some whole beans. It was almost like a milk shake you could drink.2. Beef Tacos: Again, wasn't what we expected. The beef was served in ~1""x1"" cubes. It was not tender. Meat required a lot of chew & was so sour. We used the avocado condiment  to eat about 3 bites per taco. It just wasn't what we expected at all. Not thin & tender, medium-rare like asada (skirt/flank/hanger/pounded sirloin) but also not tender and fall apart like a long stewed piece of beef chuck/short rib.3. Grilled Pork Al Pastor: the flavor was okay. I think they use pork tenderloin instead of pork butt/shoulder. The meat ended up being a little tough. We're used to a different cut of pork being marinated and then cooked. The meat gets sliced thinly as does the onion pieces & pineapple. It all gets out in a corn tortilla & is topped with chopped onion, cilantro & avocado-salsa verde. The pineapple chunks were too big & it didn't come with a any guacamole or salsa.Maybe we just ordered the wrong items? Again would like to say the service was perfect! Employees were attentive & friendly. We're going to try it again & order other items.,They have a nice dog-friendly streetery and we're able to accommodate us as a walk up. Everything we ate was excellent and reasonably priced. I'll definitely be going back!,The clam stew is amazing! Solid place for vegan tacos too! They are well seasoned and delicious.,Food was very tasty - modern take on traditional Mexican food. Food: Pozole sent me back to my abuela's kitchen. Savory soup is balanced with freshness and crunch of the cabbage and onion. Aguachile was sooo fresh - excellent balance of citrus, spice, and salt with buttery-soft fish. The food is upscale so it's on the pricey side with small portions but you're paying for high quality ingredients. For example Tortillas are all made with heirloom corn which makes a big difference in quality. Cocktails: are excellent and strong  you can order them while you wait for your table!,Unique Mexican food. Service was great and enough options for vegetarians. It was a rare hot day and nice to sit outside in their sidewalk/park let. We did like their vegetarian options. And we'd come back again. That day the lines were super strong so in our drinks and also some of the food- was a bit ""limey"". We will come back again.,One of the better Mexican restaurants in the area. Nice atmosphere, much larger than it looks from outside. We had great service, the drinks were perfect and the food was excellent. The aguachile and grilled asparagus tostada were both delicious.,This is my third or fourth time dining at Otra but first time trying their brunch menu items (which I believe were recently introduced last month). Overall delicious as always. The chilaquiles had a bit of a spice and for me I would have preferred an over easy egg on top + more poblano crema and cheese. But still a good option and quite filling!,Enjoyed an incredible meal in this beautiful restaurant, highly recommend giving this spot a try. Menu is Mexican inspired with lots of vegetarian options. Went on a Thursday at 6pm and didn't have to wait. They offer both outdoor parklet seating and indoor.Beverage: Spanish 75- their twist on the french 75 with tequila, elderflower liquor, prosecco and lime. Really refreshing, well balance and tasty cocktail. Great way to start the meal. Food: Frijolitas con chips - fantastic well seasoned  warm, cream, smooth black bean dip served with tortillas chips. Definitely order one for the table.Aguachile - fresh hamachi slices with pieces of apple, red onion and serrano. This was spicy but addictive with lots of black pepper. Served with tortilla chips.Ensalada - kale, peas, pickled onion, feta lots of textures, flavors and colors in this hearty salad. Was good but might try something else on the menu next time. Hen of the wood mushroom tacos - order comes with two, these were delicious meaty mushroom with creamy avocado, a slight kick from the crema and a touch of saltiness from the queso all on a soft tender housemade tortilla. Roasted Carrots Toastda - order also comes with two,  tostadas, really lovely sweet roasted carrot, spicy salsa, creamy hummus and crunchy tostada fantastic combination of flavors and textures. Grilled Al Pastor - friend ordered and didn't taste but they said it was really good, came with Al pastor, rice, beans and a few tortillasOverall service was warm and friendly, it did take a bit to get our second round of drinks but other than that great experience. Would definitely come back to try other items on the menu. Size of dishes is on the small side but I think it's worth it for the quality.,What a nice addition to the Haight from the owners of Son's Addition!  It's solid Mexican food here that's a bit elevated.  The Cod Tacos were much better than I expected.  It's more like two tostadas with cod that wasn't deep fried, as it often is with tacos.  Instead, the cod was grilled, fresh and moist.  The house made tortilla held up really well too.  Sometimes the tortillas break or get soggy, but these were just right.The Charred Cabbage is a fun and different way to squeeze in your veggies.  It definitely had a prominent charred flavor to it, which I liked, but it did require a lot of chewing.  I don't think it was parboiled or precooked, so you'll want to cut it up in smaller pieces, rather than take in a big mouthful, which I made the mistake of doing.  The nice and creamy Flan was a real highlight!  It's smaller in size, but really good.  Really really good.,Wow! I was truly blown away by the ambience and the creativity of the menu. We started out with drinks, Spanish 75 packed a punch. This drink was so beautiful it didn't even taste like tequila. Nice and refreshing on the pallet the price point was good too. Onto the food. We tried the hen of the words, the beef, and the sweet potato taco.I don't even know where to start, the head of the woods you couldn't even tell it wasn't meat. The mushrooms were tender and beautifully seasoned very tasty combination. The sweet potato taco was mine blowing, the potato felt like meat in your mouth very tasty. The beef was amazing nice chunks of meat well seasoned super tender very flavorful.The only criticism I have is that the tacos are very tiny so maybe they can give you three instead of two so it'll be filling. The price isn't too bad about average 5 to 6 dollars per taco. And I would've liked my sweet potato a little more crispy but overall amazing!,Overall, I think this place is very good, though some of the dishes didn't totally work for me. The stars of the meal were the chips and bean dip, meatball appetizer, and the mushroom and beef tacos. The bean dip has incredible flavor, the meatball appetizer is bright and herbaceous. Both tacos had incredible texture, with the mushroom ones having a nice snap and the beef ones being almost melt in your mouth but not so much that it doesn't have a little chew. All super great. The mussels aren't bad either but still seemed to be missing a little something. The two dishes I was less into were the spicy Brussels sprouts and the charred cabbage. Both just felt too sour to me in such a way that it totally overpowered the dish. Which is a shame because they would have been such perfect accompaniments to he somewhat heavier fare.,We stopped by on a Tuesday night and got seated right away. They seemed to be understaffed so there was a bit of a wait for our food, but what place isn't currently dealing with this same issue?! Despite that the staff was very friendly and attentive! Their house margarita with mezcal and habanero was perfectly smoky, spicy, and citrusy - by far one of the best I've had in the city. The conchas borrachas were very flavorful, the cod tostadas were amazing, but the beef tacos were unreal - you can tell the meat was marinated for a very long time because when you bit into the taco you were greeted with a very tender and juicy bite. Will definitely be back to try more items!,Highly recommended. I really enjoyed the food and the space. Also, a $20 corkage fee never hurts :). The service was a little slow/inattentive, but that wasn't an issue for us.The mushroom tacos were amazing and we also really enjoyed the black bean dip. I will definitely be back.Another thing to note is that they don't take reservations, but we put our names on the Yelp waitlist ahead of time, but that wasn't necessary.,I was so excited to try this. I have been seeing this pop up for a while on my social media. So I suggested this to my friends for our outing. Sadly, it wasn't as amazing as I thought it would be. The chips were stale I think. The bean dip was amazing. The food was good but not amazing. I would be down to go again but not my top spots.,Everything about this place is a hit. The cocktails are spectacular and creative, great tequila and mezcal selection, amazing house made hot sauce, great friendly staff who seem to love what they do and offer suggestions and talk in depth about the food and drinks, and the decor is super beautiful. Okay, the food, holy smokes. EVERYTHING is delicious. The brunch, the dinner... omg. This is my new fave spot in the lower haight.,Another reviewer nailed it - authentic but not traditional. Think colorful, produce-driven tacos and sides. Mostly vegetables, where meat is used as a garnish or for flavor rather than being the main protagonist (hello grilled cabbage with smoked bone marrow). This is me to a T - I love it when meat takes backseat and veg get showered in glory. The Hen of the Woods taco was a winner.I also really dig what Otra is doing with masa. It's ground on site, it's all kind of colors and it's pressed super thin for tacos but cut thick for crunchy tortilla chips.The icing on the cake - or should I say: salt rim on the margarita - is the well-stocked mezcal and tequila bar. I could have easily ordered every cocktail on the list.While service was a bit forgetful, all in all Otra is a wonderful addition to this forgotten part of Haight St.,Fantastic spot, the cabbage was phenomenal, which is was certainly not expected and the mushroom tacos were wonderful. They were very accommodating to our large group.,Best spicy margaritas anywhere!!! And a very delicious beef taco to go with them, because you can't have just one,Fun place to go with friends. Delicious tacos and salads.  The drinks are strong and delicious.  Outdoor seating with heaters. Hens do the woods tacos are to die for.We will be back.,What a great new addition to the hood!   A buddy of mine and I came in for a quick appetizer and drink and the bartender Chad had some great recommendations.  The aguachile was absolutely amazing, as were the drinks he made us and the service. Overall impression is I need more of this in my life!!,The beef tacos and the cod tostadas are incredible. Best Mexican food in SF. Highly recommend.,Really good spot in Haight. It didn't take too long to get seated and the ambience inside the restaurant was beautiful! They had a nice blue seating. My friend and I shared the black bean dip, and then I got the grilled kampachi instead of the tacos and honestly it was so delicious. The perfect amount of spice and the refried beans went really well with the fish and tortilla they gave. Would 100% come back,Never disappointed when I come here I'm adding it to my favorites Cocktails are great. Staff are really pleasant.,Awesome food. Skip the chips and salsa. Mussels, beef tacos and charred cabbage are all so good.,Came here with a small group for dinner, and it was a great spot. The back of the restaurant was slightly crowded so we couldn't hear each other well.We got to try a variety of different thingsChips/ salsa - 4/5, would recommend the frijolitos instead Ensalada - 5/5, solid veggie option Sweet potato tacos - 4/5; pretty solid but wouldn't get againBeef tacos - 4/5, beef was super tender and well cooked Hamachi collar - 4/5, fish was a little dry but large in portionAguachile- 5/5, thought the flavor and texture of the fish were greatCoconut flan- 5/5, absolutely recommend! Toasty flavor and soft texture,I had my birthday dinner here and really liked what Okra had to offer to my friends and I.  We got the mushroom tacos and cod tostada (not in the picture because it disappeared really fast).  The food portions are reallly small, like sample sizes, but it's surprising tasty and overall well curated.  We really enjoyed the flavor profile.  Would definitely recommend, but have a snack before you come or something lol.,upscale, vegetarian-friendly mexican food. nice outdoor seating. totopos and salsa - this had two dips, both of which were delicious. i especially liked the creamy one.sweet potato tacos - i always think the potatoes could be browned more, but this is overall a nice dish, not too spicyhen of the woods tacos - my favorite thing on the menu! super rich with a LOT of cremacarrot tostada - this is a really bright dish with a lot of crunchasparagus tostada - just ok; not super memorable,My boyfriend had heard this place was opening well before we even moved to the area, so we had to check it out within the first weeks after it officially opened. I heard about craft mezcal-based cocktails and plant-forward nueva Mexican cuisine, and I am totally in! This upscale cuisine and vibe was just what this area needed. During (hopefully what is) the tail-end of the Covid-era, they had socially distanced inside tables and a nice parklet out front. We came on a nice day and walked over early enough to snag a table outside. Though the menus were limited, we had no problem finding enticing options. I'm gluten free and was happy to hear than most items on the menu could accommodate. We decided to choose an item or two to share from each section: we got the aguachile, braised cabbage, beef and carrot tacos, and hamachi. Everything we got was pretty good and fresh - not at all heavy. The seasonings and sauces were flavorful and a good level of spiciness, but also made it a bit messy to eat! I was a bit disappointed we got hamachi fillets and we had to ask for tortillas even though the menu said it was collar and came with tortillas (and that was the main reason I wanted to go there). As for the drinks, we got a couple each so I got to taste the margarita, smoky Paloma, mezcaleroni, and old Oaxacan. All good, but I had been making a lot of my own mezcal cocktails at home during quarantine and all sounded/tasted like something I could easily make at home - I would like to suggest to have some more interesting ingredients and mixology on the drink menu so I'm more willing to pay those prices! Or they could add a happy hour!Service was a little slow, but they got busy while we were there and they are still a young restaurant so I'd expect that to get better later on. Overall, a good dinner experience with  good, healthy-ish food.,Cute place in a nice area on Haight. Parking is tough there, which isn't surprising. Great cocktails and cocktail menu. But the food was way, way, way, way, ..., way too salty. Especially the chips, which came with almost every dish, but really everything was salty. I was wondering if the people who seasoned the food recently recovered from COVID and their smell/taste isn't all the way back yet, so they compensated. I would go back if in the neighborhood for a cocktail, but not the food.,Opening Day for their brunch menu! Delicioso!! Tried two items both flavor bombs. El Sencillo - two perfectly fried eggs with crazy good peanut salsa macha. The chorizo sausage was perfectly browned/crispy edges - reminiscent of middle eastern chapli kebab. Fabulous. Also - Suadero Hash - juicy tender beef steak cubes with potatoes and asparagus, in an amazing rich spicy sauce, two perfectly poached eggs. Coffee is from a local merchant who donates proceeds to the coffee cooperative in Oaxaca (from where the beans are sourced). Will come back and try dinner soon. Muy excellente!!!,Checked out this place tonight and was pleasantly surprised. We were worried about a long wait but were seated within 15 minutes for a party of 5 at around 7 pm on a Sunday, which is pretty good in my opinion. The food came out very fast, and the waiters were all very nice. The star of the show was the food though! I tried the mushroom tacos and the beef tacos, both of which blew me away, especially the mushroom tacos. I would say those are the must try. I didn't know mushrooms could taste so good. The other perfect touch to the tacos were the handmade tortillas- they had excellent flavor and just the right amount of structural integrity to hold the filling. All around a great meal,Going downhill.  I came to this restaurant after it first opened and it was amazing.  Now?  Not so much.  So salty.  Mostly everything that was supposed to be served warm was room temperature.  I ordered the meatballs, tiny, way too spicy and lukewarm.  The pork was dry, fatty and again, lukewarm. The drinks were meh and everything was overpriced for what it is.  The service is quick but we felt rushed even tho the place wasn't busy.  The bartender/server seemed over it.  Save your money and just go to a mission burrito place.  It's sad good restaurants in San Francisco start off strong then slowly become mediocre and not worth the $27 dried out pork.,Otra had some delicious food. The mussels were tasty but we had a lot of closed shells so we ended up not eating a bunch of the mussels. The tacos were my favorite. The Hamachi was not bad, a tad under seasoned. The cocktails were great and service was excellent. This could by my new neighborhood spot!,Yum! A great addition to the food scene!Contemporary, high-end Mexican food.Charming interior and exterior seating. Good service. Easy menu, ordering, paying by phone. Had paper menus as well.Solid food and drink options.Party of two for dinner. Easy to get seated and responsive service.Had the following:- Conchas Borrachas - steamed mussels and chorizo. Well prepared, great flavors, big portion size.- Charred cabbage - holy yum! Kept seeing others get this, impulse got it. Super delivered. Very well prepared, good herbs and seasonings, bone marrow bonus. Hearty and tasty.- Slow cooked beef tacos - excellent! Really high quality, amazing flavors. Went for a round two on these.- Sweet potato tacos - also excellent!- Hen of the woods tacos - kind of surprisingly good. Well roasted mushrooms, just the right variety to not be mushroom chewy or anything off in a taco. Good taste and texture.- Pitcher of house margaritas - trouble! Tasty and strong, went down very easily!- Tres leches cake - on the right side of the line of moisture to not fall into the trap of the standard too soggy tres leches. Absolutely incredible flavor.Plenty more to try and very much looking forward to doing so!,Organized a group birthday dinner of 12 here, and the restaurant was so accommodating! I worked with Anna via email, and she was quick to respond. We had the option to create a preset menu, but decided to go with the full menu. The food was delicious & our table ordered pitchers of the Poco Poco + Spicy Paloma - both great drinks! We ordered the mussels, charred cabbage, and spicy Brussels sprouts to share. Would highly recommend the Brussels sprouts. We were even able to bring balloons and table decorations, and they even kept our birthday cake in the fridge during dinner. Cole, our server, was also super attentive. Overall, a great atmosphere with fantastic service! Will definitely be coming back here again.,This joint is so rocking with the food!! I had the frijolitos  con chips and it was delicious,the black bean purée was just outstanding! Totopos and salsas was spectacular came with homemade chips con charred salsa y tomatillo arbol was equally outstanding ! Suadero Hash 18 was remarkable if I had the room in my belly I  would have had  two!!! We will definitely be back next Sunday for yet another wonderful brunch thank you Nick and Anna for having such a great staff Vanessa was so on it was spooky loved her!!,We had a lovely experience here. They're super new and treated us very kindly. The water refill man was ON POINT - and SO bubbly and sweet. The chef/owner came over to us and talked about the murals (his sister in law painted them) and the origin of the pictures on the wall (all his family!).We ordered:- Smoky palmo pitcher- Spicy mrgarita pitcher- Aguachile (they gave us an extra for free!)- Frijolitos w/ chips- Charred cabbage- Slow cooked beef tacos- Roasted sweet potato tacos- Cod tostadasThey also gave us 2 tres leches cake slices + 1 flan order FOR FREE! I think it's because we lingered for so long. Our faves were definitely the charred cabbage, cod tostadas, and tres leches cake. My personal fave was the roasted sweet potato taco which reminded me of Cala's famous roasted sweet potato entree. Super delicious. The cocktails were great too, though I think next time I go I'll get an individual drink because the ice cubes in the pitchers made the drinks get a bit watery. There were a few kinks in the food (ie beef tacos and sweet potato tacos were a little lukewarm and not steaming hot). I think these kinks will be sorted out within the next few weeks as they figure out a better workflow. I think it's growing pains for now.All in all, great spot and highly reco going.,A must visit restaurant in San Francisco, California! The restaurant has indoor and outdoor place to dine in. They have a good ambience",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The interior design is a amazing. Its perfect place for your next instagram post! We started with frijolito dip. The presentation of the food is nice. It tastes good as well. For the main dish, I recommend the beef tacos! Its so mouth watering, flavorful, and has a perfect taste of authetic tacos. They also offer great drinks! Its a place for everybody. The service we received is above and beyond. We really had a wonderful time and will definetly come back! The restaurant is open Monday-Friday (4:30-10pm) Sundays (4:30-9:30pm) They are located in 682 Height St. San Francisco CA. They take reservations for parties 6 or more. You can also order pick up!,Friday funday! After picking up out kiddo from daycare, we headed over to Otra to see if we could snag a table before the masses arrived. To our surprise, we were seated within a couple of minutes. Just to be clear, though, we showed up ten minutes after they opened...early bird special, perhaps? Cole, our server, was simply the best. He made many excellent recommendations, provided us with top notch service, and was totally accommodating towards our child. Who would have known that they had a secret kids menu!? I guess it helps that he also has a little one, and he can emphasize with our desire to have fun in a much more adult and constrained way. Haha, Cole -- you rock! We loved your spicy mezcal margarita recommendation :)Such an amazing way to end a long week, and happy that we're only a couple blocks away from this amazing family-friendly establishment.,Came to the restaurant right at opening and we were sat right away. The staff is super friendly and I liked how they were able to recommend some things and describe what they would taste like as well. My items were the Frijolitas Con Chips, Totopos, and the Diablo margarita! Decent portion sizes and everything was flavorful.,Great tapas restaurant in Lower Haight. Went with a friend and tried out the beef tacos, the al pastor pork, and totopos and salsas. All the dishes were pretty good, but the beef tacos really knocked my socks off. The sauce was excellent, the beef was tender, and just overall a lovely flavor combination. The tacos were so tasty, we ended up ordering seconds! The Al Pastor was good, but was a little chewier than expected especially coming off the tacos. The chips and salsa were a great addition to the meal. I thought their salsas were diverse and flavorful and we ended up dipping the pork in the salsa. Their margaritas were quite refreshing and I really enjoyed them as well -- not too sour, but also not too sweet. I have a strong appreciation that you can get a pitcher to share too. Overall, one of the better Latin places around and would definitely recommend if you are in the area or live close by.,Otra was the meal that finally ended my long spell of mediocre restaurant meals. This was what I had been missing - creative, delicious food (and as an added plus,  reasonable prices!). Everything we ordered was a winner:Charred cabbage (lime-chile de arbol, smoked bone marrow, pecan dukkah) - The flavor profiles in this dish are super unique and go very well together. I love when people pay attention to the vegetables on their menu and it's not just an afterthought salad slapped on to the menu. Hen of the Woods Taco - These were delicious - overflowing with juicy mushrooms and paired with peanut salsa macha and poblano créma to add just the right creaminess and kick to bring it all together. Grilled Kampachi - I wasn't expecting much since all the press was focused on the fresh masa for the tortillas and tostadas, but man was I wrong. Don't miss out on this dish - the fish is super super tender (and the tomatillo salsa is a great pairing but honestly I could just eat that grilled fish on its own and be happy). Didn't have a chance to check out their desserts (the flan!) but will have to come back for it next time!,ive been coming to this spot since its debut on the block; the service and drinks are a-1! love the aguachile, conchas borrachas, and their smoky paloma. staples everytime i come back. and the toasted coconut flan is,Perfect place for vegetarians with non-vegetarian friends. A lot of veggie options and some great meat a and seafood options. All dishes were packed with flavor. The tortillas used are so authentic and expertly made.  Definitely get the Frijolitos! The drinks are also highly recommended,  loved the Old Oaxacan which is   a great mezcal old fashion.,Have gone twice for brunch and it's GREAT. Have had all the appetizers and they are sooooo good. They make their own chips and are a must have. Have had the Suedero Hash, the Pozole and the Chilaquiles de Chorizo Con Huevos. Will have ALL of them again and again. Vanessa , Chad and Joe are all very nice and helpful. Great service from all of them. AND THE PLACE IS SOOOOOO CLEAN!!! RUSH to this great restaurant!!,My new favorite neighborhood spot! The hen of the wood tacos and the pozole are amazing. The interior is gorgeous and I love the parklet. The highlight was Brian behind the bar, his service was excellent. He made our time at Otra extra special. Can't wait to come back!,- beef tacos were spot on!- chips and beans were great, however, the chips were a bit over salted. - mushroom tacos looked fantastic and the flavors were good. However, the mushrooms were over cooked and rubbery. Hard to bite into than usual. - a friend ordered the carrot tostada. The carrots were good but the tostada was over salted.- I wasn't a bit fan of the drinks. But maybe that's a personal preference. I hope this feedback is helpful to the restaurant chef and owners. I'll be returning for the beef tacos :),Great specialty drinks, indoor and outdoor seating. Food came out promptly and the bar tender was knowledgeable about the entire menu. Food was perfect and shareable. Great for a date night.,Great place and was constantly busy even on a Monday night! We luckily didn't have to wait for a table but people were still coming in and waiting for a table at 9pm. We tried the charred cabbage, tacos: beef, cod, and mushroom, and chips and beans. All were super flavorful with great texture and all very filling. Favorites were definitely the mushroom tacos and charred cabbage. The herbs and char on the cabbage was perfect and loved the spices/peppery flavors of the mushrooms. We got the Spanish 75 and spicy mezcal margarita for drinks. Highly recommend the margarita. I like how you can choose tequila or mezcal and spicy or non spicy for the margarita. Service was friendly, nice ambiance, and definitely a popular place. I recommend and hope to be back again!,Got takeout after seeing great reviews here and we were not disappointed.  The deserts were not an option ordering online, so I ordered the tres leches in person.  After I was already rung up they informed they didn't have anymore.  Toasted coconut flan was the available desert I was happyTo have it instead.  A few minutes later while I waited for it they let me know they refunded the charge for desert.  Wasn't necessary but definitely appreciated.  We also had the roasted carrotTostada, asparagus tostada, and hen of the woods tacos.All of them were delicious.  Homemade and hand made tortillas were perfect consistency and flavor.  Each dish had different salsas, cremas, and/or sauces and they were all very tasty.  Just the right amount of spice (we don't have high spice tolerance).  The toasted coconut flan was very good as well.  The tostadas had enough crunch to stay together when biting into it but didn't crumble.   Great vegan choices .  They also have meat dishes I have to assume would be great based on our experience.The space was simple and clean.  Plenty of bar seating and a bunch of small tables plus a parklet.  We will return for more.  Great service and delicious food, and the price was pretty good as well.,Really amazing food, terrific staff, delicious drinks, and the vibe inside and outside are superb. Love this addition to the neighborhood.,Great service, drinks were made really well, tacos we're authentic and delish. Nice atmosphere, highly recommended,As a vegetarian the only decision I need to make in a Mexican restaurant is between black beans and refried beans! This is definitely a different kind of eating experience and between the two of us, didn't even exhaust the vegetarian choices.The tacos are something else. Apparently they make their own masa. Everything we tried (asparagus tostada, wild mushroom tacos, black bean starter with chips) was amazing and tasted very different. Add mezcal based cocktails and it's hard not to come back again. My only complaint is that the portions are small and the prices not that small but this is San Francisco and the food is creative and executed well. Can't have it all.,Delicious Mexican inspired tasty treats for the veterinarian or the omnivores! Don't skip on the bar program with some serious creative drinks. We loved the melon salada and all the veggie taco options. Also the flan - Yum. Service is great here and they have that contact less pay options, which still takes a bit to really adjust to... good stuff!,The ambience outside is really nice especially in the evening. The staff is very friendly. We got seated within 2 minutes. The best items we ordered for the table were the chips with bean dip and tres leches for dessert. However, for main course, the beef tacos were okay and mushroom tacos were kind of bland. The drinks we ordered weren't anything special either.,Great indoor vibe and warm & cozy outdoor seating. The tortilla chips were well done, crispy and salty. Drinks were strong and yummy, matching the bold and fresh entrees. Wonderful family-run restaurant!,I really don't get the hype for this place...-Overpriced-tiny portions-my friend is allergic to sesame seeds, we told the waitress but they kept bringing sauces that had sesame seeds...-they messed up the order-drinks were OK, not memorableAnother bougie place for those impressed by the presentation.  We went there because some of us are vegans but even the menu was quite limited.Will go back to my digs in the Mission with real Mexican food for a fraction of the price with tasty food made with love.No otra vez.,Ordered the beef tacos and the aquachile because I wasn't certain about portion size. Both dishes were ready very quickly (ordered to go, ready ~10mins from ordering, during dinner time too), and absolutely amazing. Nice kick in both, but neither were too spicy either. Despite being only two tacos, they were overloaded--if ordering for two, I'd do an order of tacos for each person and split the aquachile, and you'd definitely be full. I can't wait to try their other dishes.,Amazing new addition to the neighborhoodI've only eaten the hen of the woods tacos because they are so good I can't get anything else. One of the best veg tacos I've ever eaten. Desserts and totopos also delish Friendly service, great food, tons of vegetarian and gluten free options... what's not to like?,great food, atmosphere, drinks and staff! The bartenders were super dope, helpful and friendly. We got the mussels with chorizo for a snack and it was delicious. Highly recommend,Rating reflects on food and prices. Restaurant is a good size, with authentic decor surrounding you. Hospitable bartender and staff.Tried most of their menu and wasn't very impressed. Food came out quick which explains most dishes were luke warm served with cold tortillas. StartersChips + Salsa- needs more chips on the plate. FYI You're going to order more chips. The salsas were flavorful!Mussels- presented nicely but old, re heated, luke warm Aquachile- flavorful, lime and good amount of spice. Charred Cabbage- good flavor, nice char Tacos ( you only get 2)Beef Tacos- meat was chewy, fat melts in your mouth, luke warm tortilla Hen of Woods- good but mushrooms were luke warm and tortilla was cold Cod Tostada- no flavor Main PlateAl Pastor- luke warm, rice had no flavor, al pastor was a little tough, pineapple chunks were refreshing. Puréed beans were okay, served cold. DessertFlan- yummy custard topped with toasted coconut! Delicious! Would order 4 of these!,Hmm. Food was pretty tasty," but this is expensive for what you get.Recommend Asparagus tostada and Hen of the Woods mushroom tacos-both were very flavorful. Lots of vegetarian options. Friendly service.Recommend avoiding totopos which were was just """"chips and salsa dip""""-- Nopalito has a much more interesting and flavorful version. Sweat potato tacos was just okay. Also the upper back area is VERY dark-depending on where you sit you can barely see your table mates. Sit out front or in the front section inside.",obsessed. got some tacos and frijolito to go and everything was SO GOOD. i was most excited to try the mushroom tacos but actually the sweet potato and beef taco were my fave - absolutely perfect flavors.freshly made chips for the frijolito were excellent. also got the corn tres leches which was delish.staff was super nice and they gave me plenty of plasticware / napkins without having to ask,Good drinks, amazing vegetarian friendly food, super friendly staff! Highly recommend!,Absolutely delicious. We had the frijoles, the cabbage, carrot tostada and beef tacos (pictured) and margaritas. Everything was so, so good. Crisp, fresh veggies, crispy AND tender beef, toothsome tortillas made from hand-ground heritage masa. Margaritas we perfect. Excellent.,What a shame. Our programmed order was 20 min late.. when we got home 2 items were missing. Both of their phone numbers are not being answered. I had to drive back to let them know.. when I asked for a refund they only refunded half... so on Father's Day I ate cold food after an hour + of travel and wait times.. I would have posted nothing had they refunded me for the meal. But bad customer service is not acceptable The beef tacos were very good but way too much avocado sauce. Everything else was meh even the mixed drinks,Wonderful Feeling.... Was this past year a dream?Lovely place, warm, friendly, efficient staff.Oh yes, the food was also tasty.Try it.,Beef tacos are amazing and the margarita I ordered was also very good. Definitely recommend!,Had some snacks and a beverage at Mexico in a Bottle, and the beverages and snacks were the best at the event, and some of the best I've had in SF.  Can't wait to visit the bricks and mortar location!,The folks from Son's Addition knock another one out of the park! Very exciting to see a new, trendy yet approachable restaurant open in the neighborhood. Staff had the perfect balance of attentiveness and was very helpful with navigating the menu and answering any questions my husband and I had. Slow cooked beef and hen of the woods mushroom tacos for the win!!! Seriously, these were delicious - get them. Also really (and surprisingly!) enjoyed the charred cabbage. All washed down with a fantastic margarita. Can't wait to come back and try more on the menu!,"Saw this in the chronicle food section and knew I had to visit to try the charred cabbage.  It was so deliciousa.   Also good was """"everything"""".  Cod tostada.  Kamanchi!!  Beef tacos.  And the thick and salty chips.  Service was great.",Otra's beef tacos were the tastiest meal I've eaten all year. The pork shoulder and aquachile were flavorful and wonderful. They're not doing delivery (which I understand given the way the delivery companies gouge the restaurants) but if you want to do pickup they will bring it out to your car so you don't need to find parking. Lovely restaurant from really lovely folks -- we're big fans of their other restaurant Son's Addition as well.,Pretty good spot! The meat dishes were all really good. I was not a fan of the grilled cabbage or the brussels sprouts that were soggy by the time I got home. The beef tacos were really good as it was the pastor plate. I would've loved to stay in and have some of their cocktails but maybe next time.,Otra is interesting because they have no meat options besides fish and beef. I only eat chicken, so I had to choose the asparagus tostada, which definitely was not filling, but was well-prepared. If you're looking for variety in meat options, this place was not great. Chips and salsa as an app were great, though. And service + ambiance was wonderful too. Just not super suitable for my diet!,I came here with my parents who sort of don't believe in sharing dishes/trying interesting things so I need to come back, but I had the Wild Mushroom Tacos and they really blew me away. We also got a salsa sampler that I basically drank. Tortilla chips were thin, salted to perfection, and very addictive too. The margarita was bangin. As far as I'm concerned Otra has absolutely nailed it, but it's new and popular so getting a table can sometimes be a pain. I'll be sticking around until the hype dies down though and I'm sure they'll still be killing it.,Playful modern Mexican food 4.5*. A rare find in SF. Great food and service at the bar.Kampachi featuring jicama for texture and unique miso lime marinade. Dill and poppy for garnish making this a playful fresh summer dish. Be warned this does have some serious heat, could use an element to balance the heat.Hen of the woods tacos on heirloom tacos shells made in house was the highlight! Great fired taste with balanced flavor from the crema and queso finished with a bit of hot oil.,I found this cute gem when I was up in SF visiting friends. I walked in and the ambience blew me away. They had all these unique touches like black and white pictures of the chef's family and vibrant banners strung across the restaurant (sorry they told me the proper name of the banners but I can't remember). My favorite touch were the amazing skulls on either side of the bar! More importantly, on to food. Some of the table's favorites included the aguachile (sashimi grade yellowtail with a nice kick), the roasted sweet potato tacos, and the mussels that had the most divine broth. The selling point of the restaurant is the house made tortillas made with heirloom corn. One of the staff members told me all about heirloom corn and I was blown away to know that the restaurant really thought through every detail to create the most amazing food. And finally, the drinks. They literally have every tequila and mezcal you could ever want...  and ones you didn't even know you wanted until you're savoring it in front of you. The house made syrup for spicy margaritas was a big hit and I loved the Smokey Paloma as well. All in all, it's looking like I need to get myself back to up SF because I can't stop thinking about this place!!,Amazing food and adorable, cozy atmosphere. Two of us split the mussels, hen of the woods tacos, and the roasted carrot tostados. It was all fantastic and plenty of food. The drinks were strong and delicious too.,We ordered the spicy house margaritas with a tajin rim, the aquachile and frijolitos con chips to start and I had the sweet potato tacos as my main dish. The aquachile was spicy but delicious, and the frijolitos was a black bean dip which was a good contrast to the spicy aquachile. The sweet potato tacos (came with 2) were unique and unlike any tacos I'd had before and so delicious. This was the perfect amount of food for the two of us considering we weren't super hungry. I'll definitely be back to try some of the other items on the menu. This would be a great spot for a date night or girls night out.,Yummy and fun energy. We've been missing something this lively in the neighborhood. Drinks and food were delicious. It was very loud and crowded in a good way.,Nice patio area here and great tacos. We love the beef tacos!! There are also good vegetarian options!,Love it here! One of my top favorite restaurants in SF! Almost the entire menu is gluten free so great place to go with Celiac,Great food!  Creative spin on Mexican classics. Everything was fresh and innovative, with very reasonable pricing. Definitely coming back,This place would be an easy 5 stars thanks to its great music, awesome decor and their aguachile is quality. Unfortunately, for a bar that claims to have good drinks," you either need to retrain your bartenders or hire new ones. The drinks have zero effort out into them. You're supposed to shake for 10-30 seconds per drink and these amigos are spending 3.5 seconds per shake which leads to a mess of a cocktail with none of the ingredients properly blended together. If you upped the cocktail game this spot would kick ass.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lokma,"What a great find! We had been trying to get reservations at another place nearby but couldn't, and then I saw Lokma had great reviews so we went - and what a great decision!I had the homemade lemonade and the meat dumplings. All were delicious, the atmosphere was cozy and friendly, and the service was great. I have already recommended it to a few people.,You had me at Simit!I finally went for brunch. I'm obsessed with Turkey so when I saw a picture of the Simit, I knew I had to go.We went for brunch around 11.30. We were seated right away outside. There are a lot of tables, the restroom is super clean and nice. Service was good, friendly. You can see the menu on the door or use the QR code. The orange juice. It was fresh with pulp, very natural. We had the Turkish breakfast for 2 and we shared a Simit (Turkish bagel I've been dying to try).It comes with olives, feta, scrambled eggs with Turkish sausage, warm Pita, muhammara (tomato and red pepper dip), tomatoes, clotted cream with honey, fruit and Hazelnut spread (yummm).The Simit came with some olives, tomatoes and cucumber. It has exactly what I was expecting.I wish they have Şekerpare (Can't find it anywhere so I have to make it). Turkey cuisine is one of my favorites. It has a lot to offer. I'm so happy to find places like this one. Not close to home but totally worth the commute.I'll comeback to try new things. Teşekkürler!,For starters, we had the Spreads, wam Mediterranean olives, Papas Bravas, zucchini dolma, and the beet salad. Everything was delicious....Especially the papas. It had such a great taste. We also ready enjoyed the Spreads. The tzatziki' was creamier than any we've had before.For the big bites, we had the Manti, the lamb chops, the grilled chicken, the halibut and the Presidio salad. I've never had Manti before and it was really good. The lam chops was a bit over cooked and more burnt than I cared for but the taste was good. All the other dishes were very tasty.For desert, we had the baklava and the Burma and the Revani with Turkish black tea. The deserts were okay but we enjoyed the tea.The server was very nice. Will definitely be back!The breakfast menu looks very interesting. We might see if we can head back in this direction and give that a try.,So glad I got to try this spot! I heard a lot about the pancakes so my friend and I decided to order the Sunrise Combo because it's both savory and sweet:  2 Greek yogurt pancakes with blueberry compote served with scrambled eggs and Turkish beef sausage. My friend was able to substitute the sausage with potatoes which was very nice of them to do. The pancakes were so fluffy, you must order the pancakes if you come here.  We also got a Muhammara spread to share, it was more than enough to share with 2-3 people. Great flavor and came with warm pita. This was my first time having Turkish Coffee so I wasn't expecting so much coffee grounds. Just don't swish the cup around as there are grounds at the bottom. Not sure if I would get it again.,Went to Lokma for brunch, made reservations on Yelp before as the line was very long for walk ins. We got seated outside in order to cut down on wait time. We got the vegetarian pita wrap and the eggs/pancake combo. The wrap was good, it could have used a little bit more spice/flavoring. The veggies tasted fresh. The eggs and pancakes were also good - I wish the pancakes came with more seasoning/toppings.The high note of the meal were the breakfast potatoes that came with my wrap, they were so so delicious and so well seasoned!Will definitely come back for the potatoes!,This is a unique brunch experience in SF, perfect for a group of 2-4 people. If your group is more than 4 people, it will be hard to fit into this restaurant, as it is small and cozy. I recommend putting your group on the yelp waitlist about 30-45 minutes before you arrive and give yourself ample time to find parking. There is residential parking and paid meter parking in front of the restaurant. My girlfriends and I were able to get seated after a short wait. Turkish breakfast and is fun and interactive. What we got: - Turkish Breakfast for two: This platter is like a Turkish Charcuterie Board and perfect for sharing. It has Pastirma, Tomato and Cucumbers, Olives, fruit, walnut, feta, honey, and scrambled eggs with feta. The eggs themselves were more on the bland side, but it pairs well with everything else that was included. - Sunrise Combo: Greek Yogurt Pancakes with Blueberry and scrambled eggs. The pancakes were soft and bouncy. The blueberry compote/jam was also perfect and not too sweet. This didn't need any syrup. - Turkish Black Tea: Tastes just like regular black tea. I would pass on this and get the Turkish Coffee instead. I 100% recommend this place for a calm and cozy brunch in SF.,This is a cute and friendly little Mediterranean cafe on a corner in the outer Richmond. We stopped in for breakfast/brunch over the weekend and were not disappointed.YAY, they still have the parklet so we could dine outside. Be sure to use the waitlist option!,Guys let me tell you, I've always been a big fan of brunch and have been to many brunch restaurants, but this restaurant still managed to IMPRESS ME. This place serves Turkish brunch so starting off it was already really unique. Honestly I think the best way to explain the food is just through the pictures and you all can judge for yourself ;)  usually if I get eggs Benedict or sth for brunch I kinda feel guilty and heavy since I would be consuming a lot of butter, but this place made me feel so healthy.The service was also really good, though we did have to wait a bit to get seated (30 mins?). The inside of the restaurant is not really big but definitely cozy.I'd say this place is kinda like a hidden gem and would recommend anyone that is looking for some unique brunch!,Walked - in at 6 pm on a Friday and was able to get seated right away. I ordered the Braised Short Rib with mashed potatoes and it was TOO GOOD! If I could teleport back in time and relive this exact moment I would. The meat just melted into your mouth. The mashed potatoes were PERFECT. This place is a little pricy but worth every penny. Stunning presentation. I haven't been to many Turkish restaurants and this definitely set the bar high. Will be coming back!,Another enjoyable dinner at Lokma. Service is consistently welcoming, friendly and attentive. All dishes that we have tried for two visit have not been disappointing. The lamb chop was DELICIOUS! Beets salad truly opened up the appetite! Stuffed zucchini, Mantis, etc. Try it all when you can. The restaurant is not big but cozy. Always end the meal with a cup of Turkish coffee. This restaurant and the team will not disappoint.,Lokma might be worth a visit if you're here for their Mediterranean brunch items. Otherwise, I don't recommend. I got their sunrise combo and the pancakes were extremely dry. Some syrup or more compote would have helped but I wasn't a fan of the rubbery texture. I love and appreciate fluffy pancakes and this just was not it. The scramble and sujuk were good but overall this was a miss,Randomly came to this spot and what amazing luck! This place was so good. We were sat outside and were served by a very kind staff member. I ordered the Turkish coffee which was really yummy! I was not aware how small it would be so be aware of that when ordering! I ordered the sunrise combo and it was heavenly. The eggs and potatoes were seasoned perfectly and the pancakes were the perfect combination of tart from the yogurt and sweet from the blueberry topping. Truly a wonderful meal,A wonderful brunch spot with extraordinarily fast service and delicious dishes! Turlu Omelet: 5/5 stars! Wonderfully cooked eggs wrapped around savory, rich vegetables. The eggplant was surprisingly my favorite. The potatoes were absolutely delightful -- crispy and mealy without being overly oily. Would get this time and time again.Greek Yogurt pancakes: 4.5/5 stars! It's thick and almost sticky in your mouth, and the yogurt sauce made it even more luxurious. It's not very sweet (a green in my book), but it's definitely a heavy dish. I wish there was a little bit more fruit or whipped cream for lightness.Turkish coffee: 4.5/ 5 stars. Thick, chocolatey, exquisite! I've never had Turkish coffee before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. The grinds at the end are supposed to stay there, oops! I wasn't sure if there would be a round 2 where you rehydrate the grinds. In any case, I'd get it again.It's in the Richmond and a little out of the heart of the city, but definitely worth the trek.,This place had surprisingly good food. I had multiple friends recommend this place to me! Food looks relatively average but the plain looking eggs were very flavorful and the mushroom soup was creamy but not heavy. The Turkish Breakfast was a really yummy assortment of savory and sweet spread. Definitely recommend checking this place out!,After many visits,  I must say Lokma is on top of my list of best restaurants in SF. I find myself returning again and again. A hidden gem for locals. Consistently impeccable in food and service. Furthermore, Lokma is cozy, classy and elegant.This go around we had:Calamari - tender, sweet calamari with delicious tomato almond cous cous.Braised short rib - fork tender short rib served on top of mash and mushrooms.Karniyarik - tender flavorful ground beef stuffed in eggplant and grilled to perfection.Other delicious dishes I'd recommend trying:-spreads-dolmas-watermelon salad-papas bravas-grilled lamb kofte -lamb chops-Alaskan halibut-Lokma burger-Presidio saladThank you Chef and service team. Special thanks to Sertan. See y'all next time.,Lokma is a restaurant that my friend suggested that we go to, as they had wanted to check it out for some time. We came as a group of around 6 in the early evening, and although the inside was full we were able to be seated immediately outdoors. The seating there was still pretty nice, and thankfully they had a structure around the table to block us from the wind. The waiters were friendly, and definitely very accommodating to us.    For the food, I decided to get the Braised Short Rib for my entree and a spread of the Tomato Hummus for an appetizer. The short rib was plated very nicely, and the quality of it was great! Each ingredient was cooked very well, and it was a good amount of food for the price. The tomato hummus was also tasty, and they were able to give refills on the pita bread as well. You definitely won't be disappointed by the food here.    Overall, though I haven't been to many Turkish restaurants I have to say that I really enjoyed my meal here! Highly recommend checking it out if you're in the area.,Had a really solid Thursday evening dinner at Lokma - delicious food, cozy atmosphere for a meal with a friend. There was plenty of outdoor seating, and despite the cold weather, a solid amount of heating to keep us warm.The service was excellent - I dropped a knife at one point, and didn't even have to ask/wait more than a minute before it was replaced. Really attentive and kind staff!I ordered the Turlu & Cous Cous, which was delicious and flavorful. It was one of the only vegetarian options on the menu, but did not disappoint at all - the combination of tzatziki and roasted vegetables was quite divine! A bit on the expensive side given that the portion sizes weren't huge, but overall the combination with atmosphere and service made this well worth a visit :),One of my favorite brunch experiences in the City! I shared the Turkish breakfast and the Greek Yogurt Pancakes.Turkish Breakfast: Pastirma (air-dried cured beef), 4 scrambled eggs with Turkish sausage, feta, olives, fresh fruit, muhammara, tomatoes, cucumber, kaymak (clotted cream) & honey & warm pita. The muhammara spread is my favorite item at Lokma and definitely worth trying.Greek Yogurt Pancakes: Seasonal fruit, honey, blueberry compote, toasted almonds. Fluffy with a slight chewy texture. Wonderful tart flavor from the fruit and yogurt.This spot does get very busy so try to come early for brunch.,Great catch up with friends at lokma on a Friday night. We made a reservation for outdoor seating and it was really nice. We thought it would be cold but lokma has good heating and blankets available for every chair. They were filming ""Check Please"" at the time we were there so it was fun to pretend to be chatting while the cameras were in our faces - the host did warn us that they were filming when we entered. We shared some apps - trio of dips and papas bravas. Both were delicious. As for mains we had the chicken, stuffed eggplant and the burger. They were good but not mind blowing and more than enough to share around. Heard they have good brunch too,Planned a breakfast/lunch outing with the goal of going to Lokma in SF with girlfriends. Great experience in driving there from South Bay and finding a parking space across the restaurant on a week day!!Order the Turkish breakfast for two and the yogurt pancakes, hot tea and Turkish coffee for 3 of us. The Turkish breakfast was delightful and we enjoyed every item on the plate. The pancakes were very good, but not amazing like so many reviewers had raved about. We loved the experience...Our Turkish server was delightful and we enjoyed chatting with her. She did a great job and conversation was delightful. We will definitely come back and try other menu items.,Great service especially on a Sunday brunch times! The yelp reservations wasn't working online, but they sat us pretty quickly. One of the last days of the rain of the last two weeks, so it was a nice experience being outside:),We found here on a weekday night, was pleasantly surprised about the ambiance & food. A table for two, we walked in without reservation.  Mantı & karnıyarık were quite good. The service was prompt. We were lucky about parking, street parking was available just across the restaurant -nothing going on there on weekdays. I plan to come back for a more thorough investigation of the menu.,Best place for the girls brunch place! The wait time was actually not that long considering how popular it is and the food quality was really good! Cute Turkish code and the best dish here is definitely Turkish breakfast!,My friend and I met for breakfast here this morning and absolutely loved it.Service was quick and friendly. We sat inside at a two top, and had a wonderful time.We both ordered the ""Sunrise Combo"" which comes with two small pancakes topped with Greek yogurt and berries, and scrambled eggs with Turkish sausage. The pancakes were so light and fluffy, and the sausage in the eggs was seriously delicious.We both ordered slightly sweet Turkish coffee, and I had a perfect mimosa.This place gets super popular so I recommend going on the early side.,The server was the sweetest. So attentive and always checked on us throughout our meal. I had such a positive experience at Lokma. The ambiance of the restaurant during dinner time makes for such a cute little date night spot. The restaurant is not very big, which really gives it a homey vibe. I felt like I was just eating dinner causally at home but with far more unique and delicious dishes, oh and can't forget... the great service! For food, I was able to try the Trio Spreads which includes the tomato hummus, baba ganoush, and tzatziki with house made pita bread. All three dips were so yummy but the tomato hummus was unlike any hummus I've had before- definitely recommend trying this. I was also able to share the Manti and Braised Short Ribs. Manti was not what I expected because it was definitely more like a pasta (tortellini like) than dumplings. This definitely was not a plate I could've finished all on my own, so I'm glad I shared this dish with someone. As for the braised short ribs, this was probably the star of the night. How did they make that meat just melt in my mouth like that???,Variety of vegetarian options: 5/5Love lokma! Fresh squeezed orange juice is awesome and the bal and kaymak is a huge hit and tasted really authentic. Very generous with their portion sizes, and I think it's a great spot for eating family style. It's also not a bad wait for a Sunday brunch compared to other places. Hoping they add a shakshuka to their menu!,It is our go to place for brunch. Love the Turkish breakfast and  coffee.And thank you for the staffs who were trying to figure out our seatings in busy hours.,The Turkish food at Lokma is beautifully presented and the Mediterranean diet is no doubt healthy. I came today with my bf and dog for brunch and we enjoyed the experience.Seating: Beautiful interior setting and outdoor seating Food: The Turkish Breakfast for two ($35) is popular and offers a taste of everything. It came with pita, 4 scrambled eggs with Turkish sausage, and a plate filled with fruit, olives, cucumber and tomatoes, cured meat, feta, kaymak (clotted cream) with honey and a red dip.Service: Excellent. The server even brought water for our dog.Overall, it was a nice experience to brunch. I loved the serve ware, service, and decor. Food was great, but nothing out of this world. I would come back to try lunch and dinner items.,Great neighborhood brunch spot serving Turkish & Mediterranean breakfast. Located in Richmond, the restaurant is super cute & cozy and great place for a chill weekend brunch. We came on a Sunday morning at 10am and had no wait - They also offer Yelp Waitlist, which you can join in advance (noting your time of arrival) to help shorten your wait time.We ordered the Turkish Breakfast, Turlu Omelette, and Menemen. Highly recommend the Turkish Breakfast - It's HUGE (meant to serve 2 people) and comes with so many delicious sides. The kaymak (clotted cream) & honey and muhammara dips were particular standouts and taste great with the pita.Would definitely recommend this brunch spot - Cozy spot, great food, and good service all around!,Came here on a Saturday around 12:30pm. Despite the amount of people, there were still a few tables open. There's a lot of outdoor seating as well as indoor. I tried the sunrise combo, the bal and kaymak, and a Turkish coffee.The sunrise combo was a good mix of a sweet and savory breakfast/brunch. The Greek yogurt pancakes were perfectly fluffy, and the knife cut through easily. The blueberries were sweet and the tartness of the Greek yogurt provided a nice contrast. The sujuk provided a nice saltiness to the scrambled eggs. They are a bit tougher than normal sausage that I'm used to, but I enjoyed them. The bal and kaymak was delicious. I love clotted cream and having them with pita and honey was a whole new experience. It was difficult trying to find a good ratio of honey to clotted cream as the honey does get too sweet. The pita was soft and surprisingly a good way to pair the two spreads. The Turkish coffee was just what I needed for a late morning start. I got it lightly sweetened with a side of cream. The coffee was smooth and filtered well. I didn't end up using most of the cream. The prices aren't bad at all considering it's SF. Everything was under $20, there was a good portion, and the food is good.,So delicious! Would love to come back and try their brunch. Highly recommend the creamy mushroom soup, trio spreads, calamari, and baklava.,Lokma is always a good idea for brunch! If you love Mediterranean food and something that's comforting and lightweight, this is the place for you. I'm so happy Lokma opened up in the Richmond near my parent's home. The hummus is yummy and small bites delectable. Grab some Turkish coffee and enjoy good company. It's got wonderful outdoor dining space that make it easy to bring your dog as well! The wait can sometimes be long, but if you show up early, they usually can seat you pretty quickly.,My husband and I were looking for a late Sunday lunch before going to the Legion of Honor for a day date. We are happy we found and gave Lokma a chance.We did not make reservations, but they had a table for two at about 1 PM. I was hoping my husband would go for the Turkish Breakfast for 2, and he did!We left saying - even though we live in the East Bay - that we would make a trip back. The pitas were fresh and hot, and the eggs wonderful with a spicy sausage folded in and the potatos bravas (though a side) were flavorful with just the right amount of spice. The condiments included in the breakfast (see below) were amazing! I wish I could eat like this every day! I especially loved the clotted cream, which made me order extra pitas to lap it up.The staff friendly, attentive, unpretentious and funny. We loved it.,My husband and I came to Lokma for Turkish brunch. We ordered two Turkish coffees, menemen, clotted cream with honey and a Lokma Burger. The menemen was a 3/5. The menemen is basically scrambled eggs with tomatoes. If you like the sweet taste of tomatoes, then you may like it...I could barely taste the eggs. The clotted cream with honey and flatbread was my favorite! Felt like I was having a nice charcuterie treat without the meat, but better! The honey and clotted cream are a perfect combination! My husband loved the Turkish coffee so much he ordered two! The Lokma burger was a delicious. 5/5.,Lokma Ratings: 4.1/5 Food: 4.5/5 - Made a spontaneous trip to Lokma with roomies for brunch last Saturday afternoon, because I always wanted to try their Greek yogurt pancakes. They are phenomenal and low key the BEST pancakes I have tried in SF, but their other dishes were quite standard. Go see the descriptions of the items my boyfriend and I shared below. - Sunrise Combo [GET]: Sweet and savory are the best brunch combo I think. It comes with two Greek yogurt pancakes topped with blueberry compote and yogurt. Pancakes are thick and dense yet still fluffy and had an amazing texture. I freaking LOVE the pancake and yogurt combo, because it's tangy and compliments the blueberry compote so so well. MUST TRY, and mind blowing moments. I will eat my pancakes with Greek yogurt now, instead of whipped cream or butter. The sujuk (Turkish beef sausage) was new to me, but savory fits well with the scrambled eggs, but nothing too impressive. It was buttery and lightly scramble, but not a fan of the mushy texture. - Menemen [GET]: Scrambled eggs with organic tomatoes and sweet peppers topped with feta cheese. It is a tangy, sour, and an acidic dish, but still packed with lots of flavors and served with pita bread on the side. It reminds me a lot of an Asian dish I eat growing up as a kid (scramble eggs with tomatoes, IYKYK). The pitas are thinly sliced, super airy and fluffy, great way to eat it with the menemen. I would say if you are a big texture person, then this might not be the dish for you; it got an overall a very soft and mushy texture, since the veggies are cooked very well done. Ambiance: 4/5 - We sat indoor. There's a small coffee bar and plants on the windowsills. Ambiance is chill and casual, interior is definitely smaller and probably hard to seat large parties, but there's some outdoor dining available, so if weather is nice too then it's a great option to do that. Interior is bright, clean, and intimate, definitely a cute spot to go out with girlfriends. Parking might be tough though. Price: 4/5 - We got the sunrise combo and menemen for $16 and $15 respectively. The prices are pretty average compared to most brunch places in SF. The portions are decent and beautifully presented and flavorful, not too huge but enough to keep the both of us satisfied for a good time. Service: 4/5 - The service was great and top-notched. The staffs are friendly, kind and provides top services. Our water glasses and coffee were never empty, and they checked-in with us to make sure we are good to go. The food came out within 20 minutes after placing them, fresh and hot. It was a great experience. BLUF: Just go and get their PANCAKES. Say Less and Go. Lokma serves authentic Turkish food, and overall it's pretty amazing, but their Greek yogurt pancakes blew my mind. I will go back to Lokma anytime just to have their Greek yogurt pancakes again.,Actual Rating: 3.5 starsCute little place in Richmond district of SF. We went for a weekend brunch and there was no wait. We were seated right away and we opted for an indoor table. Service was pretty quick and great. We started off with some fresh OJ and I went for the Turkish coffee coz I had never had one. The Turkish coffee was a bit too much for me and it was also a bit grainy at the bottom of the cup so I did not enjoy it much. For food, we went for the muhammara dip, chicken sandwich, menemen and falafel wrap. Out of all these dishes we tried, the only dish that stood out was the chicken sandwich. Rest of the food was very average for the price we paid.,One of the best Mediterranean food in the hood. I've tried many places in the city but Lokma's food is definitely at the top of the list. Must-tries: the Turkish dumplings, the zucchini dolmas. Friendly staff. Service was fast on a busy Saturday night. I'll definitely come back!,I really enjoyed my brunch at Lokma. I remember hearing about their opening, which unfortunately coincided with my move to a different neighborhood. So I'm glad I got the opportunity to dine here recently. Whenever I passed by, I always saw a full restaurant with people waiting for a table. And now I know why. The food is delicious!  I ordered the breakfast sandwich, that came with patatas bravas. The eggs were scrambled, and so fluffy!  The ciabatta was nicely grilled, so it gave it a smoky flavor.  And the potatoes were super crispy on the outside, and fluffy inside. I also ordered a Greek yogurt pancake on the side. I knew the sandwich was going to be filling, but I really wanted to try the pancake.  No regrets- it was so yummy! I liked that it was topped with a berry compote and Greek yogurt. The pancake itself was thick. I imagine the pancake entree would be very filling. I also ordered a Turkish coffee, and that too was delightful! I'm sensitive to caffeine, but I wanted a jolt of energy after a long day of school the day before.  I felt it after a few sips. They have indoor and outdoor seating. We asked for the first available, which was an outdoor table. The weather was so nice, that I'm glad we were able to sit outside. It was the two of us, so the table was small, but just enough to fit all of our dishes. Service was top notch!I recommend making time to find parking because street parking in that part of the Richmond is difficult. Also, utilize the Yelp Waitlist because this restaurant is popular. I'd love to come back here again for dinner.,Loved this place when it opened, but it's gone massively downhill. Portions are small, coffee is weak. To top it off, we came as a party of two, were told we couldn't have one of the many open tables because they were saving them in case parties of four arrived, and then a party of two who arrived after us was seated at a table. After pointing this out and again being declined a table, we decided to leave. Done with this place. Too bad.,And again!  100% every time. It may be difficult to tell from my reviews of this place, but I'm actually quite critical. I grew up in the restaurant business. Our last visit was the day after our vacation. Which clearly didn't match up to this for dining expectations. So. Lokma. Thank you!,Summary:Solid brunch that's fun and visually appealingDetails:* Two or more of you? Try the Turkish breakfast for a bit of fun: you get a mix of small bites and flavors, along with a heartier side of eggs and meat* Side of roasted chili was great, and while the sujuk is good, it's quite salty on its own (so eat it with everything else provided)* Nothing in the set on its own is mind-blowing, but it came together well as a whole* Blueberry pancakes were surprisingly solid, and served with a healthy dollop of Greek yogurt instead of butter/cream* Outdoor seating available, both covered and uncoveredAccessibility:Can't speak for the inside, but there are plenty of accessible tables in their outdoor seating setup!,We tried Lokma while staying in a nearby AirBnB and really enjoyed it.We enjoyed 2 entrees, dessert, (Baklava) wine and beer. I especially recommend the Karniyarik (Stuffed eggplant).Friendly, quick serviceGood foodNot rushedModern decorIndoor/outdoor seatingNot pretentiousSee my photos of our experience.,I was super excited to try this place b/c of the Turkish coffee and Greek yogurt pancakes!! We put ourselves on the waitlist on a Sunday morning and got to the top pretty quickly. We ordered the flan and Turkish coffee to start off our breakfast -- both were tasty! For entrees, we ordered the Greek yogurt pancakes and the Turlu omelette. My bf loved the yogurt pancakes, and I thought they were yummy as well but could have used some syrup! The turlu omelette wasn't our favorite but the ingredients do taste fresh. Overall a solid spot.,While many people may come to this restaurant for its brunch, we happened to visit in the evening for the dinner menu. We were able to try a multitude of their dishes, beginning with the shishito peppers, olives, and the Bal & Kaymak. Of these, I would highly recommend the Bal & Kaymak, which features fresh pita accompanied by a delicious tart and sweet cream/honey sauce. Many of the signature dishes feature either a cream or yogurt-like sauce that gives the food an extra dimension of flavor you don't typically see at many of the common Mediterranean restaurants in the city. For the main, I would recommend the Manti, which features small bite-sized dumplings stuffed with meat (similar to gnocchi or small ravioli), smothered in a layer of garlic yogurt sauce. For desserts, we tried both the flan and revani. As a whole, the desserts lean toward the sweet side, so if you do decide to order, a tea/coffee may help balance the flavor.As a whole, Lokma is an excellent dining experience and well-worth it's own trip out to the Richmond District!,Service: meh. Stood around and nobody helped us. People walked by us like we were invisible. Walked up to someone at the back and they told us to keep waiting. Food: meh. Pita is fresh, the Turkish breakfast sounds good on the menu but for $35 for 2, so approx $18 per person it's not very filling.Dessert: Flan had a bad texture. Their Turkish cake was way too wet.Bill was $95 bucks with tip. Wouldn't come back. :( Disappointed.,The restaurant clarified that they do in fact bring you food you didn't order and you can just send it back ???  Regarding bread, which many restaurants provide for free, this is a most dishonest practice.  I definitely wont be back. And for those who do go - make sure you know whether you are being charged and how much for whatever is brought to your table, including bread.  It simply is not honest to bring food people didn't order and then charge them for it.  Thank you for the response - yeah I do understand now your dirty tricks. I DID NOT order a ""side of pita bread"" but it was on by bill.,Lovely Turkish restaurant located in Outer Richmond. The food was bright, floral, and fresh without sacrificing any flavor. Portions are on the smaller end. The staff here are welcoming and attentive. I enjoyed sitting right by the window. I'll be coming back to explore the wine list.,Lokma is officially one of my fav brunch spots in the Bay Area! We've been here a few times and tried quite a few dishes. Everything is delicious so far! Today's highlight is definitely the Greek yoghurt pancake - super fluffy with subtle sweetness. The scrambled eggs are simple but with just the right texture. One of the highlights for my husband among all our visits was the lamb meatball wrap if you're a lamb eater.Aside from the great dishes, the deco is cute and comfy. They also have spacious outdoor seating. Although they're definitely popular, we always join the waitlist in advance and never need to wait more than 10 mins once arrive.,Finally made it to Lokma this Sunday after having it on my list for a long time! Have to say that I'm disappointed that I waited so long to go! All of us were super happy with the food and service. The best part though was that we didn't have to wait on a Sunday morning for brunch - unheard of in SF.We started with the trio of dips, which did not disappoint. Even the hummus was great, and I'm normally not a big hummus fan. My boyfriend and I split the turlu omelette, the meneman scramble, and a greek pancake because people said you had to try them. The turlu omelette was by far our favorite! I would eat that every morning. We probably wouldn't do the meneman again. The greek pancake was definitely also great- I'm just not a huge fan of blueberry.

rall, a great experience with great food and good service!,I ordered a plate of their grilled chicken plate (dinner) to go yesterday. It comes with marinated grilled chicken thighs, saffron rice and zucchini with a side salad. There was a yogurt sauce which I did not use. Chicken was nicely grilled and charred and rice was good. It was $22 and expected more rice and the side salad was laughable. It was only a few leaves. The chicken was in a good amount but some pieces had cartilage. OK for dinner butLokma seems overpriced to me.,I guess the website does not reflect real operating hours. The website lists 9:30 am on Thursdays, but we were just turned away after driving all the way over and paying for parking. I mentioned to the hostess that the website listed 9:30, but she said we were wrong. So, double check before going for breakfast,Lokma is a neighborhood gem. You will get an authentic taste of Turkish cuisine in a cozy setting (they also have plenty of outsoor parklet seating). The food is simply delicious at reasonable prices with the friendliest staff. I also enjoy their weekend brunch.  5 stars!,Great meal! Enjoyed the burger, a tasty mix of beef, lamb and feta cheese on a soft bun with yummy aioli. And an especially yummy mild ginger beer.,Been walking past this place and it always busy. We visited it and it was a pretty good experience. I don't think I will be returning. Check it out if you like. Service was great and food drink was tasty. Enjoy.,I've had Lokma in my Yelp bookmarks for quite some time now. I finally made my way over to the Richmond District to give it a try and I'm so glad I did!Lokma is a super cute neighborhood spot with great dishes and a welcoming staff. Perfect for a weeknight dinner. My brother and I tried a few appetizers and ordered entrees as well. In my opinion, the appetizers were the star of the show! The Stand Outs:Spreads - Muhammara, Baba Ganoush, and Tzatiki with Pita. Every Turkish meal needs dips - nuff said. All three were great but the Muhammara was definitely my favorite.  Zucchini Dolmas - These were BOMB. I'm not a huge meat-eater but the ground beef inside was seasoned perfectly and was great with the garlic yogurt.Grilled Lamb Kofte - Again, not a huge meat-eater but these were insane. Definitely, my favorite thing we ordered.We also got the Shishito Peppers and Watermelon Salad. The peppers were good but I wouldn't order them again. For entrees, I got the Presidio Salad and tried a bite of the Manti! The Manti was delicious and not too heavy which says a lot considering all the apps we ordered.Would definitely go back to Lokma - looking forward to trying their brunch next!,Lokma has adorable indoor decor and incredible food! Absolutely loved everything I ordered.The Turkish breakfast comes with eggs, sausage, feta, honey, cheese, and more and serves 2. Great way to try a little bit of everything. The Greek yogurt pancakes were not too sweet and perfectly fluffy. Easily one of my favorite brunch spots, but I might be partial because I prefer Turkish breakfast to American breakfast.,Food, service, and ambience 10/10!The trio spread was such a good appetizer, the eggplant hummus & tzatziki were so creamy and light. The PAPAS BRAVAS ARE A MUST HERE - fried potatoes with a creamy feta topping! The eggplant was surprisingly so delightful! But the MANTI (dumplings) were a FAVORITE here. I've never had any dish like this before! Loved the cozy and lovely ambiance -- they gave us blankets & had a heater outside so it was toasty and warm while enjoying our food.,Outside seating is open during covid. L to R: Athonia,denise & Tom PozerHealthy Vegan eaters can order the Baba Ganoush or Hummus.  Order yours w/extra pita bread. What's missing? Chili's ‼. I wish they had jalapeño or Serrano peppers to make this Om nom nom chompsky  pop.  They only have Sri Racha hot sauce. Bring your own if that flava won't do,Great brunch spot! The Turkish breakfast for two was a fabulous meal to share over a leisurely visit and exceeded our expectations. The clotted cream honey dish was divine.I would however skip the turkish coffee next time, it was laughably bad. We were served a cup filled with coffee grounds three fourths of the way up and the actual drink lasted three small mouthfuls.Haven't been for dinner yet but interested in trying some of their dinner options. Wait can be long; recommend adding yourself to the Yelp waitlist.,I've been here for brunch and dinner, food has been great for both. The Turkish breakfast spread is a must have. For dinner, we ordered the couscous calamari and it was delicious! Love the tomato based sauce. Recommend making a reservation as it can get crowded.,I've had this spot on my list for a while and ended up coming here around Thursday brunch. Quick seating inside and parking in the area was relatively easy around this time, especially for SF. The service was really great and the food was delicious.Food highlights:- Turkish breakfast for two - comes with eggs, pita, and so many sides- Greek yogurt pancakes - very fluffy and comes with blueberry compote- Turkish coffee,Heard great things from my daughter about this place.  I had some friends from the Sacramento area who wanted  some Mediterranean food after a short walk at Land's End.  This was the first time I tried using the Yelp waitlist feature and I am very impressed.  We signed up for first available table and we were seated as soon as we arrived!The staff were attentive and gracious.  They provided us with blankets when we made a comment that it was somewhat chilly.  We had coffee, one had the Lokma chicken sandwich, another had the Grilled Lamb wrap, and yet another, the Presidio Salad.  Everyone was pleased with their choices.  I was very satisfied with my choice, the Turkish Breakfast, which I also got to share with my friends since it's good for 2.  The pita bread went with everything- the thin slices of air-dried cured beef called Pastirma, there were 4 scrambled eggs with Turkish sausage, slices of feta cheese, an assortnent of olives, fresh orange slices, strawberry and blackberry, grape tomatoes, cucumber, kaymak (clotted cream) & honey and Muhammara or mhammara which is a spicy dip made of walnuts, red bell peppers, pomegranate molasses, and breadcrumbs.  I am definitely coming back!,Delicious food!! Also love the ambiance and decor inside. We are repeat customers! Only complaint is that there is not a lot of seating inside, so many parties get seated outside. Both options can be quite cold at night because they leave the door open for servers to go in/out for the different tables.,We joined the Yelp waitlist and as soon as we arrived we were quickly seated indoors. I love the ambiance: plants on windowsills, a stunning bar, and a crowd following the suggested low volume signage. For a group of 3, we ordered 3 hearty dishes: Turkish Breakfast (2), Turlu Omelette, and Grilled Lamb Meatballs Wrap. Our server recommended Greek Yogurt Pancakes but we are not really pancake people. Everything tasted amazing and I would absolutely recommend this place.,Went here for lunch with a friend for the first time and I was honestly impressed with the quality and taste! We shared the Turkish Breakfast for 2 which was more than enough to fill us up. I loved the freedom to top my pita bread with a variety of small delicacies. - especially the kaymak & honey! It was a perfect blend of creamy yet mildly sweet. We also decided to order a side of the Greek yogurt pancakes since everyone was raving about it and it was one of the best pancakes I've had! Fluffy, tarty, and sweet - a harmonious trio. I would definitely come back again to try their dinner menu!,I have never had a Turkish breakfast and Lokma set the bar very high for me. A mix of perfectly selected and crafted ingredients that make you not feel like a true health nut(pun intended. A must if you're visiting from out-of-town, an experience like this is hard to come by. The best part is that the food will actually energize you vs. make you feel groggy and will allow for further exploring in the city.,I've been to Lokma twice now, once for indoor dining and once for outdoor dining. The interior is beautiful and homey, and they did a great job with outdoor dining. It gets chilly in the Richmond but there were heat lamps keeping us warm. It also had plenty of space between the tables and the sidewalk. The food here is excellent! My favorites are the branzino, trio spreads, and manti. I think it can be intimidating to eat the branzino because it is the whole fish, but totally worth it. I recommend making a reservation ahead of time!,My new favorite breakfast spot. Didn't wait long on a Saturday morning. The Turkish sausage was divine. The star of the show is definitely the Greek yogurt pancakes. Oh man, those are amazing. Excellent service and pleasant staff.,I had a late lunch here on the last day of my Sf trip and I wish I had come earlier.The food was AMAZING, people were super sweet and the atmosphere was relaxing. I dug in right away when the food arrived, so no photos but we ordered bal&kaymak to start with which comes with warm pita  and then we also ordered Manti, Calamari and Papas Bravas to share. Calamari was outstanding. Manti is also one of my favorites. I would try their whole menu if I could hahaDefinitely coming back here next time. Such a special place,Went here for a birthday for a party 12 (with pre-set menu). We were seated outside so can't say much about the ambiance, but they had appropriate heaters/cover and also plenty of street parking. The food was pretty amazing at a pretty decent price. Good portions, very flavorful and also beautifully presented and the service was pretty nice (note they're also Halal!) My favorite were the Manti (super cute) Papas Baravas (not pictured) and the grilled chicken.  I personally didn't like the baklava, as I thought it was a little on the dense side.,If your looking for an authentic Turkish food this is the place . I tired the Turkish breakfast for 2 which was my way to explore their cuisine . Everything that was served as part of the platter was good and something I love . Mostly their Belfast has very little cooked items versus just putting together items in a display of the platter . The main protein is egg scramble (little gooey) with sausage . It comes with different accompaniments like olives , feta cheese, tomatoes with cucumber , sautéed potatoes (crispy), soft cheese with honey, hummus and blackberry . It's a good portion for 2 people and works really good as brunch .The simit (Turkish bagel) is a must try as well , served with crumbled feta cheese . Also the TURKISH coffee , for some reason it put me to sleep not sure why Things I was highly disappointed were food takes longer to be ready at the table and relying on the waitlist is a waste of time as I was on 16th positions for 2 hours never updated . ADVISE: Show up to the restaurant and they are welcoming to accommodate you a table fairly quick .,Excellent meal and service. It was a rather cold night snd the doors were kept open for good circulation. All of the dishes were specially prepared, presented, snd delicious.,Everything was perfect. First time eating here for our party of 6 and it was fantastic. Everyone enjoyed their meal. We were sat outdoors on the parklet on a beautiful day - so already off to a great start. Food: We began with coffee, a lemonade (perfect level of tart & sweet), a mimosa and 2 pom Bellinis. We shared the Warm Mediterranean Olives and the Trio Spreads which was a crowd pleaser. My friend had the Creamy Mushroom Soup which was so rich and delicious. Another friend had the Turkish breakfast. We all shared the pancakes which had the best berry compote on top and two other friends had the omelet which was so fluffy I couldn't believe it. Everything was reasonably priced, and the portions were perfect. Waitlist: we used the Yelp waitlist to help us skip the line. Best decision, would recommend Service: water was given quickly, orders were brought out promptly, everyone was kind and friendly and helpful with all of our questions. We didn't feel rushed at all even though it was a Sunday at brunch to time! Will definitely be back :),The food was fresh and wonderful taste combinations.  Three of us picked several small plates which we shared.  We are ins,Parking may be a bit tough during peak times.Restaurant is located on the corner.Lots of parklets, outdoor seating, indoor seating.---I really like places that have Yelp wait list. I was able to put myself on the list as we were getting there, since it was starting to get busier. By the time we found parking, we got to the front and was able to get seated right away inside.The indoor area is very cute, nice ambiance.We got the Turkish breakfast, 2 sunrise combos (greek yogurt pancakes and scrambled eggs), and the omelet (ratatouille!). Favorite part of the Turkish breakfast was the honey+butter. Omgoodness, if the human body could consume as much cholesterol and sugar as I wanted, I would have asked for more and more. Alas, I ate two pita breads worth and enjoyed every bite. The scrambled eggs with the sausage pieces was okay -- it was a bit piecey and not as fluffy as I would like, but still pretty good.Make sure you eat the pancakes as soon as they come out -- having the greek yogurt melt into the warm fluff is heavenly.Don't forget to get a Turkish coffee! You can adjust the sweetness.,Always very happy when we stroll into this little neighborhood joint and enjoy some shishito peppers and a glass of red. Everything on the menu is a dream and the staff takes extra good care of you. A great place to introduce people to flavorful Turkish dishes. Tonight I was overjoyed seeing they had items listed out on their menu as gluten-free.  This is a new struggle for me and not having to try pick through each item of a dish before ordering was so very helpful and much appreciated.,Since having amazing manti in Istanbul,  I've been on the hunt for great manti in the US. This was not it. The manti in Istanbul was shaped like ravioli and the yogurt sauce was amazing. The version here are really small, with hardly any meatand almost no sauce. How do you serve manti with almost no sauce? The meat to pasta ratio was off and the meat was chewy, probably from being overcooked. The Karniyarik came highly recommended and looked delicious,, but the eggplant was thin and dry and the meat was not well seasoned. The rice also had an odd taste. It would have been better if there was just white rice. Overall I was sadly disappointed.,Very nice food, fresh and fast. The staff was very helpful and the outdoor dining area is just perfect.,Loved up to the hype forsure! Came on a busy Sunday, but joined the Yelp waitlist (they don't take reservations) and got seated on time. Ordered: Turkish breakfast for 2 and the Greek yogurt pancakes. Both were incredible. Pancakes weren't too sweet and the Turkish breakfast for 2 was filling. Texted my friends immediately to come eat here!!!,Visited Lokma for the first time this morning for breakfast and had an amazing experience. We arrived at 9:30 when they open and we're seated immediately. The servers were all helpful and pleasant checking in continuously. The decor and serving plates definitely fit the expectation for a Mediterranean restaurant! We will be returning with reservations to try their dinner menu!,This would be one of my favorite places for brunch if I lived in SF. My omelette was very good. The potatoes too, which is surprising because I feel like at many other brunch places the potatoes are kind of like a dead filler that we don't actually want. I also tried a bite of their chicken sandwich and you can actually taste the grill. Absolutely wonderful, and would love to come back here again.,Lokma came up in my search results, their menu looked interesting, so we decided to give it a try. I was able to get on their waitlist through Yelp. Finding parking can be hard especially for weekends, but we got lucky and were able to park on the same street.Thee server seated us within 5 mins of our arrival. They have limited indoor and pretty nice outdoor seating (some tables covered and some uncovered). We ordered a trio which comes with tomato hummus, tzatziki, babaganush and pita, side of greek yogurt pancakea, Bak Kaymak (clotted cream and honey with pita bread). I only had the hummus and babaganoush, both vegan with pita and it was delicious. The other items were great too from what I heard.Good choices for vegetarians, some good options for vegans. Great and quick service, delicious and interesting food, we'll be back to try their other menu items! Give it a try!,Husband, kiddo, and I visited this cute neighborhood gem for dinner on a Friday night. Super chic yet laid back vibe indoors, lots of very inviting-looking tables with heat lamps for outdoor dining. We ordered everything to share, 'cause sharing is caring and that's how we roll in this family: The trio of spreads (Muhammara, Baba Ganoush, Tzatziki) served with warm pillowy pita bread, zucchini dolmas, braised short ribs, Manti dumplings, and the halibut. So delicious! We almost finished every last bite of food!Great wine list and lots of great options by the glass. We especially loved the Atma Assyrtiko from Greece, which had a lovely salinity and minerality that paired so well with the halibut. The Okuzgozu from Turkey was a balanced red that was delicious with the short rib. Thanks for introducing us to these wines!Great service!  Staff were all so lovely, warm, and efficient, and wearing masks (this act of caring and courtesy is well-appreciated by our family. Especially me, as a critical care nurse.). Brilliant and well done, Lokma!  Thank you for a wonderful dinner and evening out!,"The stars are because the staff is nice.The food is very basic and not Turkish at all.The """"Turkish breakfast"""" is similar to a type of Turkish breakfast (olive", cucumber, feta..)  but honestly the hummus/tomatoe is not Turkish at all; could at least be  muhammara .. and the portions are so small!!! For TWO people?! One person can easily eat this... the yogurt however with honey was lovely. The potato side was ok! Glad i added it.The wait: we were told 20 min.. it ended up being 40 min.. there were empty tables so ut made no sense to me.. i am guessing that its because the kitchen could not keep up since during covid outside space doubled but now inside is open again  but still its a little off putting to see empty tables and not to be sat down.  Bathrooms were clean. Green napkins were a lovely color!,Made a reservation for three at this place the night before. Overall great experience with great service!Orders:- Zucchini Dolmas: originally disappointed at getting 2 dolmas instead of 3 from some photos we saw on Yelp. The zucchini on the outside was so soft and melts in your mouth. The inside was a little bit too tangy for me (assuming from tomato) but my friends really liked it!- Papas Bravas: yummy. Fried potatoes in sauce. Such a good flavor and this is surprisingly my favorite dish!- Pita with Trio Spread: generous cute portion of pita bread, and really enjoyed the three different types of spreads! Great appetizer.- Lamb Loin Chops: 4 lamb chops on top of an eggplant purée. Delicious though I thought it can use a tiny bit more salt.Really enjoyed the food and experience here. Would try to stop by if I'm in the area again.,Even after valid reservation, the table provided was on the footpath by the roadside. They denied to provide a better table.,I really appreciate the beautiful presentation and thoughtfulness of the food here! I don't eat this cuisine often, and was pleased when I received a meal that was fresh, interesting, and balanced. Came here on a weeknight around 6pm and it wasn't too crowded. It was nice to people watch outside. I got the eggplant dish and turkish coffee for my drink (note that it's espresso sized!) and it was a pleasant experience overall.,The three of us had dinner here after a long day of adventure in SF. We drove by this quaint little spot on the corner of 19th and 20th,  so we decided to dine at this Turkish restaurant.  We sat outside and fortunately there were heaters to warm us up. We shared the Bal & Kaymak, which is a fluffy house-made pita that comes with honey & clotted cream spread.  What a great starter! I got excited about what was to come. Since the appetizer was delish, I couldn't help but have high expectations!We also shared the Lamb Loin Chops which were perfectly cooked and seasoned. It was really tasty too because the lamb was glazed with sweet pomegranate. The lamb chops were on top of something pureed. I thought it was similar to mashed potatoes, but it had more oomph. I looked on the menu online and it's actually Aubergine Purée was a surprise because, first of all, I didn't know what the heck aubergine was. But when I learned it was eggplant, I was like, wtf...  eggplant???? It was really good! I knew it was more than mashed potatoes. It was way better! I only had a little bit of the Lokma Burger, but that little bit made me a fan! The combo of beef and lamb proved that the cooks in the kitchen know what they're doing! Another meat that was perfectly cooked. It had feta and veggies to make it even more delicious! For dessert, we shared the Flan. It was interesting to compare it to my mom's Filipino Flan and Mexican Flan. My mom's flan is the best of the three (I hope she reads this so I can earn brownie points), but they are all unique in their own way. They just call it Flan on the menu, so I'm not sure if it's actually Turkish. I mean, they're all similar - creamy and sweet. I love how the Turkish Flan has hazelnuts on top," which is a delightful addition.Excellent food! Phenomenal service! I found out from their website that """"lokma"""" means """"a bite"""". And I realized how it took only one bite of each dish to make each one unforgettable.",Really delicious brunch spot! Loved the blueberry greek yogurt spread on the pancakes. The sausage was very flavorful and eggs were very fluffy,We stopped by here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon after boating at Stow Lake. Their Breakfast and Lunch menu is limited compared to dinner menu and also they were not able to seat us inside even at 2 pm even though it was really cold & windy outside for our kids. With that said, these were the only two reason why I rated this 4 instead of 5. The food here is just amazing and also the hostess was kind enough to get some blankets for us to keep us all warm. We got the lamb wraps and they were really tasty, fresh and just perfect. We have not had better lamb wraps before. Also, the hot potatoes and yogurt dip in the wrap plate were also very good. We also got their Presidio salad with grilled chicken and it was amazing. The chicken sandwich, flan, turkish tea and coffee were decent. Overall we enjoyed our dining experience here.,Decided to give Lokma a try this afternoon for Friday lunch, having seen all the great reviews about it. It does not disappoint.Had mushroom soup for a starter, which was flavorful and tasty.Followed up with a Lokma burger and beef bacon. Everything about it was delicious. Perfectly cooked home fries and crispy burger bun. Beef was just nice - medium rare as I like it, and the beef bacon is delicious - a pleasant surprise and nice alternative to classic pork bacon.Looking forward to visiting again in the future.,I LOVED lokma. We called the restaurant after our Lands End hike to see if they could accommodate us and they could!! We had a large party of 10. My only complaint was that they could only seat us outside without heaters so we were pretty cold. The veggie pita was yummy, but the killer dish was the Greek yogurt pancake. I need to come back just to get them!,Came here for breakfast and was not disappointed. Definitely recommend making a reservation beforehand because they are super busy! Food was authentic and the service was quick and friendly.,Burger - outstanding.  The full combo of meat and picked onions and sauce.  I used to make burgers competitively.  You guys nailed this one.  Turkish Breakfast - Never, never again.  Every aspect was a big disappointment.  Bacon is just bad beef jerky  served cold.  Olives were so salty that I wiped them down with a napkin before consuming.,I'd been to Lokma for dinner before, and while J thought the food was good, I don't remember much about it. A recent brunch trip was well worth the time though. My friend and I got the sunrise combo and the breakfast sandwich and swapped half our food so we could both try a little bit of everything. Everything was tasty with the memorable highlights being the very tender scrambled eggs with the sujuk (beef sausage) and the crispy potatoes. Just very tasty food that's not trying to look pretty just for Instagram points.,In the search for a good Saturday brunch, I ended up here and I'm so glad I did!It was super busy on Saturday, but we got lucky being seated at a table right away inside. I already knew I wanted to try the greek yogurt pancakes after hearing great things about and we got a side of Baba Ganoush with pita.The food came out not too long after and those pancakes were amazing! The tangy from the yogurt pairs really well with the pancakes and the pancakes were fluffy. The blueberry compote comes through and enhances the taste! The Baba Ganoush was great as well.I'll definitely be back here again either for brunch or next time for dinner!,I came here for brunch and it was exceptional! Every ingredient they used were so fresh and it was top notch quality! I had their Turkish coffee which was very dark and delicious! They use the beans from Andytown and poured it in a little cup. I ordered the sunrise combo which came with fluffy pancakes topped with fresh blueberry jam and Greek yogurt. It was so delicious! Also had a side of sausage and eggs. It was the perfect sweet and savory combo. I tried my bf's chicken sandwich and the potatoes too and they were also really good! The restaurant was quiet and has outdoor seating as well. I cannot wait to come back to try their dinner!,Been a regular here and always loved the food, but my latest experience here was just terrible. Awfully rude server. She couldn't split the bill for us and was horribly unhelpful with follow up questions re the splitting.She confused us so much and wanted us to pay up as fast as possible--when we accidentally skipped past the tip section, she yelled at us and ordered us to tell her what was wrong with the service. I've never ever been treated this way, so odd. She then walked over to the really nice guy who served us and told him we didn't pay. We were obviously on our way to him to give him a physical tip since we skipped past the electronic tips thanks to the confusion the female server created.We eventually thanked him for his great service and handed him the tip. I'm not sure I want to visit again.,Came to Lokma for my birthday celebration dinner and had an amazingly delicious meal and received great service. I hardly took some photos before the family devoured everything. The lamb with eggplant purée and pomegranate sauce is a must try. Levrek (Branzino) tasted very good too. The appetizer lamb meatballs, shishito peppers with yogurt sauce, the calamari with couscous all very unique with different spices and delighted our tastebuds. And the baklava. Oh the baklava. Not too sweet, rich with pistachios, melted in our mouths. Highly recommend this place for anyone visiting San Francisco. I am coming back to try the manti dish asap.,Fantastic place, delicious food, and extremely kind and sweet service. As soon we heard that there was a place in the city that served Turkish breakfast, we decided to go right away. We got there by 11 AM, and there was plenty of parking on the street. We chose to eat indoors since it was not crowded, and we were in the middle of breakfast and lunch, so this was the perfect time to enjoy food and chat with the restaurant crew. As I mentioned, everyone was wearing a pleasant and welcome smile. They gave us the menu and asked us for a coffee and drinks. I love fresh-squeezed orange juice with my breakfast. My other friends ordered coffee, and then we all agreed to order Turkish breakfast. Turkish Breakfast For 2," and I was so excited to have Turkish breakfast after long time. It's very close to the real deal except pita bread but we ordered Simits too. One thing like to mention it's the ambiance of this place which is very casual but very comfortable and that credit goes to wonderful hosts who were so kind and understanding. Please try this place and we are planning to go back during holidays. Highly recommended""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Purple Rice,"Their soondubu is so flavorful, I can't wait to have it again!By default you can get a veggie soft tofu stew for $14, then add kimchi, beef, seafood, etc. for $3 more. They have 5 spice levels for the soup and you can choose between white or purple rice.I wasn't super hungry so I decided to just go with the veggie soft tofu stew with no add-ons. The stew came with a generous portion of tofu and also included an egg! The servers brought out 5 different side dishes while we waited for our orders.For a soft tofu stew with only vegetables, I found the broth to be packed with umami. I could drink the broth all day! Combined with the various veggies, tofu, and chewy purple rice, the stew was a filling and satisfying meal.The servers were very friendly and helpful which made for an overall positive experience. I look forward to trying other items on their menu.,Poor service, ordered food without onion and it came with it. Even says so on the receipt. Called back because I can't eat this and they asked if it was listed on the receipt. Yes.... I said it a few times, you heard it and put it on the receipt  Then, they proceed to put me on hold next to the counter where I could hear every sound from customer to cashier operator sounds. I stayed on for 5 minutes then just hung up, ridiculous.Portion size is small for the price, look at the rice cake ratio. Extraordinarily disappointing in every way, won't come here again :/,Such a great neighborhood Korean restaurant! I haven't had a such a fine and delicious soon doo boo ""Korean soft tofu soup"" in a long time.Last time was in Annandale in Virginia.The banchans were pretty good, bean sprouts, pickled radish, seaweed, kimchi, and pickled kale.It was a very delicious and comforting meal for me.I love the ambiance of this little neighborhood restaurant, low light and airy.This place for me is great food, great price and great value.Will come here very often.,Highly recommend their grill beef short ribs! The beef is well marinated and super tender. The dumplings and chicken wings are delicious, great appetizer for sharing. The only thing is that the side dishes can be improved... It's probably one of my least favorite Korean side dishes I've encountered. Most of them lack of flavor even the kimchi. And the portions are very little. The restaurant is spacious and clean. And the staff is friendly. There's a waiting list when it gets busy so make sure you put your name on the list when you arrive.,Living in San Francisco, Korean food has always been on the pricier side but when I stumbled upon Purple Rice, I was shocked with how reasonably priced it was. My boyfriend and I came an hour before closing and it honestly felt rush since they do want diners to be finished eating and paying around the time the restaurant closes. It was overwhelming but one of the male servers was kind and made sure we had refills on our tea and water. Korean Noodle soup (4/5) - It honestly just tasted like they made Shin Ramen and added an egg to it but you can never go wrong with Shin Ramen.Fried Chicken (5/5) - flawlessly fried where the skin was crispy yet the meat was moist. This is a must get here.Galbi (5/5) - The meat was tender and well marinated. The way the meat effortlessly came off the bone showed how succulent the meat was. A great spot for an inexpensive bite of Korean food. I will definitely be back.,Purple Rice is one of my go-to spots in Lower Haight for a Korean meal! My favorites are the veggie soft tofu stew and the bibimbap, which are the best value items on the menu in my opinion. The seafood pancake is also delicious! I've ordered a few of the dishes with meat, and while they were tasty, it wasn't as good value. The interior is pretty basic, and there are several tables inside. I've come here with larger groups, and they've always been really accommodating in seating us quickly. Even during busy times, I've never had to wait more than a few minutes. The staff here has always been really friendly, and the food is always served quickly. There's not a lot of Korean food in Lower Haight, so I'm really glad we have Purple Rice!,I had dinner here with a group of friends and got to try a couple of dishes. At 7:30pm on a weekday, there was a short wait of ~5-10min. Overall, this is a solid spot for Korean food in the Lower Haight area. However, I'm docking off a point because the staff taking our order messed up on an item, and the dishes here weren't as spicy as they should be. For starters, I tried the sweet & tangy chili chicken wings and vegetable dumplings. The chicken wings (7 per order) were tasty and portions ended up being bigger than expected. For the dumplings, we ordered fried vegetable dumplings but instead received steamed dumplings with pork, which was unfortunate because one person in my group cannot eat pork. This either was a complete mix up, or the menu should state this dish isn't vegetarian. I ordered the veggie soft tofu stew with beef, medium spice, and a side of purple rice. This was delicious and satisfied my craving for tofu stew! However, I did wish the stew was spicier and less salty. Even though I asked for medium level spice, I barley tasted the spice. Next time, I'll know to bump up the spice level.I also tried some of my friends' beef short ribs and side dishes, which were well seasoned and delicious. I recommend visiting this spot in a group so you can try out a variety of dishes.,Great Korean place in a neat area! Came here with a group of 7 around 6 pm on a Saturday and we were able to be seated without any wait! The portion sizes of everything we ordered were pretty big and we got sides of kimchi, bean sprouts, cabbage, and a few other things with each dish. I ordered the Veggie Soft Tofu Stew with purple rice (of course) and it was pretty good! Felt like a great hot meal on a cold, gloomy day! My friends ordered the Veggie Jhap Chae, Thinly Sliced Beef, and the Iron Works. Overall good reviews for them all! I'd come back to try the Veggie Jhap Chae and Iron Works (portion sizes looked massive for these and smelled great),As a gal who loves korean food, dare I say it is in my monthly rotation of eating out at least twice a month (which is generous considering the plethora of options). This place is pretty good! 4.5 stars! Their fried chicken is the star of the show I think. Crispy delicate batter with super moist chicken. Their spicy beef soup is very comforting and gotta pair it with purple rice. Its in the name people! You doing it wrong if you get white rice. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the bonchon game is below average. Its not one of the better bonchon I've tried because of the options, portion, and flavor. Lets be real, half of korean food is the bonchon! (I kid, I kid).,Decided to give this place a try in person since I really liked it when I doordashed it a few weeks ago. I really love the ambiance, it was cozy and the tables weren't packed. Wonderful service and the food arrived fairly quickly after ordering. I am so impressed by the flavors of all the dishes here, it definitely satisfied my cravings! The portions are on the smaller side but you won't be uncomfortably stuffed afterwards. My group still had room for dessert. Seafood pancake: I would pass on this, although it was delicious, it was $12 and I can't justify the price with the portion they servedChicken wings: I'm still thinking about how crispy these were. You can't go wrong with soy garlic sauce and the batter was so light and crispy! Dolsot bibimbap: I didn't order this but when I got it for takeout last time I enjoyed it a lot. The bowl was very balanced and it comes with a bowl of soup if you eat in person. Beef and seafood tofu soup: This was just what I needed after a long day, it was so comforting! They have different spice levels when ordering. I usually get medium but wasn't spicy at all for me.,A solid Korean spot that that does most things well but there isn't anything particularly special or distinctive about it. From Bibimbap and K-BBQ dishes to japchae and buchimgae, you can get your standard Korean dishes that will for the most part be tasty, though consistency hasn't always been there. Again, it's good but not great. Similarly, the banchan (side dishes) used to be better and they definitely used to be more generous. The portion sizes seem smaller and the prices seem to be going up, too. Service has been a hit and miss over time, as well. And the ambience is just ok. If you are picking up, their estimated time is always off and I do mean always. If you are in a pinch you'll get a good meal, just probably not a great one. There are better Korean options in the city thought they would require you to go further. Also I'm just not a fan of some of the cost cutting techniques lately so I can't really give them more than 4 stars even if I often find myself settling to get food here due to its convenience.,I wouldn't say this place is super traditional style korean food, it's a little bit more americanized modern. I think the portion sizes are pretty decent for the price, especially the rice cake soup ($14)! The side dishes are quite unique; I liked the seaweed and kale salads. We came at 6pm and it was emptier, but by 8 it got packed and had a wait!,My friends wanted to take me out for dinner on my birthday. I had initially picked a different Korean restaurant, but wanted to make things easier, but picking a different place nearby. We were seated immediately at 6:30PM on a Sunday.So taste-wise, the food was fine. I'm glad that we had some banchan to munch on. But portion-wise, we were not happy with this. I guess I didn't do my due diligence and look through the Yelp photos of the food portions. When I looked at the menu, I thought that the prices for each dish seemed reasonable. But that's when I realized how we got ripped off! We order 4 items to share between 4 people.-Seafood pancake - $12 for FOUR small pieces of a pancake. Seafood pancakes normally go for about ~$18 and you get a WHOLE plate of the pancake. Major rip off!-Sizzling works bibimbap with spicy seafood with purple rice - $23 for the spicy seafood option. This has got to be the SMALLEST dolsot bibimbap that I have ever had! And the bibimbap was MOSTLY filled with veggies. There was barely enough purple rice. I can pay $26 for an even LARGER dolsot bibimbap. Also, the dolsot didn't even burn the rice, so there was no crunchy texture to the rice. This was a major disappointment.-Mini beef short ribs - $23 for a plate of 6 PIECES of short ribs. I can pay $28+ for an LARGER portion of short ribs. Also another major rip off.-Veggie japchae - $15. Of the 4 items that we ordered, this dish might've been the most reasonable price, BUT still a major rip off. I can pay $18 for a japchae with some protein and more noodles.I should've stuck with my initial restaurant suggestion. We barely ordered enough food for everyone to be satisfied. So we ended up getting boba to fill up our stomachs. I'm never coming back here again. NOTE: DO NOT COME HERE FOR KOREAN FOOD. IT IS OVERPRICED AND THE PORTION SIZES ARE WAYYYYYY SMALLER THAN REGULAR KOREAN RESTAURANTS. YOU WILL END UP SPENDING WAY MORE MONEY IF YOU WANT A FILLING MEAL.,For a Korean place, in San Francisco, Purple Rice is very good. The restaurant is clean and service is good. The food was tasty, but not the Korean vibe you can get in southern California.  I would come back if in the area again, but wouldn't go out of my way.Both green iced tea and black iced tea are offered with free refills.  They had the usual Korean alcohol drinks.The ban chan side dishes were all tasty, but portions were very small, barely enough for one person. Maybe a third of what you might get at other Korean restaurants.  You could probably ask for more, or they could have offered, but they didn't.  There was a kale ban chan, which we thought was weird, but it was tasty. My wife didn't try the kale.My wife had the tofu soup and I had the spicy beef soup. I had a conversation with the waiter about the fiery chicken dish and decided against it after he said how spicy it was.  I was going to have the beef soup medium spicy, but the waiter said that medium wasn't spicy enough for him, so I ordered full spicy.  I liked it. I might go for the fiery chicken next time. The beef soup could of had just a little more bean noodles though. Although the beef soup came in big bowl, the size you could get in a pho restaurant, it wasn't as filling.  I would order an appetizer next time,This place does really tasty and spicy food, and is great for groups. Can't remember all the different names of the things we got but everything was really good, so you can't go wrong. The spicy honey chicken wings were especially flavorful and crispy.,We came for Sunday lunch. They are not super busy but the service is a bit slow. The ambiance is modern like a fast food place. We ordered shot ribs (large), chicken wings and bibimbap. Except the wings, everything  comes in a smaller portion than what we expected. Food taste delicious but the portion is small for the price. Their side dishes are tiny as well. We know several other Korean restaurants that offer same delicious food for the same price in a larger portion. Considering how competitive things are, we probably won't be back again.,A surprise find! Was craving something warm and comforting for dinner and found this spot. Barely a wait since we got there early! They had a wide variety of Korean rice dishes and barbecue. I got the soft tofu stew and added fish cakes for $3 extra and it was WORTH IT. The stew was so warm and spicy and the tofu was soft!! There was also a poached egg in there was yummy! Also it was served with purple rice was was filling and hearty. We also tried the sizzling rice bowl with chicken which was delicious and the veggie tasted distinct and wonderful. All our meals came with banchan (side dishes) and we really enjoyed sharing those (my favorite was the pickled radishes).Service was good too but we just felt very hurried out even though the restaurant was not busy while we were there and there was no queue waiting. It just felt a little odd since we got the bill right after we got our food and felt like we needed to finish up quick. Otherwise a wonderful place for quality tasty Korean food!,i'm korean-american and originally from LA, so i can be picky about my bibimbap, but the food at purple rice was GREAT! there were so many different components and veggies (i was pleasantly surprised by the purple cabbage) a generous serving of beef, perfectly fried egg, and i always love how my food stays hot thanks to the hot stone bowl. the banchan side dishes were tasty and they even give you miso soup :) only thing i would say is i think they could leave the stone bowl on the heat a little longer because it could have been a little crispier at the bottom. for the price, the portions were super generous and i was absolutely stuffed when i left. bill came out to less than $20! service was also great and the restaurant wasn't too busy on saturday noon-ish so no waits. i will definitely come again when i'm craving bibimbap.,A new and hot Korean restaurant that I love.I'd not recommend its rice cake soup, BUT everything else (especially the fried chicken wings & spicy noodles) were 10/10. Would love to come back again!,Got the Korean noodles this time around and OH BABY i might like it can more than the soondubu??? the noodles were such a great texture (very QQ) and the broth was nice and rich. definitely would get this again!,Having to sit in the hospital is no fun...however the ease of ordering food, delivery and taste was all very comforting during a difficult time. Food was delicious and came in a prompt manner. Plenty of food in the Bibimbap Bowl and the vegetables were tasty. The banchan was somewhat light in amount given, we would have liked a bigger serving. We ordered 2 Bibimbap one chicken and the other spicy pork. All very tasty and would love to try it again in the actual restaurant.The delivery person was courteous, friendly and waited to hand me the food directly.,Decent Korean food for a fair price and a good quick spot in Hayes Valley! We came here on a Friday night a bit close to close - would recommend coming earlier though since they ran out of all the BBQ options.Ordered the dolsot w/sliced beef and the tofu stew; tofu stew was delicious!! Broth was the perfect level of spicy and dolsot was surprisingly filling. Highly recommend for some quick, easy Korean food.,my friends and i came here for dinner on a friday, pretty decently sized space and had a good amount of tables. It was a bit of a wait, maybe 20-25 minutes, but once we were in, the food came relatively quickly! We ordered a seafood pancake to share, although it was a bit small and pricey, it was very yummy! My friend and i each got the tofu soup, medium spicy. it looked very spicy, but wasn't too bad when we ate. My only reason for docking a star was that there were limited banchan, but the food was overall very yummy.,Great find on Haight in Hayes Valley! Perfect for both individual portions or to share! Food was so fresh and PIPING HOT!We ordered the kimchi stew and the kimchi iron works. The Kimchi Iron Works was definitely the star of the show! I would come back specifically for this dish!!,I've been here twice now ever since moving to SF. I haven't had much good Korean restaurants in SF, but this place definitely fulfills my Korean food cravings! Bibimbap: you get the choose which meat to add with EXTRA COST! I was confused from the menu because it said ""choose meat / extra meat"" (something along those lines) but if I knew, I probably wouldn't have gotten it since it was $7 extra. Nonetheless, it was really good (worth without the meat)! Tofu soup: we've tried Han Il Kwan's tofu soup before and thought this was better! More flavorful.Overall, the location is nice and service was awesome! The servers were very attentive and nice.,Worse Korean food. We ordered here due to the high rating. Now I'm puzzled and don't understand why?? The restaurant is overpriced, chicken and rice were super dry and hard, seafood beef tofu and Kimchee fried rice were such disappointment. The kids meal was ridiculous $12 for basically rice, 1 Dino nugget, 2 over fried small potstickers, a spoon of shredded little dry chicken. The ""big"" chicken grill should have been called mini because of how small it was for $27. It was dry, overcooked like jerky and must have put 1 and half thigh for $27??? I'm baffled.,Food is good but portions are small ($26 for six small kalbi pieces) and they will not give you additional kimchi until you first finish the tiny amount you get with the banchan. Frustrating to have to repeatedly ask for more banchan to get what would otherwise be a standard portion at any other Korean restaurant. Overall, tasty food but a challenge to find value in the small portions given the price point.,An authentic Korean spot that absolutely be added to your go to spots!Customer service: 5/5. Servers were attentive and friendly, and you can tell the owner really cares about its customers. She ran after after my friend who almost forgot her leftovers to give it to her!Food: Authentic Korean food that hits the spot for native Koreans. Bbibimbap (5/5) certainly didn't skimp out on any of the toppings (nutritional powerhouse). There's also a ton of gluten free & vegetarian & vegan options, making it accessible to everyone. My friend loved the soondubu (5/5) (Not pictured) and we shared a side of the tteokbokki (3/5)- a little too soft for my taste but with lovely flavors.Definitely would come again!,This honestly should be $$$ restaurant for the cost to size ratio. Ordered take out for the first time and portions are horrendously small.The mini size of galbi comes with 6 pieces for $27 roughly?!? And it comes with a huge bowl of rice. The side ""dishes"" is as much as two galbi pieces. The seafood pancake is the size of my palm for $12. This is before tax. Absolute joke. Food is good but not for the price. Any other place is equally good for more food to fill your tummy. Other places are at least double or triple the portion for the price! GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.,Purple rice is one of my favorite restaurants in the city! There are many vegetarian friendly options and everything has amazing flavors. Also, the dishes are accompanied with great traditional side dishes and I just can wait to come back!,Purple Rice was a great find for me when I was craving Korean food in the middle of the city. I had the pleasure of getting their spicy beef soup as well as their sizzling works bibimbap. The spicy beef soup was extremely flavorful and perfectly spicy, however I do think that the serving of noodles that came with it was pretty light. The bibimbap was great as well with the piping hot stone pot and crispy rice. Would recommend if you're looking for Korean near Hayes!,I've been looking for a good soondubu spot in San Francisco and I think I found it!! It was pretty affordable at $14 (but not including any extra toppings or meat options). I chose Spice level 5 (the highest) and it definitely had a kick where I was sweating, but it did not overwhelm me! There was a lot of tofu and vegetables, and it was all super filling and perfect for a rainy day meal.Service was also really great and they were really helpful in answering any questions. They were also really speedy with refilling all the banchan (the small Korean side dishes). A great experience, can't wait to come back and try other dishes here,An excellent Korean restaurant close to Hayes Valley. Early on a Friday evening our party of 2 was seated right away and the restaurant began filling up even more as the evening went on. They have a lot of great vegetarian options which I was happy to see. I ended up trying their Kimchi Pancakes and Dolsot Bibimbap with Fried Tofu. The pancakes were on the greasier side, but had nice flavor. They sort of reminded me of a hash brown. The Dolsot Bibimbap was excellent and stayed piping hot through the whole meal. I order purple rice with mine and it was very good. The toppings were fresh and generous, and the flavor was great. The side dishes they provided were also fantastic and tasted very yummy. Their dishes were on the pricier end, but comparable with other Korean restaurants in the city. I highly recommend checking them out.,Absolutely thrilled to give this place 5 stars. I don't normally like Korean food, but this place is SO good!! My husband lived in Korea for two years and says this is the best Korean food in all of SF. I loved the thinly sliced BBQ beef and my husband liked his Korean Miso Stew. The staff were very friendly and helpful with the menu as well as bringing out more sides as we went through them. I loved the metal cups too - so smooth on the mouth! I would totally come back here and I know my husband is already planning with a group to revisit this place. Purple rice all the way!,The spicy beef soup warmed my body and soul. The spice level (I got mild) was just right and the taste was rich but not overpowering. There was a good portion of noodles and meat, and the rice and side dishes that came with the soup were tasty as well. All in all, would recommend!,Highly recommended for vegetarians food options! Tried tofu stew for the first time and loved it :) The staff was a bit rude but that's okay.,Came here for the 1st time and was great. We walked right in and got seated. We ordered the chili chicken wings, veggie japchae, dolsot bibimbap with bulgogi, and veggie mandoo. Everything was really delicious. The wings were fried more with a tempura batter which I liked and felt lighter. They were nice and crispy and enjoyed the sauce. The japchae was well balanced and liked all the veggies in it. The noodles were good texture and not too sweet. The veggie mandoo was good but next time I'd try it with beef or a protein so it's more flavorful. The bibimbap was great and had a good variety of veggies and the bulgogi was tasty. Food came out pretty quick and was the perfect amount for 2 of us,Purple Rice Ratings: 4/5Food: 4.25/5 - This is my second time here, and I always get the sizzling works bibimbop rice bowl. I got the thinly slice beef with purple rice. This dish is perfect for a chilly night and relatively a healthy meal to eat. The toppings were high quality, added a lot of flavors, and the scorched rice texture on the bottom of the pot is delicious. I really enjoyed it. I would recommend adding the sauce on the side if you like your rice bowls to be a bit sweet and spicy. The broth that comes with it was great, a bit bland but helps balance out the rice bowl. We got the seafood pancakes (no pics here) and it was tasty, but I do not think it was worth the price for a such a small portion and few pieces of seafood pieces. The free banchan side dishes were good. I love the seaweed and the kimchi, very fresh and amazing, but once again the portions are small. Ambiance: 4/5 - This place is pretty small with only like 6 tables total, so there's usually a small wait on the weekends. It is located in the city near the Golden Gate park, lower Haight area. I think this is a local restaurant with a good number of Korean comfort food. Price: 4/5 - The prices here are pretty standard, but on the higher side since it's in SF. The bibimbop purple rice bowl was $16 with beef and the seafood pancakes were $12. Predictable Korean food and prices, The bibimbop was great at a good value, but I would not recommend the appetizers, since portion sizes are relatively small, so just go for the main course.Service: 3.75/5 - The customer service is pretty attentive and prompt, but not so friendly, nothing too outstanding here. Staffs were fine, but they are just focusing on getting the work done and close out for the night then trying to create a conversation with us or provide us with recommendations. BLUF: They offer a solid standard selection of Korean comfort food. Awesome food, pretty good vibes, in a great neighborhood. I would recommend the sizzling works rice bowl with purple rice, it was delicious. Definitely my go-to Korean place if I am craving for bibimbop.,This might be a biased rating because I'm not a city girl but damn these portions are crazy small. Although that's the case, the quality of the food is super good. I  wasn't sure about the shredded beef in the tofu soup but it works! Not sure when you get the bonchon for free but on the menu, it says it's $5. The soy garlic chicken wings were pretty bomb and had a nice glazed crunch. Be sure to ask about allergies cuz they sprinkle a little almond on topThe place is pretty small. Just be prepared to wait if the tables are full.,Bumping up to 4 starsI have to say that Purple Rice really hit the spot when I came the other night. Bibimbap was solid and I enjoyed the banchan. The kalbi also seemed better than the last time.Only downside is that prices are pretty high and portion sizes a bit small. But it's so nice to have an authentic Korean restaurant in Lower Haight that I'll give it a pass.,While I have passed by Purple Rice a number of times (on my way to Berliner Berliner, or Nara across the street), I never pulled the trigger and actually tried it. That is, until I had some friends in town looking for something relatively quick and unique. I of course gave them a list of options, but we settled on Purple Rice.The spot at the time was transitioning into dine in with vaccination - they had cleared out the middle of the restaurant, so the only tables were along the sides. They were doing table service, which was nice. As we were a ravenous bunch who like to share, we went with a lot:-Kimchi Pancake: two of us love kimchi, and it is one of their most popular dishes. This was a solid kimchi pancake.-Mung Bean Pancake: I had never ordered this before as the standard is kimchi, but honestly we were all impressed with it. The mung bean flour makes it a bit thicker, which was nice for soaking up various sacues.-Beef Mandoo: If I go somewhere with dumplings, I am ordering the dumplings. We absolutely killed these.For mains, while they do have grills and stews, we all went with the Dolsot Bibimbap, with purple rice, and mine without egg. We got one spicy pork, one beef, and I decided to go big and get the short ribs. These bowls were very nice and very filling, covered in vegetables, and the sizzling bowl cooks them from the inside, which is always fun. I was able to finish mine, but one of my friends ended up with enough leftover rice & veggies, bonchon, and pancakes for a bit of a late night meal later on.I like this spot, and need to come back when I'm in that part of SF. I am spoiled with a lot of the Korean spots in Oakland, and I have been to amazing Korean bbq in the city, but if looking for a solid rice bowl, hard to beat Purple Rice.,I came to Purple Rice with a friend, as we were looking for a quick restaurant to eat at in Lower Haight. On a Friday during lunch hour, the place was pretty empty aside from one other table eating. I ordered a Seafood Pancake and a Dolsot Bibimbop. For over $10, I expected a bit more than 8 tiny pieces despite it being pretty good. The bibimbop was a better sized portion with delicious veggies and meat - I was extremely content after this meal! Banchan was a bit on the scarce and sad side. Overall, a decent Korean restaurant in the area that I wouldn't mind coming back to!,Purple rice was a great experience. The waiters are super nice and chill and have their honest recommendations. I got the veggie tofu soup ($14) with beef+seafood which was an extra $3 but really worth it. The prices are affordable and it comes with an egg inside already. The soup itself really warms you up and I like how the veggies aren't too soft in the soup to give texture. The side dishes were also really good in particular the bean paste cabbage one we asked for refills so many times,A quiet little restaurant in Lower Haight! I ordered the vegetable soondubu because I needed a some TLC and coziness (despite SF being quite toasty lately). It was packed with different veggies and did not lack in flavor/gochugaru (a common problem I see in not-so-great Korean spots), so I had no problem finishing it off, along with the yummy purple rice.,I'm sure I've been in this venue in a previous incarnation, as this stretch of the Lower Haight was my favorite West Bay neighborhood when I first moved to the area almost a dozen years ago. It's now home to Purple Rice, which offers a standard selection of Korean comfort fare - think bibimbop, BBQ meats, jhap chae, ramen, and stews - at reasonable prices for the area.The beef bibimbop ($14) came with a modest amount of meat, a choice of white or purple (mixed grain) rice, and a topping of veggies. Since I stopped by in the late spring, before California lifted all restrictions, everything was packaged in to-go format, where they have specialized, tiered packaging that separates the hotter and cooler layers of the dish until you can finally mix everything together. Overall result: a satisfying, if predictable, comfort dish.,Pretty good!! I like how the portions are decent for 3 people and price was not insane. It was a little hard to find because the sign's font is a bit small but overall great service and great food! Chicken wings were A+++.,A low key Korean restaurant tucked on the haihht st in haight and Ashbury. The area doesn't have a lot of Asian food choices so finding a decent Korean restaurant is definitely a nice surprise. I actually came here for the first time four years ago with a friend, and things didn't change at all. Glad the place survived the pandemic. The menu is your typical Korean restaurant menu. The soon tofu is delicious but I wish the portion were a bit bigger. The service is fast and attentive. I would like to be back to try the friend chicken wings.,Cute reliable place for Korean eats. Good service and yummy foodSoondubu-- initially was skeptical because the tofu was served in large pieces, but was soft and yummy! Enjoyed the pork and dumpling too. Got level 5/5 spice, was not super spicy at all, so would order 5 if you like spicy! Dolsot -- my friend cleaned the bowl! Yummy :) Also decent banchan, although not that many options. The sprouts and fish cake were the best.,I have mixed feelings about this place as the food was pretty good but the serving sizes were very small yet overpriced. In addition, the waiters were a bit standoffish, which made the whole experience slightly unpleasant. FOODSizzling Works: Perfect for a cold day! I got it with thinly sliced beef and purple rice, an",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 it felt very soothing and healthy to eat! I definitely recommend adding the hot sauce for more flavor and leaving the rice to cook for a bit to get the scorched rice texture on the bottom. Seafood Pancakes: The taste was great, but it did not feel worth it to pay $12 for such few and small pieces. Banchan (side dishes): They didn't give many side dishes and also unfortunately didn't give the ones that I like. It would've been amazing if they had sweet potato, japchae, or just some more side dishes in general. It definitely felt that they were skimping out on side dishes compared to other restaurants I have been to.SERVICEThe service was fine, but as previously mentioned, the waiters weren't super friendly despite being attentive.,My roommates and I stopped here on a tuesday at about 6 and were seated right away!We shared the Kimchi pancake ($10), which was so crispy and so so good! I ordered the Sundubu (veggie soft tofu stew- $13), which wasn't overly spicy, but perfectly hit the spot for me. My roommate ordered the bimbimbap- sizzling works ($16), which looked so good and she enjoyed it. It was also a pretty good size! My other roommate ordered the Korean Noodle Soup ($15), which she also really liked. We also loved all the sides it came with, and they refilled it for us! Overall, the prices are super reasonable with good portion sizes and just really hit the spot. Can't wait to come back!,Service - 2/10Ambience - 7/10Quality - 5/10Value - 3/10Overall - 3/10Poor customer service - I was not very hungry but wanted variety so wanted to get the Kids Rice Dish," but the waiter said I couldn't get it because the menu said """"age 9 and under"""". I asked why this was and the waiter said """"I don't know"""". I tried the """"have you ever made an exception"""" and the waiter said"," """"Nope"," no one has ever asked it before"""" because they are not children. The waiter said other restaurant kids menus had the same policy (which I hadn't heard of before)", so I asked to talk to the manager for an exception and the waiter got flustered," cussing and saying he could cancel our items (party of six) and we could go somewhere else. This was just really unprofessional to escalate the situation with """"I don't know""""s and cussing. Not wanting to escalate and getting resigned", I obliged and got the Jap Chae Noodles.Jap Chae Noodles ($9) - 5/10 -- portion size was fairly good, but the dish itself left something to be desiredShort Ribs (large, $33) - 2/10 -- very overpriced, these short ribs are nothing special. The underlying shredded lettuce was charred at the bottom.The purple rice was interesting as a blend of six different rices, but it was a bit dry and left something to be desired. I felt a bit nauseous after the whole meal. The check came out to $28 per person, which was decent.,I love bibimbap and Purple Rice did not disappoint. I got the tofu rice bowl with the purple rice option and it was so good. I will definitely be coming back the next time I'm in SF.,Stumbled upon this place randomly while craving takeout one Thursday night. It's honestly great. I got bibimbap with chicken and extra egg. It was packaged very thoughtfully, and tasted great. The employees were also super kind and prompt when preparing my order. Will definitely eat here again.,I've only had the beef bibimbop rice bowl (with purple rice)... but I've had it over and over again because it's so good!,Came here with my sister for dinner one night when I was passing through the city; she's vegan so we had to find a place that had some options for her and this place fit the bill. I ordered their wings and it was fortuitous that my sister couldn't eat them so I had them all to myself :). They were bomb.com, .org, .net, .edu, all the domains! I need to come back because they cross my mind often. I wish I lived nearby so I could frequent this place. Their purple rice is pretty delicious!,This place is a really good Korean place if you want a variety of Korean food. The kimchi stew with pork and the spicy pork bibimbap is pretty good. The soy garlic glaze fried chicken is definitely the best though and it's a must get when eating here. This place isn't too expensive compared to other Korean restaurants so be sure to check it out!,I had Kimchi pancake and potato croquettes with beer. It was so good and nice to have good restaurant in San Francisco. You should definitely try it. Highly recommended.,The soondubu here is solid. Maybe not quite as good as some places in Oakland/West side of sf but it's still got pretty good depth of flavor. I think my main knock is you have to pay for banchan which I don't think I've ever had to do before. I guess it makes sense because maybe some people don't want banchan but those people are proabably psychopaths. Anyways, I wanna try the fried chicken and pancakes here next time I go.,I wanted BiBimBop & Japchae for dinner. My dining companion didn't know what to expect from Korean food. We each ordered a BiBimBop dinner and a Japchae appetizer. My only regret is that there wasn't enough Japchae, the appetizer was a little small & I was really in the mood for Japchae. Everything tasted very nice and the staff was very friendly. We felt welcome.A nice variety of traditional small Korean appetizers including kimchee were served. A waiter came once to ask if we wanted more of any of them. I said yes please to the seaweed & kimchee. I would have said yes to everything but I think my friend was confused because I think he thought refills cost extra and he was a little stressed out when ordering dinner.,I came here on a Sunday night after roller skating. It was really nice to be able to dine in after a long covid year. There are 4 sets of table that we can dine in. So there was a bit if a wait which was reasonable on a Sunday night. They have a menu posted on the window outside which has a variety if items to choose from. The wings do take 30 mins to make, so I do recommend that if you want the wings and your waiting on the waitlist. Order ahead so by the time you get your se a t the wing will be ready.We got the kitchen fried rice which came in a cast iron pan, which they allow you to choose your choice of meat. The options they offer are chicken, spicy pork, or beef. We choose the spicy pork which was not spicy, and not enough me as t to the portion. We also ordered the beef stew which was out favorite. Amazing flavors of beam sprout, vermicelli, shredded beef, green onions, and other items. It was the best dish ordered that night. We also ordered the seafood pancake. The seafood pancake was overpriced for the portion. Most places we get a huge circle or a pretty thick slice. But you only get 6 rectangle pieces. That was like a tease. I want to come back next time for the soup again, bimbibap, and the wings.,Should have read the reviews before we ordered from this place on DoorDash.  Ordered Gaibi for $27 on DD and it arrived with only 6 half pieces! Wtf?! Here is a picture.,Purple rice is the key Korean spot in the Lower Haight/Duboce Triangle neighborhood. They're a great lunch option, the Bibimbap have healthy vegetarian options, but if you want kalbi it's very good and comes with steamed cabbage wraps.It's on the pricier side, but I always take into account the neighborhood rent and the fact that I'm not gonna drive or pay delivery. And I've never met a Jap chae I didn't like. When I went to pick up, there was some indoor seating available for dining.,Pretty good Korean food! I got the spicy pork dolsot bibimbap, which came with seaweed soup which was delicious. Overall, this place has a very homey vibe and the food was pretty good. I think the bibimbap could use a little bit more meat but other than that, the flavors were all there. Recommend going here if you're in the area!,Craved some soup on a cold day, this place hit the spot. Their soft tofu stew had huge chunks of tofu, just the right amount of spice and went well with their special purple rice. Inside was spacious with a few tables and service was quick and friendly. They seem to specialize in bibimbap but have several other Korean comfort food dishes. Great find for Korean food in the neighborhood!,This was sooo delicious!! We got kimchi fried rice, spicy ramen, pot stickers and shrimp tempura. All of the food was fresh, full of flavor, and cooked perfectly. I will definitely be back!,If you love  Korean BBQ is now open! Come to Purple Rice in San Francisco.  Join Purple Rice for a fantastic 'LOVE SET' for the ultimate Korean BBQ Experience. Purple Rice specialties include home-made seasonal kimchi, delectable seafood pancakes, braised pork ribs, spicy squid sautés and Korean barbecue. Casual dining that will gladly accommodate large parties. We had great family celebration and fun experience with Korean food.  Incredible meal. The corn dumplings were the best dumplings we've ever had by far!,My favorite place to grab bibimbap or soondubu. There usually is no wait to sit down and the food comes out really quick. The banchan is yummy as well and they do refills. The service is really efficient and friendly.,Awesome food great service and exceptional vibes!!! Really great food that was surprisingly well priced and the customer service was exceptional! I got the spicy pork and short ribs and it was phenomenal definitely recommend if you're in the area!,SO YUMMY! and everyone is so nice and attentive as well! The waiting times were not bad for Wednesday night,Love love love the tofu/vegetarian bibimbap/dolsat. One of the best I have had in the Bay Area.,I didn't know I was missing this and now I look forward to eating here. I usually get a takeout bibimbap bowl," they call it """"the works"""" or something. I order it with spicy pork", purple rice and add spicy pork. Delish! Staff is friendly enough in our brief interactions. I highly recommend this place as a casual dinner or lunch spot.,"Excellent but super pricey food. Exquisitely prepared banchan (side dishes) but super tiny portions. $32 with tax and tip for a """"mini"""" beef short rib meal with rice and I was still hungry. For this price", find a hole-in-the-wall Korean place anywhere else in the city (or outside) and you'll go home fully satisfied.Pleasant, courteous service.,** The following review reflects my takeout experience DURING the shelter-in-place order currently in effect. ** I'd like to dedicate this to my father, Francis L.It's a song the girls in the band wrote, Lisa and Wendy...Purple rice, purple ricePurple rice, purple ricePurple rice," purple riceI only wanted to eat youBelching my purple riceI believe this is how the Korean version of """"Purple Rain"""" ended. OK", I made that up. It's actually the name of a fast food Korean spot in the Lower Haight that took the place of another Korean spot that I didn't even know closed, Stone Bowl Plus. I was taking my daily stroll toward the Haight and figured I could find some fuel to take home. Bibimbop sure sounded good, so I decided to park myself at Duboce Park and tap an order.Twenty minutes later, I picked it up, and a half-hour after that, I was home ready to eat. I tried the $14 The Works where they separated the chicken pieces, purple rice, and the sunny-side up egg (photo: bit.ly/2DpnYly) from ten different kinds of vegetables that included carrots, spinach, bean sprouts, cucumbers, zucchini, radish, and purple cabbage. There was a Korean spicy chili paste inserted in the middle of the bounty (photo: bit.ly/2P98EvY).Mixing it up thoroughly took a bit of time, but the result was a tasty, savory treat (photo: bit.ly/2PcEacw). For a side, I also ordered the $8 side of Veggie Jap Chae with stir-fried glass noodles, shredded carrots and cabbage, and sesame seeds (photo: bit.ly/33ajtWV). Definitely variations on a theme but delicious nonetheless. The complimentary kimchi, seaweed, and broccoli florets were a welcome sight (photo: bit.ly/33byEiP). I believe this is what happens when doves cry.FOOD - 4 stars...one Korean bibimbop traded for another, still quite good even after transportAMBIANCE - n/a...just takeout but looked emptied out relative to its Stone Bowl guiseSERVICE - 4 stars...timely preparation, masks onTOTAL - 4 stars...purple rice, purple rice...(hands waving in the air)RELATED - In the mood for Korean? Here's a collection of places I've tried and reviewed: bit.ly/2vxIt8t,Did take out and it was great, usually trying a place for the 1st time, there are usually 1-2 things I didn't like, but I liked EVERYTHING-everything tasted so fresh!  Now, right into the food.-7 Piece Chicken Wings: I like my KFC already coated and soaked with the red, sweet, sticky chili sauce, so I was very skeptical when I saw theirs had the fried chicken bare with the chili sauce on the side.  But I really liked it and was surprised to find that I appreciated getting the sauce on the side, you can really taste the rice flour/flour batter.  Get an extra side of the chili sauce, it makes all the difference in the world and is totally worth the $1.50.-Kimchi Iron Works-Vegetarian, (kimchi fried rice): I liked this too, (though I make a mean kimchi fried rice of my own).  I wished it had more kimchi flavor/salt but it was very fresh and the portion was a good ,decent size.-Beef Short Ribs-Mini: For the 2 of us, ordering 2 mini meats was just perfect so we can sample a variety.  In a mini," they give you 6-""""half"""" pieces or the equivalent of 3 strips of Kal-bi and the other Yelpers weren't lying", it is tender.  I wished it had more marinade flavor but the tenderness and bbq/grilled taste made up  for it.  Each beef dish comes with 1 serving of rice and some boiled cabbage, (I'm used to the fresh lettuce to wrap the meat in with some rice in but appreciated how pliable the boiled cabbage leaves were), and some bean paste.-Spicy Pork-Mini: A good portion for a mini and the pork wasn't DRY!  I am so used to dry pork slices when ordering from most Korean restaurants but it wasn't at all and it also had that freshly bbq'ed flavor.  I wish it was spicier-it's almost like the Owners toned-down the Korean food a couple notches for the Haight St crowed-which totally isn't necessary for San Franciscans, (most of us are Foodies).Next time, I'm gonna try the Kimchi Pancakes and spicy chicken and there will definitely be a next time.  All this came out to about $84 for 2 people-pricy but we probably ordered 1 thing too much and it's worth it for the freshness/quality.  Even though the banchan seemed scarce in the Yelp pictures, they gave us 3 containers of it and ALL of it was surprisingly fresh, even the fresh seaweed!,The best Korean barbecue i have ever had hands down! also what a wonderful location! My friend and I were overjoyed, not only the food was amazing, but also  the dessert was beyond our expectations. Everything we ate was incredibly tasty! Excellent service; everything is in order. The people that work there are so welcoming and nice that i just felt cared for and safe 100%. I adore Asian cuisine and Asian culture in general. I will tell all of my friends and family that this is definitely the place to go to if you want some good korean bbq. I believe they will fall in love with this place the moment they see it,Yet another solid spot in Lower Haight! Although the restaurant is somewhat nondescript, the food is actually pretty good! I got the sizzling bibimbop rice bowl with beef and was pleasantly surprised by the quality. Definitely on the more casual side but a great option for Korean in the neighborhood. Highly recommend if you want a good bibimbap spot in Lower Haight!,This review is based on service alone since we didn't end up actually eating here. 4 of us came here at 8:00 pm on a Wednesday - they had no waiting list and a 4 person table open right at the front of the restaurant. When we asked if we could be seated," we were shocked to hear that they refused to seat us because """"the kitchen was busy"""" and asked us to wait outside (it was a weirdly freezing day", even for SF summer, with wind gusts above 25 mph). When we requested them two more times if we could wait inside and be seated and that we were fine with waiting for a while for food if the kitchen was so busy, someone other than the host came hurtling at us and extremely rudely told us to leave and wait outside or eat somewhere else. Pretty shocking service. Needless to say, we left.,Love the food here, and they are so welcoming. We had the Dolsot and Pork Kimchi Stew, both delish!Oh, the ginger honey tea is amazing!,Came here for lunch (it's open for takeout). I ordered at the table (6 feet away from the cash register) and got the japchae with beef. My order came out pretty quickly and was packaged very nicely in a paper bag. I like that it came with a small box of sides and also came with utensils and a napkin.I ended up taking the food a short walk to Alamo Square Park to eat. The food was still warm after a 10 minute walk. Japchae looked small, but was surprisingly filling. Price and portions are on par with my expectations for SF. Thumbs up.,The bibimbap is really good, the lil side dishes tasted fresh. The only thing i would complain about is the lighting.Owners take note: Get rid of all the overhead harsh white lighting on the sides  and keep your warm lanterns. Place one or two brighter lights in the middle of the restaurant to create a point of emphasis and now you have a bougie, comforting environment.,My party of three came to Purple Rice Saturday night. We were seated quickly and waters were brought to our table. My friend who was vegetarian was happy to find that there were many vegetarian options for her (as a lot of the Korean broths are not vegetarian). The stews had the option of white or purple rice, as well as an option of protein (or vegetarian dumplings). The banchan came our after we ordered, and we were provided refills once we ran out. The waiters were very attentive and friendly, and checked in us a lot. As for the kimchi pancake, I wasn't a fan. They were crunchy but I thought there was way too much onion. And I can only comment on the Kimchi Stew (with purple rice), which was wayyy too salty for me. I ate a little by little while pouring in cups of water im between. Since it was a stone pot, thankfully the stew didn't become too cold from the water. I usually don't go to many Korean restaurants, and this one wasn't my favorite, but it had pretty good portion sizes and great service.,brought here by a korean friend, best Korean food in SF. Best bibimbap, tofu soup and great service. highly recommend,I can't remember the last time I was blown away by a restaurant but I'm so excited about this place I'm sitting here writing this review as I eat.Ambiance: 5/5 - I love how simple these restaurant is, no frills! Soft upbeat music, very spacious. It's empty now due to COVID19 but you know that even if all the tables were filled you wouldn't feel cramped and could still have a comfortable volume conversation. Not to hot or cold inside, perfect temperature!Service: 5/5 - I was immediately greeted and had water poured for me and was checked on in a timely manner, the server was so kind and warm, I usually don't eat alone but I felt that the hospitality here was so wonderful I didn't feel alone. When each dish came out it was very l, very intentionally placed and arranged in front of me on the table. It made me feel like I was at home (I'm not Korean but it felt very loving the way a Mom would give her children their favorite dish :)))Food: 5/5 - The food came out so quickly, it was really wonderful. And I swear the food stayed hot longer than normal - with the tofu soup scalding my tongue and the tea burning my throat, just the way I like it because I'm such a slow eater. And everything tastes fresh! Can't wait to try more things on the menu. Today I got the steamed vegetable dumplings, seafood pancake, soft tofu soup with beef, and vegetable japchae. The tofu soup came with banchan and the best part about eating alone is that no one tries to steal the best dishes from you ;)This place is definitely at the top of my neighborhood favorites, can't wait to come back soon!,It was my first time dinning at this place. The staff was wonderful. I ordered the spicy ramen and chicken wings. The moment I took a sip of the ramen soup, my pallette burst into these delicious flavors. I ordered it very spicy and it was so good! You can taste the seasoning spices. Very flavorful and I totally recommend it. I came here twice just for the spicy ramen. Great place! Great food!,"This is one of the best meals I've ever had.""""It wasn't just because he was hungry", he truly enjoyed all the flavors and spice levels. He's had Korean food several times but he really dug Purple Rice.Purple Rice doesn't have a huge menu: It's about choosing soup or iron plate and then your options. Add beef/pork/chicken or seafood then extras like kimchi and eggs.We had KFC ($12, just ok, the wings could've been meatier and better sauced) and Finn, a boiling cauldron of ramen ($12) and mildly spicy pork with eggs (extra $5).He finished the last third of a delicious iron plate I ordered ($14) also with spicy pork and purple rice ($3). The sauce mixed into the rice, julienned zucchini, seaweed and carrots was superb and united all the flavors with great umami flavor.The banchan was a little stingy, a distinct downgrade in quality and quantity from say, Um.ma in the Inner Sunset. They served it at varying times to the tables around us: As an appetizer, with entrees, it wasn't consistent. Service was friendly but uneven. The two servers quickly got overwhelmed by the dining room that went from nearly empty at 7 to packed 45 minutes later. They were also commandeering a steady delivery business.Dining room needs Feng shui in a big way, it feels sterile and uninviting. Lighting is harsh and pushes people away. The food deserves better.I waivered between three and four stars and upgraded my review because the servers were sweet and my son, a decent foodie," telling me this is his """"favorite restaurant of all time in San Francisco"""".That's a wow- so give Purple Rice a try.",We were looking for a lunch spot in Lower Haight on Saturday, and there are limited options because I'm guessing a lot of places are still understaffed. We ordered our usual (we have a go to when trying out a new-to-us Korean place) - tofu soup and a sizzling bibimbap. While the banchan portions are smaller than other places, there was plenty of food. Enough to take home some of my tofu soup! I ordered the tofu soup with seafood (medium - probably mild/medium at some other places), which was perfect for me. My partner ordered the sizzling bibimbap with spicy pork. Again, no complaints from him. Most of their dishes have a base price, and as you add on your customizations, it adds on to the price. They have lots of vegan, vegetarian friendly ways to build your meal. Service was prompt, and we were in and out of there in no time. Full, happy bellies. We look forward to dining here again!,On Mother's Day a friend and Idecided to go to the city just to hang out.  We weren't sure what we were going to do or what we were going to eat. So as normal I get on Yelp and guess what I found a jewel called the purple rice.  This restaurant is so special when I say it's the bomb oh yeah you best believe it's the bomb. The food was Delicious delicious delicious. I am getting hungry just doing this review. It's nothing like having good company and good food, and let's not forget the services which was excellent, very friendly plus engaging.  I love this place. Point blankI and I  would go back again and again. So thank you purple rice you guys did an excellent job and made my Mother's Day a very special day thanks again.,I ordered take out because I was craving some Korean fried chicken. I ordered their spicy sweet abs sour wings and bibimbap with spicy pork and it was fantastic! Chicken wings- super crispy, not heavily breaded, sauce is light. At first glance thought there wouldn't be enough sauce but it's actually perfect amount. The sauce is perfectly tangy and sweet and super light. Think with the sauce dish would do well if they had chicken legs too..Bibimbap- the veggies are sort of bland but I did like that because it kept the dish clean and light and the gochujang sauce was salty enough. Pork was a bit dry and can improve but overall, healthy dish and delicious!One thing I would love is if they gave more side dishes for to go orders (it was tiny amount) and white pickled radish for their chicken!,Finally a delicious Korean restaurant that has purple rice!!! I always have purple rice when I'm back in Korea and it's not something I find at Korean restaurants in the states. I only ordered from here but would love to dine in sometime soon. I ordered their japchae glass noodles and bibimbap rice dish. Both were delicious and had just the right amount of spice and flavor. Will definitely eat from here again.,Bibimbap: the container was very innovative. They put the veggies on top separate from the rice at the bottom and let you add the gochujang and mix it yourself. This helps prevent it from getting soggy. Japchae: satisfied my japchae cravings. Had a good noodle to veggies ratio. Chicken wings: nicely crisp on the outside. The sauce was honey based and very sweet which I enjoyed!,This is the best spot for a quick Korean food fix in the area. The staff was very attentive, the atmosphere quiet yet welcoming and the food was super yummy. Definitely hit the spot! We ordered the Japchae, the Spicy Pork, and the Beef Short Ribs. Will definitely eat here again!,Taste is ok, two-starish, but prices are ridiculous. As an example, the beef short ribs for $26. What you get are 6 micro ribs. About one bite and a nibble each--for $4! Considering the taste of the dishes is more in line with food court Korean, the prices are crazy, especially in the city where there are plenty of Korean restaurants with much better and more authentic taste (think Manna, on 10th & Irving). Very, very disappointed. I would give them one star but I only use that for restaurants that make me ill....,First time and it exceeded expectations. Dolsot and banchan were on point and at table after ordering. Nice staff as well.,+10 pts for attention to details. I craved for Korean bibimbab and decided to try out Purple Rice. Not only is the food tasty, it came in a nice package that separate the purple rice, egg and beef ribs vs all the vegetable. They also gave me a small box of banchan. Strongly recommend this place.,The tofu here is super soft and they have purple rice! The only reason why my rating is lower though is that compared to tofu soups in LA/Ktown, this wasn't great or hot. We had to wait SUPER long for our food. They apologized several times for this but I'm not sure why it took so long as the restaurant wasn't even full.,I ordered during COVID, and I really appreciate how tidy and well organized everything was when it arrived. They also don't use excessive packaging which is always such an issue with takeout. Let's get to the food though! Delicious. We got the works, rice cake soup, dumplings and the glass noodle dish. Great, colorful banchan on the side too! The beef is nice and thinly sliced, well seasoned. The seaweed sprinkled on top is such a great touch.  My only complaint is the rice cake soup is pretty salty. Will definitely order again!,Purple Rice's is a locally owned, wonderful BBQ restaurant. Many tasty foods to try. On each table are lot of bottles of different BBQ sauces. The menu includes budget busting meals, fried okra (yummy!), boiled peanuts, sweet potato fries. Meats include sausage, pork, turkey, chicken, beef, or combination meals. The baked potato with BBQ and cheese is my favorite. BBQ nachos are great as well! Choice of salad dressings include BBQ ranch! Service is very fast, friendly and accommodating. Spotless restaurant. Desserts include pie and donut holes (funnel cake batter, smothered in powdered sugar) - served warm. Sure to be a favorite. We eat at Purple Rice's twice per month. Purple Rice's caters too.,My favorite new Korean spot in the area. It is probably one of the more authentic joints that will serve some of the classic korean comfort food (and yes while the pricing might be a bit high for some items, it's San Francisco). The favorites from my household are the pork wrap, the spicy stew, and bibimbap. Can't go wrong with any assortment,I love this place! Always good food, the service is fast. I highly recommend the spicy ramen, and the  short beef rib. The dine in is definitely a must!,For standard Korean food, Purple Rice might be the best in the city. There's nothing particularly distinctive about the restaurant (aside from the trademark purple rice), but everything I've tried, from the bibimbap to the tofu stew to the rice cakes, was well made, homey, and authentic. Well, I can only assume it's authentic, but Korean friends seem to like the food too, so it probably is.The space is homey and not overly hip. The center table is weirdly large. Overall," great place to get dinner.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Santeria,"Came for a birthday happy hour. Our waiter (mustache and pierced ears) was a sweetheart and very attentive. We had: fried cauliflower, patatas bravas, chips and salsa, mushroom taco, pork taco, and churros. This place really knows their way around a deep fryer. Seriously cannot go wrong with any crispy. Tacos were a little small but a reasonable deal for the neighborhood with taco Tuesday.,Came here on a Thursday for a date night. Unfortunately they don't take same day reservations so we went the walk in route. While it looked as if there was plenty of seating, we were only offered seating at the bar if we wanted to sit inside (outside was a little too cold for us).Sat at the bar and the staff was helpful and attentive. My wife enjoyed her cocktail as much as they enjoyed making a show of serving it. All of the food was very good. The papas bravas were creamy and spicy; the esquite (corn) sweet & charred; the carne asada plate was as expected; but the bbq nachos were the surprise hit of the night. Would highly recommend them. The churros we're also a hit with us: crunchy and seasoned on the outside, but still doughy and chewy on the middle. They have taco Tuesday specials, which looked like they were worth checking out. Very pleasant experience overall, but missing the little ""wow"" factor on a couple of the dishes.,Rough nite at Santeria.  First, the place was absolutely freezing inside.  Next, it was nearly impossible to get the waitresses attention, either to take our order or to get the bill.  And when she did take our order, she read it back to us but then forgot to put in one of our orders.  When we asked her when his order would come she told us we actually did NOT order it, so I ended up eating mine so it wouldn't get cold while he waited for his.The food was actually pretty good, but it was such a bad experience we won't be going back anytime soon,Goooood but would be better with bigger portion sizes  happy hour might be the move over dinner! This place always looks very lively on the outdoor parklet seating during happy hour, so my friends and I came here on Wednesday evening. The inside is actually more intimate - lights are dimmed, the seating is swanky, and there's sometimes incense burning. The chips and salsa tray were fire - 5/5, everything tasted very fresh! For #Veganuary I ordered their Hongos and Nopales tacos (mushrooms and cactus). The veggies were cooked very well, and the pickled onions on top were a nice touch, but I definitely needed another taco or even a side of rice and beans or something more because I was hungry 30 minutes after I left. Really good quality for what I ate, but left me wanting a little more. Servers were very nice and attentive, we just had to keep asking for water refills bc we couldn't stop the eating chips ... :-) Gotta try this place for happy hour to know!,TLDR: Great margs, sunny patio, extensive menu.I've walked by Santeria dozens of times during my commutes through the Castro but never thought to stop in for a drink until a friend suggested it. I'm so glad he did!Though I have yet to try their food (unless you count guac, which was pretty good), every version of their classic margarita I've ordered has hit the spot. Traditional, prickly pear, guava, mango, and even the cucumber-basil were delicious!  I haven't seen their patio being heated (very well could've been heated at another time of day without my knowledge) but on a sunny day with little wind, you can't pick a better spot to sit outside and enjoy a refreshing beverage.,Came here for happy hour - apps and margs. For food ordered the cauliflower, patatas bravas, chips and salsa. For drinks ordered two margs, cucumber-basil & prickly pear. Food wise the chips and salsa were the real standout with the most flavor and portion size. The cauliflower sauce was a little bland but still hit the spot. The potatoes aren't exactly what I expected from other patatas bravas but it was still good. Definitely spicy and covered in hot sauce so don't get unless you can take the heat! Service staff is super friendly!! The ambiance of the place is also dope. The big tv by the bar was showing off dragon ball z and the World Cup. So it was giving variety and something for everyone.,My vegan friend was visiting SF and he wanted to stroll the Castro, so I looked into bars and restaurants in the area and picked Santeria since they have a few vegan options on the food menu and it looked like a cool spot. We arrived shortly after they opened on a Sunday afternoon and got a table right by the window which was perfect for people watching and we had a full view of the bar which is big and I thought we'll decorated. We had a few different folks take care of us during our visit and enjoyed a few drinks and shared appetizers. I loved the Girl de Polanca and while I liked the papas bravas, we LOVED the chicharrones and ordered a few plates of the. The vibe is very fun and upbeat, the staff was all super friendly and happy to help with menu recommendations, and I can't wait to return.,Came here for happy hour with my coworkers and ordered everything on their menu. Top highlights were the Mexican wings, Brussel sprouts, fish taco, guac and chips, chips and salsa, chicken quesadilla, whole wheat vegan chicharrones. The drinks were good and strong. Ordered 4 pitchers of margarita and they can do them spicy too. We ordered so much food the comp'd us the yummy churros at the end of dinner. Definitely looking forward to coming back here to try their other food. The owner was nice and kind too.,The food here was delicious! Came here for brunch after a workout session at around 2 pm on a Sunday and there was no wait for a table. Some of the highlights for me were the empanadas & the octopus plate. The empanadas were fresh, buttery and delicious! I personally didn't like the sauce it came with but ate it with the salsa they brought for the chips and dip. The Mahi ceviche and the huevos rancheros was good too but didn't quite stand out. I would say you could pass and try something else! For the lamb quesadilla, if you like lamb definitely go for it. But if you're not a fan of lamb and find it gamey, then this isn't for you. Our waiter was sweet and attentive despite the busy brunch time which I appreciated. To end our meal, we got the churros which is a MUST HAVE. Literally one of the best house made churros I ever had and I'm not being dramatic! The outside was crispy and sugary while the inside wasn't overly fried and slightly doughy/fluffy. It came with a sauce that wasn't too sweet either. You have to try it. Next time I'll be back to try their AYCE/AYCD brunch menu!,If I'm down to earth space in the Castro. Their bottomless brunch is easy and fun. Love all of the salsa selections.,Fresh off the plane having just landed at SFO, we were hungry and ready to eat. Thanks to Yelp, I had found Santeria beforehand and knew that we would be ok to dine in without a reservation on a Thursday night. We came in just after happy hour ended at 6:00 PM and were sat immediately at a bar table, and there were still lots of tables available. I picked Santeria because of their attention to gluten-free items (labeled on the menu) and unique menu items. We started with some drinks, the santería and the zicatela. Both very good. I also got a prickly pear chia lemonade which was nice and refreshing. Appetizers: chips and salsa. Chips were fresh and salsas tasty with good heat. Guacamole was not bad, could have used some salt. Papas bravas were spicy and flavorful, delicious. Dinner: quesa tacos were a hit. The kitchen was very nice to add shrimp to the tacos de hongos y nopal and the chicken tacos were both thoroughly enjoyed. You could tell the tortillas were homemade. The lamb birria was very tender and the consommé was pretty good as well, again I felt like it needed a little more salt. Overall we very much enjoyed our experience here, service was fast and friendly and the vibes were on point.,I came here for happy hour and got 2 margs with my friend and the salsa and chips and guacamole and chicharrones. The margaritas were light and fresh. They have a lot flavors - we got the guava and prickly pear and enjoyed. The chicharrones are actually vegan, but my friend and I felt they tasted very similarly to the non vegan version.,Santeria is such beautiful Mexican Restaurant in the Castro! I've passed it so many times and I can't believe I haven't been here yet. They have both an outdoor heated dining area and an indoor one. And one indoors is decorated with some of the most beautiful murals in the area. We came here for dinner, and everything was so good! From the hot chicken flautist to the juicy carnitas wrapped in banana leaves. The cocktails were amazing too. We even got a mezcal flight (they're pretty strong, so be careful! Haha). We had to end with dessert, so we got the tres leche and it was incredible! This is such a cute spot in the Castro. Props to our server, Jerry, and the manager, Alvaro, for giving us amazing recommendations on food and drinks!!,We came here after Barry's for delicious post workout food!Had the:1) Guacamole. Very tasty, and the star of the dish were the vegan chicharrones. The slight tang and spice complemented the guac well!2) Chicken Quesadilla. The dark/white meat was grilled to perfection and the homemade tortilla was delicious, light, and crisp. 3) Carnitas Tacos. The meat legit melts in your mouth like butter. I haven't had meat this tender in quite sometime. Flavor was good too. Happy Hour prices are excellent. Atmosphere is beautiful inside. Very thoughtfully curated and perfect for a date night with that special someone or fun with your friends! Will be making this my new spot to post up :),The outdoor parklets are super cute and there are a bunch of tables out front. Lots of drinks and eats on the HH menu (M-F 3-6pm) for only $8. There's margaritas of many flavors, frose, and sangria. Drinks were stiff, service was great, and we had a great time. Of the HH food items, we enjoyed the tacos and churros the most. Don't sleep on this happy hour!,Thank you Santeria for offering an amazing happy hour. I was able to kick off the weekend with my Yelp besties, Eric R. and Kyra K., by enjoying delicious food and refreshing cocktails. Thanks for a great time, y'all!-- FLAUTASAn order came with 2 perfectly crispy, crunchy flautas with chicken tinga inside. They were topped with vibrant and fresh shredded romaine, and pickled onions. I really liked the pureed avocado sauce on the bottom as it paired well with the cotija. I found myself scraping the plate to clean every bit of it up. The chicken could've used a bit more flavor though. I didn't realize it was chicken tinga until I looked back on the menu. -- CHURROSGet at least one order of this for the table! These fluffy babies were dusted in a nice layer of cinnamon sugar, which were already so good on it's own, but that dulce de leche dipping sauce? It took it from so good to so great.We also got a couple of rounds of drinks which included the frosé and multiple flavors of the margarita. My personal favorite was the frosé, but you can't go wrong with any of their drinks; all of them were a hit for us.So for anyone looking for a chill HH spot, Santeria is it!,The happiest happy hour I've been to! I'm so glad I got to dine at Santeria with some newfound friends, indulge in their happy hour offerings, and satisfy my Mexican food cravings. Their happy hour runs on the weekdays from 3:00-6:00 p.m. and they take reservations! My Yelp friend Eric R. brought up the idea of meeting up at Santeria. Although we didn't have reservations, we were seated as walk-ins outside where they have plenty of tables and heat lamps. Since we came during happy hour, we ordered off their happy hour menu which has various small bites that are big enough to be a meal! What caught my eye were the Carnitas Tacos--which are my favorite type of tacos. The Carnitas Tacos came with two tasty and filling tacos. The tortilla was homemade, the meat was tender, and the mild salsa and lime on the side paired well. My friends ordered the Flautas and Carnitas Tacos and we shared the Churros. We all loved the Churros which I highly recommend--crispy, fresh, and fluffy. I couldn't get enough of the dulce de leche dipping sauce that came with it. The parklet was casual, chill, and the perfect place for us to talk and catch up. The service was great and I didn't feel rushed at all. Our food and drinks came out fast, our waters were refilled, and everyone working was friendly and took good care of us! Parking is street only and an easy walk from public transportation. Santeria's happy hour hit all of my marks. The food was delicious, the workers were respectful, and the environment was welcoming. If I lived closer it would be dangerous. Muchos gracias to my Yelp friends Eric R. and Jennifer L. for such a fantastic meal and memorable night!,""I prefer love over sex."" - EnriqueHola! My experience at Santeria is based on Happy Hour in a very, very happy neighborhood:D Located in the Castro district is where I met up with Kyra & Jennifer (foodie and IRL friends) for some Mexican food! Quiero ser tu heroe! Let me be your hero...Rainbow flags flying everywhere, after all, it is Pride month and we're in the center of lovely unicorns, so of course we start off with colorful Margaritas. I had the Prickly Pear which was a fuchsia color, yet oddly I expected a drab light green (not sure why lol), and this bright drink really hit my happy spot! One of the lovely ladies had the Frosé and she enjoyed it! We also ordered some bites on the Happy Hour menu, including Churros (highly recommended), Quesa Tacos, Flautas. Our second round of drinks were all Margaritas, Mango on the rocks, Mango frozen, Guava on the rocks. For me, I preferred the Prickly Pear over the Guava. I didn't get the chance on the Mango Margarita, but both of my foodie partners agreed it was delicious. My only regret was not ordering more food during the Happy Hour, hey we were chatting so much :D, but at least we got in that second round of Margaritas jaja! Salud! In the end, do believe all the reviews you're reading about Santeria! The staff pleasant, professional, chill vibe and in the good part of America. The food delicious, but the drinks were the star of the show! And of course how can I not have a most positive experience w/ some of the loveliest people on earth!,We stopped in for their Happy Hour which lasts from 3-6pm Monday-Friday in what used to be Finn Town on Market Street. Santeria has retained a lot of the same look as the previous occupants but added their personal touches here and there to create their own personality. Service is excellent, friendly and accommodating. We had tasty  guava margaritas and a vodka/soda while sitting outside in their large parklet. Their Happy Hour menu has a good amount of food options so we ordered the carnitas tacos. There are two medium sized tacos per serving for $8. They were served in a soft shell with cilantro and onions on top. There wasn't as much flavor as I expected even with the addition of the salsa and a squeeze of lime. Three drinks and two orders of carnitas tacos came to about $50.,We were out galavanting with great friends late last night, and they brought us here. It's AMAZING! The owners of Santeria are so warm and friendly.  It's like they are welcoming you back home from a long journey. My husband and I were not big fans of tequilas and mezcal, but after trying out the drinks here, we've had a change of heart. They take pride in their selection of agave, and the skilled bartenders are mixing up drinks that bring on some nice saltiness and heat (great with the food).I had the Santeria (blue agave tequila blanco, el rey zapoteco mezcal, velvet falernum, house-infused jalapeño cordial, citrus, layered bitters, black lava salt) Hubby had the Mexican Gringo with tamarind-chili infused tequila, mango cordial, lime. Perfecto!!We also shared a round of beautiful mezcal (I wish I took a pic of the bottle). We just had some late night apps that truly hit the spot  and are also vegetarian friendly!! Get the Patas Bravas, esquires, and chicharron y Guacamole (whole wheat vegan chicharrones were phenomenal...and I'm a Meat-n-Potatoes person!)Will I be back? You bet! And I'm bringing the Familia with me next time!,3.5 ! I have looked forward to coming here for a long time, but sadly didn't think the food hit the spot given I wasn't eating meat during my visit. The menu looked great, but it was super limited in vegetarian and vegan options, so maybe people with no dietary restrictions will enjoy it more! I do think that the queso tacos with mushroom filling were really delicious and the chips and salsa were sooooo good - I just wasn't sure that the price adequately matched the portion size. I think I might try this place another time and see if I enjoy their happy hour, as it does have a very nice and cozy interior with great mood lighting and a nice atmosphere to catch up with friends.,Stumbled upon this gem in the Castro, they have a really good happy hour Monday through Friday 3-6. They also have a really good bottomless brunch on the weekend, unlimited drink of choice and food from a preselected menu for $55/person.My favorite thing I have tried so far here have been the nachos and the fish tacos. Super yummy fish tacos!Really good frozen & on the rocks margaritas - tons of flavors too!,Bottomless brunch is amazing here. I love that you can choose between margarita, sangria, and mimosa. The sangria is one of the best I've had! The food brunch menu is limited but you can keep ordering more of what you like. We tried all of the dishes but my favorites were the nachos and the churros. We saved churros until the very end but after tasting how good they were, wished we had them earlier on! If this limited menu was good, I can't wait to come back for lunch or dinner and try some of their other dishes and cocktails.,Highly recommend Santeria. Visited this neighborhood gem on a slightly busy Tuesday evening. No reservation and still sat us at nice table. The owner, Lalo (I think), served us our water and it was nice touch to get to meet the owner. Food:We the guac with chicharrones--very tasty. I had the Ensalada Fresa with shrimp--delicious and they skimp on the shrimp. My friend has the Queso Tacos with chicken--he recommends. Drink:I had the Santeria signature drink. Very tasty. My friend the the Spirit of Oaxaca. He ordered a couple more...it was that good. Overall: Great vibe. Top notch service. And great food.,Normally the review would be about the food here since I actually think it's quite good.  However I'm docking it a star because of how loud it is in there.  However the main impetus for me writing this review is the unnecessarily loud music they elect to play on top of the already cacophonous noise.  I was trying desperately to find a spot in the restaurant where I can hear myself think.  I finally asked the server if he could turn the music down and his response was ""oh, we aren't allowed to do that"".  So I left.  Bye!,The food is mainly tapas. It is recommended that you invite a few friends to eat together. You can try to order more dishes. Personally, I think I can give it a try, there are some surprises, but I don't think I'll go back again. We tried 8 dishes and 2 desserts, let me tell you what I think is delicious, I hope that can help everyone~ p1-2 uni scallop toastrecommend! The scallop is very sweet, and the toast is also very soft and dense. p3 yellowtail and figNot bad No big surprise, quite satisfactory,Delicious happy hour options (breaded cauliflower ftw!) from 3-6pm M-F. Great service and beautiful interior and outdoor area. Music could be improved, but that's subjective of course.,I discovered this on a previous trip,  it's now on my list of places to eat every time I am in town.   Part of that is because it is close to where I stay.  More is the food,  the happy hour prices and service,   Oh and the flavors.....This time I had a quesadilla,  a margarita and churros,  everthing was delicious.   The quesadilla had some spicy chicken in it, enough heat to be delicious but not so much to bother me ( note I usually avoid very spicy).  The drink was excellent and the churros were crisp on the outside but melted in my mouth.  The churros came with a dulce de Lethe dipping sauce...very recommended.The inside is a bit dark and well decorated,  there is the bar and tables for couples and small groups.Note I haven't seen kids on any visit,  it's a bar with amazing food and atmosphere.,I really enjoy going to Santeria compared to other places like Flores. Santeria has better quality and drinks.,Charming place with warm ambiance, nice parklet, and pleasant music. Also heat lamps! Service is friendly.Lots of vegetarian options and gluten free options. They make tortillas in house which is great. Chips and salsa comes with trio of salsa which is nice to have some to choose from. Guacamole is standard fresh guacamole but served with some vegan whole wheat chiccharones. Friends enjoyed all their cocktails including the hot papi  and passion fruit tequila  cocktails .The food was fine. My friend really enjoyed their ceviche. I ordered quesa taco with mushrooms - it comes two to a plate. I couldn't taste or see any cheese in it. It was fine but not great for me. Felt like it was missing the salty cheese to balance the flavor.I tried the Jamaica nopales tacos which the food runner had recommended and  which I shared with a third friend. I would not order these. I love nopales but the Jamaica was really hard for both of us to chew. I did like the smoky salsa it came with though.I hear that it may be a good brunch spot. I imagine perhaps the meat based tacos are more enjoyable.,tldr? Come for tasty and authentic Mexican cuisine, coupled with creative cocktails. Stay for the kind hosts and lively Castro atmosphere!!The vibes: IMMACULATE. We sat at the bar, and saw the bartender make some really delicious drinks. The place was pretty crowded, and was so lively and fun. Loved the decor as well!Chicharron y guacamole: Guac was so fresh, and the chicharron was so crispy. I loved the seasoning as well, definitely get this appetizer if you want something light before your meal!Birria tacos: Okay, yum. An elevated street taco, and a must get. The soup was so well seasoned and rich, and the taco was perfect.Carne asada: A lot of food, with tortillas on the side! Meat was well-seasoned, and everything worked really well together.,Worst Mexican food I've ever had. Period. Period. The chicken on the tacos was foul. I could not eat it, my boyfriend said he couldn't finish his because it started to hurt his stomach. Possible food poisoning, for real! The service was terrible, we were right next to the door and they did not check in with us or ask us why neither one of us ate our food (bc it tasted rotten!) PS- The only way you can get guacamole is if you get the large appetizer, you can't get it when ordering entrees, asked for some with taco entree and was denied. Wasn't too impressed with the salsa 3 ways, bland and hardly any flavor, but the tortilla chips were great! House made tortilla chips are delicious and the rice, the rice was made well, but literally everything else was Disgusting. I highly recommend never going here!,Came to this place because we saw it on Tik Tok and will definitely be coming back! We were a group of 9 who didn't make a reservation on a Saturday night around 7pm but didn't mind waiting. Upon being seated in the patio, our server brought out chips and 3 different types of salsa while we decided on what to order. We ordered two margarita pitchers for the table which was plenty. Both flavors were so good! We all mostly got small plates but I really enjoyed the tinga quesadilla.Overall, ambiance, service, food and drinks were great and I would definitely come back with a reservation to sit inside or try their happy hour.,I came here yesterday for the first time. Brought two old friends from back east. We hit happy hour, which goes till 6, and has some good deals.  The chips and salsa trio was nice. The guacamole and chicherinoes (sp) we're very tasty too. Everyone got tacos. My wife got the Brussels sprouts and cauliflower taco. She thought it lacked something like a cheese or guacamole to make it better. The two friends got steak and chicken tacos. And a side of refried beans. They liked it all. I got the chili releno. It was stuffed with rice and scallops and other seafood. It is actually lighter than it sounds. Filling but not at all fried-feeling.  Really delicious. I enjoyed it very much. I never order the chili releno but this is one of their specialties, for a good reason. Drinks - I had a red sangria, they offer white too. It was good too.  My wife had two Margarita. They were not consistent. The first one was great with a spiced rim. The second one didn't have the rim and wasn't as good in general. Maybe different bar tenders?Anyway, we'll definitely go back.,Every time I come in here, I love it. This time, they blew me away doubly and really shined. Wyatt, you rock!!! During a busy convention week in SF, I was struggling to put together a last-minute bDay thing for a Covid concsious friend. Not only did Santeria bring us delicuous bites and drinks in their outdoor parklet, but helped us to coordinate the event around happy hour and save us some dough. They took photos for our birthday group and came in at a fraction of the cost for an event booking. They just pushed a couple tables together for us. I don't usually order housemade liquor beverages, but theirs are so creative and delicious. They're casual, easygoing, effortlessly delicious and festive. Santeria, I will be back many times.,Santeria was even better that I expected! I went the other day for happy hour (they have some great deals) and ordered drinks and apps with friends. The nachos were incredible and well worth the happy hour price. As for cocktails, I had the Frose and a guava marg with Tajín rim and they were TASTY and pretty cute! Coming in second place for the food we ordered was the queso fundido. It was delicious, but the nachos were just a bit better. We also ordered the patatas bravas (sp?) and they were good, but nothing to write home about. The service was also quite good. The shift lead, Wyatt, was very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. We'll be going back!,TL;DR - the service goes above and beyond, while the decor and happy hour menu are a big bonusI've been here a couple of times - all of them with friends and sometimes for happy hour! They have the BEST ambiance - inside their beautiful restaurant with murals and gorgeous light fixtures, and outdoors and it's heat lamps and fake plants. They truly care about their look and feel!The drinks menu is great if you're looking for a good marg, and they even have a frosé! Pitchers to share if that's something you want instead. The food is great too - I had their birrira tacos  and salad. Everything was fantastic. Now the real winner of the night? (And really, every visit so far!) the service! I've had the pleasure of being served by Sandra and Alvaro twice now. The first time I went to Santeria I dropped my wallet and Sandra kindly noticed and returned it - and I sat outside that time!! Second time, we just had the best with both of Sandra and Alvaro, who showed us some great Prosecco and white wine to try. This is the spot!,Definitely have to come back for happy hour. The menu looked delicious. The churros were warm and delicious. The chips were fresh but the salsas were a little too watery and not spicy for my liking. We had just finished brunch to try anything else. We came for the drinks and they did not disappoint. The drinks were beautifully made and beautifully balanced. The bar set up is stunning and the murals are well themed. The color theme, furniture, and decorations couldn't be any better. Staff was welcoming and attentive. Definitely see myself coming back to try the food.,What? Anyways, this review is like the rim of the margaritas we got (Half tajin half salt).""I compare thee to a LIME scooter"" one of my friend says about his as pastor taco. I guess one never forgets how to ride a scooter.A friend of mine decided to feel up his beer and said ""There's an inverted nipped at the bottom of my pint glass."" Not sure if they have bottomless brunch, but at 10:50pm I wanted to see if I could find it. While I was rolling around in the barrel I found the bottom (shelf tequila). Now here I am writing this review. Food and margs were honestly pretty tasty. Time between sitting down, ordering, and food was a little long.Bonus thought- is a tattoo leg sleeve just half a pant?,I swung by for a Yelp Elite event and got their Quesa tacos and margarita to-go.- Quesa tacos: Tortillas were thicker than expected but everything else in the taco worked well together to give it nice texture and flavor. I could tell that the ingredients were fresh. I believe this comes with their house made tortilla chips, which were thin and crunchy. I especially loved their salsas which surprisingly had no spice to them. The employees here were friendly and kept giving me updates on my order. They told me my order would take 20 minutes but it took less time than that. I would love to come again during their happy hours on Mon-Fri 3-6pm :),Time & Date: Monday, Sep 27th 2021 @ 5:50pmDining: indoor & outdoor patioCrowd: not too busy on a MondayVery fortunate to have been invited to Santeria for a Yelp Elite event! I opted for takeout & received the Mushroom Queso Tacos & Sangria. The restaurant was nice enough to throw in churros with a caramel dip and chips & salsa as well! I was promptly greeted at the door and service was so warm and friendly. I was given chips & salsa and water while I waited for my takeout order to be prepared, and this was in addition to the bonus chips & salsa already part of the order! The chips were thin, crispy, & slightly salted and came with 3 types of salsa. QUESA TACOSThe tacos were like nothing I've ever seen before, in the best way possible. The tortilla looked hand made, and was thick & soft with a nice seared taste. One of the tortillas had a purple tint while the other had a green tint, I'm guessing 2 different types of corn were used. Atop the tortillas were a crispy layer of melted cheese (my guess), mushrooms, cotija cheese, pickled onions, guac, & some garnish. All the ingredients worked so well together in this delicious taco! The size of these tacos were also massive, I got so full from just one! CHURROSSince the churros were thrown in as a bonus, I ate that first because it was freshly fried & hot! It was crispy yet light, and had the slightest bit of spice. The caramel sauce was sooo rich & complimented the churros really well. SANGRIAI was told the Sangria is made with the owner's favorite recipe, and I can see why it's their favorite! It had the perfect balance of sweetness & fruitiness without overpowering the base. AMBIENCESince there's indoor & outdoor dining, you can pick which ambience you want to go for. Inside it's dim, with a red lit up bar, classy, yet casual. Outdoors on the patio serves outdoor brunch vibes with plant decor & a fire lamp to keep you warm. Both settings are perfect for a meal or drinks! (:,Much appreciated to Santeria for hosting this Yelp Elite event! I opted for takeout & received the Chips & Guac & Chicken Queso Tacos & guava margarita which was delightfully shared with my beau for his next day lunch for work. I even ordered the Half Carnitas for mom's lunch. The restaurant was so thoughtful to throw in chips & guac and churros with a caramel dip. I shared the chips with my beau since he's a big fan of housemade chips. The chips were thin, crispy, & slightly salted and came with 3 types of salsa. The waitress was so attentive and welcoming to the restaurant asking my preference for indoor or outdoor dining. I came on a weekday lunch time so I was not surprised that there was not much foot traffic but I loved the cultured interior design. I could imagine this would be a place I'd like to visit for the night scene. Chicken Tacos - 5/5 ! I can tell the tacos are what the people come here for! The tacos were absolutely delicious. I shared one with my love and the other for myself. We also threw on some shreds of carnitas from the other order. The portion size is not to be underestimated! The tortilla was hand made, thick, just the way we like our tacos. We loved the variety of color the dis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 had in appearance. As they say, the eyes eat first! One tortilla had some hints of purple while the other had a green. The tortillas were layered with melted cheese, mushrooms, cotija cheese, pickled onions, guac. We loved the presentation so much. All the ingredients paired perfectly in this quesa taco. I was full from eating just from one meal Churros - 4/5 Since the restaurant was generous enough to give us a serving sample of  churros on the house, I devoured that while I was driving home from picking up the order! Same as my beau, we love anything freshly thoroughly fried. This was crispy, light and had heavy flavors of cinnamon throughout. The perfect bite of churro. I've not had mini churros before and I loved the crispiness so much. It tasted like the caramel sauce was homemade and as a baker myself, I appreciate when restaurants take the effort to go the extra mile in making their sweets/desserts from scratch! extra sweetness means extra love! Guava Margarita - 5/5!! WOW this took me back to Hawaii sipping on guava flavored cocktails. This was amazing. I was so surprised when I was given the option of guava margarita. I'm not a whites cocktail type of girl. I usually like my darks very dark (ie: Manhattan and whiskeys). However I didn't hesitate an extra second when the waitress gave me this option. I was told the margarita is made with the owner's curated recipe, and I can see why it tastes so unique and has such powerful flavor! This is one rare cocktail that I would no doubt, come back for. Thank you for this opportunity to try Santeria and I can't wait to make another visit. This is the perfect location because it's just around the corner downtown where Beau and i work.,Yum, so impressed with this spot! There are a lot of amazing Mexican restaurants in the neighborhood, so I think we are hard to impress, but this place stands up to the challenge.First the service - Wyatt was the best server we've had in a while, friendly, efficient, thoughtful and with great recommendations! Drinks - we like a strong cocktail, these did not disappoint. The frozen margarita was nicely tart and surprisingly strong for a frozen drink. Our other beverages were well balanced and delicious as well. Craft cocktail caliber!Food - those quesa tacos! Oh my," the crispy griddled cheese and the thick tortillas truly makes them special. We also got their surf and turf """"sirloin shrimp"""" dish which we devoured. Love the chorizo crumble", very creative flavors.Looking forward to visiting again and trying more things from the menu!,Wyatt was our server for happy hour today and he made our first visit here so much fun. He was attentive and responsive to our every need- with prompt service and a friendly smile. I will definitely be returning AND DON'T SLEEP ON THIS HAPPY HOUR EXPERIENCE!!!,A charming little spot for Mexican food -- stopped by for a friend's birthday and had a great time. It was easy to make a reservation on a Wednesday evening and the staff was super sweet and helpful. The ambiance was great, decor really beautiful, and the food was tasty too! The chips and salsa were great and come with a trio of salsas, which means everyone was happy with the options. I got the Mushroom tacos and was a BIG fan -- loved that they had a tasty vegetarian option. We also got margarita pitchers to share and I particularly liked the mezcal one. I would definitely recommend and come back the next time I'm in town!,These tacos were so good!! Starting with the tortillas, they were awesome and nice and thick. The meat was flavorful as was the salsa that went really well with the pineapple. I haven't had pineapple on tacos before and definitely liked this flavor combo. When you get to your table they give you plenty of chips and 3 different red or green salsas. Thanks so much to the staff here that keep our chips and water refilled throughout the night. This place is also good for groups and were able to put two tables together for us.,I ordered a Quesa Taco Mushroom and a house special sangria which is owner's own recipe as I was told. The sangria looked and tasted nice and was served within 5 mins of the order. Though tacos took a bit but not very long. The two tacos comes with a side of sauce and are absolutely delicious. Initially I was a bit skeptic about the portion size, but I guess two loaded tacos were pretty good from a lunch portion perspective. I also got to try a small portion of their churros as part of the Yelp Elite Event they were holding that week and they were absolutely amazing too - soft, crisp, and just enough warm. Usually it comes with 4 pieces, but for this event they were doing a half portion (with 2 pieces). I planned to get a to-go from this place, but the place looked so pretty and clean, I first decided to wait on a table while my food was being prepared and then just sat there and ate. The staff was really nice in taking care of my order and changing the to-go order to dine-in instead. I surely recommend this place and I'd want to go back to try more of their drinks and vegetarian options.,Outstanding atmosphere here! Bar hopping in San Fran and found this place. What a cool place to stop in and grab some drinks!! Such a cool vibe! Food looks amazing but unfortunately we had already filled up and were just here for drinks. Great bartenders and amazing place overall! Definitely on the list to return when I find myself in SF again!,THI. IS. BEAUTIFUL. Definitely come here on a weekend and take part of that bottomless menu of drinks and food. The drinks, top notch with bubbles and margs. We downed so much. Food. Definitely get the churros. Idc if you don't like churros, get it! SOOO good! Everything else there is awesome too, but the dessert truly got me hooked. Since it's bottomless, you can keep going! I believe in you.,The queso tacos are delicious!! I love that they're colorful (green and pink ish from the spinach and beet taco shells) and the melty cheese on top...just amazing. I tried the mushroom queso tacos and I'm sure the other ones are just as delicious.Got a frozen prickly pear margarita and it was very strong. So well made too, refreshing and satisfying to drink on a hot day.Get the churros for dessert, you won't regret it!,Being located along the Market street, good luck trying to find any parking. However, it's really close to the main Castro neighborhood which is super lively. I was able to visit Santeria during a Yelp Elite event! I ordered the food for take out, and the servers were really nice and checked in with me often as I waited for the food, giving me extra chips & salsa and water.I got the tacos and sangria for free as part Yelp Elite event, and paid for an order the flautas during their happy hour. They also gave complementary churros and chips and salsa! The food was really good- the hack to take out is to pop it into the broiler for a few minutes to get the taco shells crispy and to melt the cheese. The serving sizes were unexpectedly filling though they look small.,My new go to place for happy hour and dinner!! The drinks are bomb. Tried the frozen rose and sangria. Tried the chips which are thin and so much better than regular tortilla chips, the flautas and churros. Went here for the Yelp event and also got more drinks. The flautas were flavorful and so delicious. Their happy hour menu has so many choices! Come here! You won't be disappointed !!The friend I went with who's super picky with her happy hour choices added this place to her list. If that doesn't tell you how great this place is, I don't know what will.,Very cute patio, awesome service, really good food! I loved my queso tacos! The taco shell texture is soft and chewy, with a little crunch. They don't break easily like the regular corn or wheat shells. One shell was pink and the other green, I forgot to ask what they were but they were so good!! I also liked all the fillings, the chicken and al pastor were both grilled perfectly, juicy and a little crispy, really good flavors but not overly done.   We liked the salsa a lot, the habanero salsa is the best. The margarita was really yummy too! We also liked the churros, the middle was so moist and soft, the syrup had a thicker texture to it and wasn't overly sugary.  Overall a great meal with friendly service, we will come back. They also have a bottomless brunch, the menu items looked great!,I came here for a Yelp Elite event but ended up ordering more food!Love the really cool vibe, art and decor of the place and the Latin music blasting in the background. Made me feel like I was at a cool bar in Mexico City!The drinks are Amazing!!!  The balance of the mango margarita w/ alcohol and tajine on the rim is crazy good!  But, you definitely need to try their namesake drink, the Santeria.  It will leave you singing in Spanish!Food was really good and there is warm chips served with salsas when you are seated.  The flautas had a great sauce.  Octopus was not too chewy but I didn't like all the extra pineapples in the dish!  My favorite was the carnitas tacos!  Tender and juicy chunks of carnitas!  There is happy hour Monday to Friday 3-6.  Many times for 7 dollars!  Excellent service and I loved the place so much that I went back the next day!!!Thanks Carmina and Santeria for this awesome event and introducing me to this place!!!,Nice place, kind staff! Margaritas are the bomb!But no many  veggie or vegetarian options.,Santeria is a solid spot for Mexican food and cocktails! I stopped by with a friend on a Saturday evening recently, and it was awesome that we were able to walk right in and get a table. The menu has some great options, and the vibe inside is really chill -- the staff is friendly and consistently helps with making recommendations from the various menus. The chips and salsa were fantastic -- a couple of their salsas have just the right mix of spices and yield a great flavor. Both my friend and I thoroughly enjoyed the cocktails and tacos we got as well! As a heads up, you'll get two tacos, but they're a good size, and have thick tortillas, so two tacos plus the chips and salsa makes for a solid dinner portion. I got the fish tacos this last time around, but definitely want to try some other options next time! Overall, would definitely recommend Santeria!,Saw this place on yelp and suggested to meet a friend from out of town and her two friends here for dinner. We loved it! At around 6pm (on a weekday) I was able to find street parking on the same block. The restaurant is also a walking distance from a dessert place, so I'd say it's in a convenient area. The food was good. I ordered the Michoacan carnitas, and had leftovers for lunch the next day. My picture makes the me look small, but with the three tortillas on the side it's a really filling meal. The four of us shared a pitcher of the prickly pear margarita. It was sweet and you couldn't really taste the alcohol, but we got a good buzz out of it. Loved the green sauce that came with our complimentary chips. Nice customer service and very cool atmosphere/decor. I'd definitely come back again!,Awesome vibe, great serviceMenu is diverse Definitely recommended Great choice of liquor Decor is definitely modern and the music is on point,Great drinks, attentive staff, dope interior, good happy hour with food & drinks.The food on the dinner menu looked amazing as well, I'm definitely going back to try a couple dishes that caught my eye. Their bottomless brunch is definitely next on the list though.,Drinks are really unique and so good! Came for happy hour and got the esquites and the wings which were both amazing! Service was great as well. Overall great vibes!,Keep the sangria flowing Came here for the Yelp event and was not disappointed! Service and the food was great and they had nice indoor and parklet seating.Food:Sangria 5/5:One of the best sangrias I've had in the city- it isn't overly fruity/ sweet but has a good rich flavor to it and is incredibly easy to drink. Must try Chicken Tacos 4.25/5:I really enjoyed the mushy textured thick tortilla (corn?) and the generous serving of guac and sauce on the tacos. Overall a super solid taco but the shell texture may throw some off.Churros 4/5:Solid serving of churros with a dulce de Le he dipping sauce,Delicious food, and great atmosphere.  Would come here again when visiting San Francisco,This is a story of a girl who got got. Bear with me because this is going to be a 4 part story.On this day exactly two weeks ago, 4G4C was in full effect in San Francisco. It was our last full day in the city and we were determined to go HAM. On the day's agenda was drinking and more drinking. Our night started here. My friend who got got decided to take 2 shots of whiskey. Not just any kind. My favorite brand that set me back over $200. We walked over to the closest BART feeling good. That'll happen when you kill a joint during the walk. Blame it on the joint and whiskey, we missed our stop TWICE. We ended up walking a little then realized we had no idea where we were so we ended up taking an Uber instead. All this commotion made us 30 minutes late which made me feel bad for our friend who was waiting for us. She ended up having a head-start so she was on our level when we got there. I was parched and starved by the time we sat down. I downed water then poured myself a glass of the pitcher of margarita waiting for us on the table. There was also tacos and guac with chips. I scarfed the taco down so I don't even remember what kind it was. I do remember it tasting good, but I didn't care much for the guacamole. We finished the margarita and decided to call it quits. They finished the food and we decided to move to the second place. All four places we went to that night were walking distance from each other. This was a great way to kick off the wild night we ended up having. The reason this was out first stop is because they had a happy hour menu. It was indeed worth it.,I came here to with some friends for a birthday celebration.  I read/heard about them through Yelp and decide to give the a try. The vibe was good, the service was decent and the food was good.  I'm definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu.  I say support your local restaurant.,I've been wanting to try this place for so long and finally got to this weekend. Loved everything about this place. We got the Santeria and La Botanica cocktails. Both were so good! Has a nice kick and both were on the savory side, which was perfect for the food we ordered. We ordered the fish tacos and salmon chamuscaso. The fish tacos came in homemade tortillas which were so fresh and thick. The fish was crispy to perfection and came with flavorful green sauce and chutney on the side. I think this is one of the best fish tacos I've had in a very long time! The salmon chamuscado was also amazing. This dish surprised me in that it tasted like a creamy Italian risotto with Mexican flavors. The rice was cooked perfectly as well as the salmon, and the Brussels sprouts on the side were delicious. Also, their homemade tortilla chips were super thin and crispy. Came with 3 different salsas, which were all so different from each other and delicious. Outdoor seating vibe was nice with heated lamps and warm lights. Definitely will return:),Absolutely LOVED the energy here - great Spanish music, cultural decor, colorful interior. Came here on Saturday ~4 pm after seeing tables outside filled with people enjoying margaritas. My friends and I decided to sit inside, which was definitely the move! There was a live DJ and drag queens since the brunch drag queen brunch show had just ended. What fun! Chips and salsa are complimentary here - our waiter didn't hesitate to refill after we finished the first round! They give a trio of salsas - all of which were fresh and delicious, though not very spicy.The prickly pear frozen margarita ($12)  was incredible! The ice was so finely grounded with the alcohol and I loved the salted chili pepper rim. I was also definitely feeling it after just one drink!The carne asada plate ($28) was delicious - it came with perfectly cooked steak, lovely purple homemade tortillas that were soft and warm, and grilled cactus, green onions, and jalapeño. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here and would love to come again, especially for their happy hour specials (Monday to Friday 3-6 pm)!,I'm not sure why I haven't gone here sooner!! Happy hour is 5-7pm and it does not disappoint. Cute patio seating and a good amount of indoor as well. Came for the Yelp Elite event, but definitely ended up getting more. During hh the Margs are ($8) and the guava one was so good! We also got several things to share and are all $7 during hh! Chicken Flautas- this was good, loved the sauce that came with it. Quesa Tacos- these were really really yummy- they stuffed them with a lot of filling and they were my favorite of the meal. Flavors were really good in these. The tortilla was interesting, as it was a little more chewy and soft, but still good! I would pick these over the flautas. Nachos- This is a huge portion size for $7 and they put a lot of toppings and a good amount of meat on this. I would definitely get this again.They gave complimentary chips and salsa. Overall, good service and really good food. Definitely need to come back for hh again!,Santeria is the perfect spot for great Mexican cuisine. Their menu has classic dishes like flautas, tacos, and tostadas. I tried the flautas - filled with chicken, cheese, chili, and topped with lettuce. This dish was presented well and so flavorful. Their dessert menu: tres leche and churros. Both were delicious, but the tres leche was incredible. The strawberries and rum-spiced vanilla cream complemented the light and fluffy cake.Santeria's drinks had to be my favorite part. They have cocktails, margaritas, and sangria. I loved the variety they infused into their cocktails. I definitely recommend the guava margarita.Overall, this place is a must-try! Great food, service, and location.,Cute place in the Castro. Beautiful decor and ambiance inside. Wait staff is very energetic and attentive.The tacos are the stars. How do you guys make your tortillas like that? I've had lots of tacos.. and Rico Rico .. the smaller sister of Nopalito that arguably has the best house made tortillas ---- dims in comparison to your tortilla quality. Great work. If you're looking for a stiff drink-- pregame elsewhere, although the margs are tasty, just little sweet. Your meal will be complemented by perfectly thin textured chips and three salsas to your liking. (Free refills too!),What a fantastic spot. Great patio with heaters and spacious, mural filled interior.Pros-abundant margarita options with chili salt or normal and frozen or on the rocks; I got the cucumber basil frozen with chili salt and it tasted like I went to the spa and got a massage with hot stones-free chips and salsa with top quality of both; the mild salsa had a hint of refreshing mint or something, it was fantastic, and the chips were perfectly crispy-quesa tacos may have been the best tacos I've had in my life-the churros and dolce de leche were light and sweet with nice crunch on outside and soft on the inside-the server I had was really lovely, almost asked him to be my friend I liked him so much lolCons -literally none**Disclaimer- I came here to redeem the Yelp elite event offer for Hispanic heritage month. I actually came by myself with the intention to order out but once I was there, it was so welcoming that I opted to stay and eat there. :),This was my first time at Santeria and I loved it! When we arrived it was happy hour 3-6pm (mon-fri) and we arrived closer to 3pm so it wasn't that packed. They checked our vaccine cards and ID's at the door and gave us the option of where we wanted to sit; we chose the back dining area. This place has such great aesthetics. They really knew what they were doing when they started building/decorating. They have the main bar in the dining area where you first walk in and then a mini bar on the back area. They have plenty of outdoor dining as well. The waitress was super attentive and immediately came out with chips and 3 types of salsa. One of the three was said to be more spicy, but for my palate it wasn't too spicy which I prefer. We ordered happy hour margaritas, guava and mango with a spicy tajin mix made in house. Both were really good, but the guava knocked it out the park. We also ordered flautas, chicken quesa tacos, esquites and a second round of margaritas, this time I changed my mango for a prickly pear. We also had the churros that were sweet, warm and soft with a dulce de leche dipping sauce. Everything was delicious. Both the flautas and tacos came with pickled onions which is my fave and also adds so much flavor to the plates. I definitely want to go back and try other items on the menu and maybe try their bottomless brunch which I noticed on a flier in the restroom which by the way was squeaky clean.,Really good place- we came here with a dog and wanted to sit outside. There was plenty of outdoor seating for our large party (although I would call and make a reservation if the party is greater than 6). The service was excellent. There is a happy hour until 6 pm and we got margaritas and a quesa taco. We split the carnitas between me and my husband and it was plenty of food. We even got extra tortillas (the tortillas were very good!) I would highly recommend coming here if you are in the area.,Great cuisines, I ordered the dishes and some grapefruit drinks to fulfill the dinner. Beautiful place and great environment,Santeria, why no carne asada nachos? Carne asada is on the menu, so they do have it -- they just won't pair it with nachos. The first time I went, they only had barbeque chicken nachos (a combination which seems odd to me), and the last time I went they had added carnitos nachos, which were very good. But they are no substitute for CARNE ASADA nachos.I love Santeria and am still giving them 5 stars even though they don't serve my fav nachos. Their menu is varied, their food is delicious, the margaritas are heaven-sent, the servers are super-nice, and they have great outdoor seating. Santeria, please!!! Please, please, please put CARNE ASADA NACHOS on the menu! Fingers crossed for next time!,Good, clean and yummy place. I been twice, 1 just for drinks and 1 for dinner and is a very yummy place. Very compleat menu. I love the happy hour i feel they have very convenient hours for the  ones who work until late afternoon. One thing Service sometimes is very very slow i will recommend maybe a few more waitresses on the weekends. But such a great place,The vibe and decor in this place is awesome. Plus the manager was super cool and took time to explain the menu items. I had the pulpo al pastor, which was delicious but needed some sauce to counter the brussel sprouts. Mole was amazing. And the mixed drinks were really delicious. We will definitely be going back with friends. Plus a must try is the Tres leches cake for dessert,We only came here for the drinks since we had some time to waste before we could check in to our hotel across the street. Very good margaritas and agua frescas. The servers were friendly and they had ample outdoor patio/sidewalk seating, as well as indoor seating.,Really enjoyed food and drinks at Santeria. My server Santiago was attentive, helpful, and kind. The atmosphere inside is perfect, it has great artwork, lighting, and comfortable seating. Tequila isn't my first choice of alcohol but Santeria's cocktails won me over. Thank you! I will be back!,Walked by and popped in for a quick dinner and we were so surprised by this little gem. Tinga quesadilla and chicken tacos were delicious. Red sangria was perfect. Highly recommend this place!,We wanted something light. The server was perfect. Had chips with 3 excellent salsas, flautas and outstanding wings. Together with the tasty margaritas, a perfect dinner,This place has potential, but the service is lacking. I came for happy hour. I was promptly seated outside. The menu is in the smaller side, but it has a good mix. The happy hour menu is a good value, but not great. Most items are about $2 off standard prices. The atmosphere is lively when it's busy and the bar next door is busy. This block gets a lot of sidewalk traffic. The food was a mix bag. The fundido was just ok. It looked good and was well plated. It's served hot but doesn't come with chips. I guess your suppose to use the existing chips you have. The dip itself reminded me of Rotel Dip. I've had fundido at other restaurants that was more complex. The tacos I had were delicious. Full of meat, vegetables, and well garnished. They not only looked great, but tasted good too. The tacos were well filled but still were manageable to eat. The salsas that came with the chips were complex and something I could eat frequently. Now the service... ugh. The biggest thing I see is a lack of hustle and a lack of common service basics. I was a server in the past. If you come out of the back room or kitchen plan on going to more then just one table. Carry a sanitized towel with you to wipe off dirty tables and chairs. Don't make the customer ask for chips and salsa that come free. Offer at least one water refill and don't wait until the customers glass is empty. Offer a new cocktail before the one their drinking goes empty and all the ice melts. Suggest item menu items. Offer dessert. Turn on the heaters when it's 50F outside. Maybe my expectations are too high.,We have been coming back to Santeria pretty consistently for the past 6 months and each time is just as amazing as the first. We also have introduced a bunch of our friends to it and they love this spot.I was incredibly impressed with how they handled my birthday dinner last Saturday. The reservation process, for a party of 15, was incredibly easy. We inquired on the website and they happily took our reservation. No pre-fixe menu or spending minimum, just a regular dinner - which is exactly what we were looking for.While we were there, our table was ready right when we got in there and we were seated. Throughout the meal, the server was attentive and food was brought out quick, despite our large group. They even held my cake in the back and brought it out!Santeria continues to amaze us!,The il pintor cocktail is to die for!!! My favorite cocktail of the entire weekend in SF. My friends all enjoyed their cocktail too but we could all agree I enjoyed mine most (it was gone the quickest haha). We didn't order food but I appreciated that they had many vegan/GF options. Also LGBTQ+ friendly! I'll continue coming back here when in town,My review is specific for Bunny, I walked in today to have a drink with my husband and the host sat us right away and sat us at the bar. Bunny the bartender recommended us drinks (by the Way his recommendations were beyond great) he was super friendly and made us feel comfortable and treated us like friends not like customers. Thank you Bunny for this great experience, will definitely come back.,O-M-G... this place is redonkulous amazing and full of good spirits and vibes. I'm so happy about the scenery, ambience, chic bohemian but very Hispanic oriented.

Delicious food and drinks. I'd recommend the ceviche and the steak. The meats were tender and juicy (giggity).",I go here a lot for the drinks the michelada is my go to before i start with the cocktails this is my go to bar and i love that they have food incase i get to buzzed to level me out hahah,I've been to Santeria twice and haven't been disappointed! The decor is cool and the atmosphere is nice. I've been on a Friday night twice and it hasn't been too crowded/not long of a wait.I've had the queso, carnitas, octopus, flautas and tres leches! I wouldn't order the flautas again because they weren't anything special, but everything else I would order again.Regardless of food, their margaritas are amazing!! We asked for skinny Margs and Santeria delivered. They have a breakfast too that I've been meaning to try.My star rating:5  - must go!!! 4 - liked it, give it a try!3  - it was alright2  - I probably won't go back 1  - turnaround and run,Great service, great food, great ambiance, great neighborhood spot.  I'm always so pleased with the experience there.  Wonderful vibe and always an enjoyable time.  What really makes the difference is the staff.  Friendly, welcoming and dedicated to excellent service.,Wow, their chips and salsa are so addicting! Drinks are strong and food is absolutely delicious, best Mexican cuisine in the Castro neighborhood for sure. Price is very reasonable and they have happy hour deals. Frozen margarita was 10/10! I first came here for a yelp elite event during the day, even their non alcoholic drinks are top notch. It's a bit loud at night but great vibes,Second trip back and even more blown away. The tres leches is to die for!I seriously love this place.  the vibe, the service, the food.   Check it out!,We were strolling the Castro and wanted a place for dinner end drinks. We came into Santeria with no reservation on a Saturday evening and we're promptly accommodated with no issue. The General Manager attended us himself, and he and his staff were extremely gracious and attentive. The food and drinks were spectacular. We were so happy with the overall experience and service. I would highly recommend!,My favorite spot in SF! I love everything about it, the food they have in the menu and the drinks are just perfect, the whole place is gorgeous and the service is amazing. I've been here a couple times and I love it more every time I get the chance to come back.,Great place to come and enjoy some good food and drinks.

I particularly like the guava margarita. We enjoyed the complimentary tortillas chips and salsa they were homemade and unique. The service was top notch and the ambiance was super nice. I highly recommend this restaurant.,I've come for brunch, dinner, and drinks and every time I'm blown away! The quality, taste, service, and vibes makes this a must check out place. Everything has been delicious, but the Al pastor tacos and Santeria drink have been my favorite. Can't wait to make my way through the rest of the menu!,"We tried the the """"new"""" ceviche which claimed it was crab & mahi.  It wasn't either", it was chicken of the sea in a can at best....not worth the $18.  When we commented on how horrible it was to the waiter, he admitted he's heard a lot of bad feedback.  But alas, no offer to remove it. Been here a few times. It's been a slow decline.  Good margarita. Food is not worth it.,"A solid spot! Came here on a whim as we'd just gone to a spot nearby and had a craving for food. The atmosphere was great with some really great drinks and food. While it's pricier it's about the norm for the city. I enjoyed the food as well as the staff! Everyone was very friendly and the place was very clean. Would definitely come back here again!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Tailor's Son,"It's no surprise that The Tailor's Son is often recommended on SF food listicles. The space itself is quite cozy, with many seats close together, and bar seating available. I definitely recommend making a reservation for weeknights and weekends.The cocktails were delicious, though the menu is quite small. The wines by the glass were also quite limited. The food was delicious. The Prosciutto di Parma was recommended by our server, and the gnocchi fritto was the right amount of soft and fried. The Focaccia bread is not on the menu, but I'd recommend it to soak up the sauce of whatever you order. There are two gender neutral restrooms at the back of the restaurant.,The food was excellent. Quality Italian fare and packed with flavor. The highlight was definitely the CANNELLONI. The cheesecake was light and refreshing.Price: $$Overall: 9.5/10Must get cannelloni,This was our first time at the restaurant and we are definitely planning to visit again.  Food- We ordered the tuna carpaccio and salt cod crostini. Both the dishes were super yummy.  For mains, we ordered the seafood pasta and the agnolotti pasta.  They were good but I wouldn't say unique or mind- blowing.  We ordered the cheesecake for dessert and it was good too.  Drinks - the cocktails were yummy. We did the caffe Negroni and golden cap. Delicious abs well balanced. Wine by the glass list was limited. Ambience - not super impressed with ambience.  I think they were going for modern diner kinda decor.   But it felt cold.  The chairs were not super comfortable to sit on as they had no cushions. Service- the service was good. The food came fast. The drinks came fast.  Overall, good service.,Great ambiance but the vibe from some of the staff comes off as a bit snooty? Can't really explain how but that's the vibe I get. I've tried:- Calamari (small portion)- Napoletana pizza fritta - Salami pizza fritta (don't get this, super dry and not much flavor)- Bucatini all amatriciana- Cocktails: with Prosecco, Negroni alpino, sprezzaturaOf all these I would recommend the Napoletana, bucatini, and sprezzatura!,Really not sure how this place has a 4 star average or a waitlist that can get up to 1 hour. After passing by this place multiple times and seeing how busy it was, my friend and I decided to make a reservation to check it out. We came on a Sunday night and was quickly seated indoors. It was all downhill from here. When we were seated we waited 10 minutes before a bus boy dropped water off at our table. I wouldn't have been as bitter about that if it wasn't for that fact that I felt like the wait staff was snooty or racist. There was a table right next to us that got seated 5 minutes after us. Immediately after that table got seated, they received water from our waitress who poured it for them! Not only that, we continued to sit and wait for our waitress to acknowledge us way later so that we could place our order. The difference in treatment was apparent right from the start. When the waitress finally acknowledged us, we ordered the Tuna Carpaccio and I got the agnolotti. My friends got the risotto and spaghetti alle vongole. The tuna carpaccio was alright. I did like the fried capers and the hint of chili oil, but nothing spectacular. After the appetizer, the food just went downhill. The agnolotti was fine but a bit bland and tasteless. The spaghetti alle vongole basically had no taste and a rather surprising amount of bread crumbs. The risotto just tasted like stale water. During the time of our main meal, not once did our waitress check in on us. She didn't even offer us a dessert menu while the table next to us got offered one. In the end, we had to flag her down for the check. All in all, would not come back. Bad service & bland food made it a poor experience.,I stopped by for lunch on a Sunday and was able to get a table right away! I tried the polenta braise - I LOVE polenta but it's usually hard to find on menus, so I'm glad they serve it here. The polenta was creamy and complemented by pork ragu. The poached eggs were a bit overcooked and too well-done for my liking, but the focaccia was so good - I only wish there was more of it. The interior is beautiful and there is ample outdoor seating. I'll be back to try their dinner menu!,+ we got a seat inside without a wait or res, at the window counter, was pretty packed on a thurs evening+ pasta and risotto were both very good, also enjoyed the dessert + super cozy, nice ambiance, great date night spot  - wish they had more chicken/vegetarian options,Great Italian restaurant on Fillmore street!I've been wanting to try this place for awhile now. Reservations are recommended . I got my reservation the day before with ease and not at an obscure time (7:45 on a Thursday).The interior of Tailors Son is so cute. It has a retro dinner vibe to me. Our waiter was nice too. She was patient with us since it was our first time here. I didn't feel rushed at all during our dinner. The food was very good! The pate crostinis were delicious. We also got the salad with ears and pomegranates. It was a great light and bright addition to our meal. Lastly, I shared an alla Milanese with ossobuco and a rigatoncini cacio e pepe. Those were amazing. We ate every last bit of it. I think Tailor's Son is one of the best Italian in SF. The vibes are great and food are great!,An average Italian restaurant with decent food but nothing to write home about, and service could be improved. We got the zucca ripiena, bucatini, agnolotti, and octopus. Everything was pretty decent but nothing particularly memorable. Service could be improved. I got there on time for our reservation, and told the hostess that my 2 other friends were right nearby but were running 5 mins behind. I saw that there were many empty tables at the time and asked the hostess if I could be seated first, given that I had been having cramps that night. She gave me the side eye and was like ""no our restaurant is really busy at the moment"". Look, it's okay if your mandate is to stick to the ""no seating until the entire party shows up"" policy no matter what, but a small act of kindness to acknowledge or sympathize with my pain would have been great.,Amazing food! We ordered the pesto ravioli on a whim, as it was a late night out and we didn't know what to expect as far as food. I've had drinks here before and they are okay, not amazing but not bad. But you must try their food! Their burrata with bread was really yummy, and of course the basil pesto ravioli was superb. I don't believe this dish is still on their menu,  but I would definitely try and ask!,I have had dinner here twice now and absolutely loved it each time. The appetizers I have had were the gem lettuces, a crostini with ricotta and figs, and the yellowfin tuna carpaccio. I had two pastas, risotto alla milanese and agnolotti del plin. The desserts I had were the budino and the mascarpone cheesecake. Their menu changes every month, but the risotto and carpaccio stays on the menu full-time. I really enjoy the rotating menu as it encourages you to try new things and experience more of their amazing food. I highly recommend the crostinis, though on the smaller side they are extremely flavorful. The tuna was great but pricey. Both the desserts were very good; the budino was especially rich and chocolatey.I loved both of the pastas. We had the ossobuco on our risotto alla milanese, which was so tender and soft. The agnolotti del plin was a small ravioli-like pasta with veal and pork in a vodka sauce. Unfortunately, that was no longer on the menu when I went the following month, but hope they will bring it back soon!,Based on our brunch experience, this is a worthy replacement of Elite Cafe. The remodeled space is bright and inviting. Dining options include inside, outside on the sidewalk, or outside in one of their parklet spaces. Carrie was gregarious, knowledgeable, and very attentive to our needs. The rest of the staff was very organized and efficient as well. Our party of 3 thoroughly enjoyed the Gem Lettuces salad, Polenta Braise, Spaghetti Carbonara, and Maltagliati.,Was researching some good Italian restaurants in the bay and the tailors son showed up on the list, so figured we had to try during SF restaurant week!We ordered the duck liver mousse bread, yellowtail, steak, and bucatini pasta. The duck liver mousse was *chefs kiss* SO GOOD. Super flavorful and rich, 10/10 would recommend. The yellowtail was a little underwelming but the steak and pasta both lived up to expectations.We sat outside and even though it was during fall and at night, the heaters were warm enough and the waitress was really nice too. Overall would come here again,LOVED my happy hour experience here. Happy hour is M-F until 6:30, and I made sure to get a reservation ahead of time on a Wednesday just in case. Perfect for date night or girls night out!Drinks- 9/10- great amount of alcohol with intricate flavors that go together really well Calamari- 10/10- Perfectly lightly battered crispy calamari came with a delicious sauce and thinly sliced potatoes-- would def get this every time I goMushroom Pizza- 9/10- THE BECHAMEL SAUCE WAS SO GOOD UGH and it all sat on this nice thin pizza doughRisotto Alla Milanese with Osso Bucco- 9/10- YES you have to get it with osso bucco (veal) otherwise the dish would lack depth. We decided to also add bone marrow and LET ME TELL YOU, it's a huge game changer. Loved this dish so much and it definitely filled us up.,Admittedly The Tailor's Son was not our first choice for restaurants in the area (we had our eyes on something a little more upscale) but it certainly exceeded our expectations!We began our meal with the burrata crostini. This is a hefty boy. The ""crostini"" is a thick cut piece of artisan bread toasted to perfection. The burrata version featured generous quarters of a large burrata ball and was then topped with pickled tomatoes. The pops of vinegary acidic tomato contrasted so nicely with the creamy burrata. The difference of textures between the different layers was also really nice.For mains, we shared the risotto with an addition of osso bucco and the maltagliati pesto. Both were honestly SO GOOD! The risotto was cooked perfectly with just a little bit of bite. The parmesan was light handed but added just enough nuttiness. Texturally, I really appreciated that this risotto was not a globby congealed porridge. In regards to the osso bucco, it was fall apart tender and so rich! It was a lovely addition to the plate!As for the maltagliati....that housemade pasta was.... phenomenal! It was silky and tender! It was also hugged generously by the freshly made pesto that was very basil forward which I really loved! The addition of long green beans and fingerling potatoes was interesting and playful. All in all, I could not get enough of this dish and even though I felt full before finishing, it kept me coming back and before I knew it, it was gone.Dinner with drinks and tip came to about $60 a person. We had a wonderful experience though so it was well worth the price!,Had dinner here with a few friends and wow I understand why it's always so packed!This has to be one of my favorite spots to eat on Fillmore. The food, the ambiance, the design of the place - everything was great. Service here was also top-notch. I loved all the antipasto. We got the panzanella (tomato salad), the calamari, and the erbazzone (puff pastry). The erbazzone was my favorite out of the three. The pastas were also so yummy. You MUST get the pesto pasta. It was literally the best pesto dish I've had in all of SF. I'd come back for that singular dish. We also got the pulpo or the grilled octopus. I thought it was a bit overcooked for my liking but overall yummy. Lastly, please don't skip out on dessert. Their berry crumble with fior di latte gelato was heaven in a dish. Highly recommend! One of my favorites for sure!,Meh. Soooooo expensive. I'm used to SF prices for mediocre cuisine (we really should have better food than we do here) but this was annoyingly disappointing. We got a glass of wine each, shared the crostini, one risotto and polpo and it's was $55 each with tip!!!. The risotto was bland (saffron - supposed to be popular). Not creamy at all in the home-cooked Italian kind of way the roots of this dish boast. Crostini good - on burrata- but small portion. The octopus was tender and juicy so ameliorated my displeasure at the overall meal. Overall a loud ambience and cold. Won't go back although my bestie lives around the corner and would have loved to try dessert.,Amazing food and drinks! Great service also and I thought the pricing was reasonable. If you want an indoor table be sure to make a reservation in advance,Second time at Tailor's Son and was seated immediately on a weekday night. The waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable and gave helpful recommendations. There were not many pasta dishes with protein, but I ordered the agnolotti del plin which had veal, pork, and parmigiano-reggiano.  The filling was chock-full of flavor and mixed well with the light red wine and tomato sauce. I wish the portions were a bit bigger but otherwise loved this spot.,This is a cute spot! Our waiter was hilarious and the restaurant is well lit and always bustling. We got the:Obsidian Cufflinks: Love a good bourbon drink (5/5)Wine: I don't remember which one we decided on, but the servers had great recommendations! (5/5)Burrata: Fresh, nothing special but a good classic (4/5)Radiatori al maiale: Al dente, great sauce, would definitely order again (5/5)Maltagliati: Pretty good! (4/5),Yum!  My faith has been restored!  There is great food to be found in new restaurants *grin*  First time at The Tailors Son. Honestly, went in with no expectations. Yes you can have great photos of the food on their website but does it translate to great tasting food in person?  In this case it does :)Very pleasant and attentive staff. Only hiccup I felt was the house cocktail Sprezzatura, which I found too citrusy (knows not a real word) I would like a hint of alcohol which I didn't taste. Otherwise they hit a home run. Very flavorful; dishes came out piping hot (luv).  Very little wait time between dishes. Four STANDOUT dishes were the tartare, shrimp risotto, Agnolotti (luv me some fresh pasta) and the Budino (who doesn't love Guittard  chocolate)   Will definitely be back to try the Alle Vongole!,Great atmosphere, drinks, and pasta! We got the risotto and clam spaghetti - both delicious. We were seated quickly at the bar and our orders were taken relatively fast. Would recommend as a great dinner spot to anyone in Fillmore area.,Stopped in for brunch/lunch on Saturday afternoon. We asked for a table outside and were told there weren't any available. A few minutes later two other walk-ins were seated outdoors which irked us.We both ordered the Pomodoro eggs based on our server's suggestion. The dish was incredible!! It was hot and served right out of the oven in a cast iron skillet. The eggs were cooked to perfection and the grilled pancetta was delicately cut and added nice flavor. It would have been nice if the dish included two slices of grilled crostini to mop up the delicious sauce. I would highly recommend the spot and would definitely go back.,I had wanted to really like this place but was disappointed. The atmosphere is fabulous (sat outside) but the pastas and crudos are just ok. And there are too many excellent, similar Italian places at this price point for okay!That said, the chicory salad was shockingly great. Unexpected for an Italian restaurant, but I will go back for that anytime!,One of our favorite spots in SF!ALWAYS the best staff and food.Wish I had taken photos of the food.Salads are amazing!Had a spinach soufflé that was delightful.The fish entree is insane.Cacio de Pepe is perfect.Seriously, love this place!Perfect staff, ambiance and food!,Not sure why I haven't reviewed this place yet. It's got a modern hip vibe. Nice cocktails that are not your run of the mill classics. The classic I do like a lot is a espresso martini.The menu does change over a period of time. The burrata crostini is fantastic. The pastas have never disappointed. Usually prompt service that's friendly and on point.,The food is excellent, the service is awesome, and the ambiance is amazing. I can't remember the name of my pasta but it was delicious! Hasn't tried anything like it before. The drinks were also so good, they were very summery and fresh. Such a cute spot! Would definitely recommend trying out their brunch menu!,I've been to The Tailors Son on two occasions. Once for brunch with my mom and boyfriend and last night for dinner with my boyfriend. It was super easy to make reservations and both times I was seated almost immediately. Both people that greeted us were also super kind and enthusiastic. We sat outside both times and probably would prefer that over inside. For brunch we ordered a few drinks (i don't remember lol) and some of the focaccia (i think? i forgot to take a pic). They were good! I remember the focaccia being a little spicy but I loved it. Then I got the spaghetti carbonara ($18) and it was so good. I was a little hungover so it was just the best thing for me in that moment LOL. My boyfriend and mom had a pesto pasta with pine nuts (i don't think it's on the menu anymore) and they both loved it. Service was great but they were a little busy during this time. For dinner last night we started with the gem lettuces salad which isn't anything crazy. It's a nice light salad which i enjoy but it's not gonna blow you away. Then we had the bucatini all'amatriciana and it popped off. I loved the little bits of tomatoes and bacon type meat LOL. It was so fresh and good. My boyfriend had the ravioli de taleggio which is so out of his comfort zone cause he likes burgers and mac n cheese like a 5 year old. He loved it tho and it wasn't too much food! For dessert we ordered the marscapone cheesecake and the budino. The budino was like a thick chocolate pudding almost and it was super rich and good. I am a cheesecake girl so I ate off the marscapone cheesecake which i loved. Anyways, I don't write a lot of reviews but whenever I come here it's always great service. I feel like a lot of restaurants in SF don't focus on great service but this place does. I am used to seeing my server maybe twice during my meal but ours came and checked on us multiple times! She slayed,Oh my goodness, I cannot tell you how good this honey nut squash appetizer is! We should've gotten three more, the flavors were so good, the squash was very tender, and it felt like the perfect amount before a meal. The octopus and the ravioli. It was also absolutely delicious. Unfortunately I did not get a picture of the squash ravioli, but it was probably was one of my  Favorite bites of the night. I definitely want to come back here!,""IT'S NOT WORKING. I'M GETTING OUT. IF YOU KNOW ANYONE THAT'S INTERESTED!"" - Mr. Big Never ever get advice from Mr. Big of TV's Sex and the City! First and foremost, my brunch partner was fashionably late, almost 30-minutes late for brunch. And she's the one who made the reservation lol. I'm not sure if it was Paris Fashion week or the need to be chic but I honestly did not like standing at the front staring blankly at the hostess. No text, no call, so as I apologize to the host for the third time she arrives w/ Bocelli... her adorable dog! All is forgiven!The Tailor's Son is a very popular Italian inspired restaurant in the Pacific Heights/Fillmore district. Reservations are recommended, especially on weekends, and why I was pleasantly surprised to be seated right away since Kim Cattrall was so late. It's a sunny day so it was nice to be seated at the parklet - a cute nook with lots of privacy. Like many restaurants in the city, outdoor seating is part of the new norm, and I love it cause it brings back fond memories of walking the streets of Paris and Rome. The cute high-ponytail waitress helped us. Um after  I regain my focus, we pretty much know we want brunch cocktails first and foremost! I start with the Tre Piece Cobbler Aperitivo. Brunch partner ordered the Sprezzatura. The Sprezzatura was a refreshing combination of Vodka, peach, pineapple, lemon, mint, sparkling moscato! ""Ms. Late"" enjoyed it so much, she ordered a second round, and I decided to go with it too! But! Let me tell you about the Tre Piece Cobbler Aperitivo! This was sooooo delicious! If you're into fun cocktails - Get it! You're welcome! ;) Kim Cattrall ordered the Vegetable Scramble! Straightneck squash, broccoli di ciccio, heirloom tomato, crème fraiche, breakfast potatoes. I ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara! Pancetta, egg yolk, black pepper, pecorino. Al dente but skimpy:3For dessert we split a Lemon Ricotta Pancake! Macerated berries, lemon zest... so heavenly! And yes, they were kind enough to offer a single piece.In the end, I recommend The Tailor's Son if looking for a wonderful Brunch option in The City! Loved the cocktails and the food. Nice airy space and warm vibes. Get the Tre Piece Cobbler Aperitivo and relive those fond memories of Mr. Big... uh huh! ;),Love the vibe and food/drinks were delicious. I've been wanting to go here for so long and finally tried it out last week. We got few cocktails and pasta dishes and appetizers. The tartare bruschetta was so good along with their pesto pasta. The only thing that I didn't like was their service. The hostess and our server felt a bit rude and un attentive. Even annoyed at us for ordering another dish later.,Tailor's son is always excellent for pasta in the Pac Heights area. The service is relatively quick and friendly, the food is balanced and usually not too salty, and the cocktails are strong. We've really enjoyed the spaghetti alle vongole, the bucatini all'amatriciana, and a pesto-based dish that I don't think is on the menu anymore (?).,Food was delicious! I've never had calamari like this but it was so delicious and not heavy. The pesto pasta was so good with some fresh pine nuts. You can really taste the handmade noodles,My friends and I went for the New Year's Eve prix fixe menu and I have to say that service, food, and the vibes were stellar. It was a five course menu and each course was generous, quick, and delicious. There was a hiccup with outside seating since there was a (nearly) record setting storm. The Tailor's Son was great with communication and very accommodating. It was a fantastic evening.Definitely going to come back very soon!,Beautiful pasta dishes at a very reasonable price point in SF. Great for a date or a friend dinner.,Came here for a friend's 22nd birthday. Really great venue with lots of open space. Food was slightly over priced as the portions were small, but was still good.However, I had the most uncomfortable experience with our waiter. He was fine until we paid for the bill. I saw a 5% charge so assumed it was a part of the tip, and decided to tip 10% (totaling to 15% tip). The waiter proceeded to come back and with rude and passive aggressive tone, announcing to the entire table: ""was the service bad because this is only a 10% tip."" Even after explaining that I misunderstood the 5% addition (that apparently was not related to the restaurant), he said ""oh so you're now only going to tip 17%?"" I ended up bumping it to a 30% tip, purely because we were all too shocked to even process his demeanor towards us.Will definitely not be coming back here, really unsettling experience.,Came here with a reservation on Saturday night with a party of 5. To start off they were super accommodating. I called when they opened to add 1 person to my party and to let them know I'll be little late and they were totally nice about it.Food: 4/5 I thought all the appetizers here were tremendous! My favorite was the pate toast (I don't know what it was on the menu because of the wording) and the calamari. The entrees however were just ok. I liked the mushroom risotto the most. We got the steak as well but nothing stood out to me for entrees.Drinks: 5/5 we got the spritz and the Paloma and both were really really good!Service 5/5: Service was great. Our waitress was nice and attentive.Overall I enjoyed my meal and would come back since it seems that they rotate their menu often!,The food is fantastic - a delicious departure from typical Italian fare with a Milanese twist.The duck pate canapé was a creative juxtaposition of savory and sweet, with a huckleberry chutney adding a bright accent to start the meal. The ink squid risotto was a deep, rich umami flavor immersion. The chicory salad was refreshing and crisp counterpoint.Atmosphere is a bit boisterous and loud due to hard surfaces. It's quite cold so I definitely kept my jacket on to insulate against the cool draft ones. Hence the 4 stars.Server was tolerant of us and not overly warm, but that's fine.This was a lovely place for a special birthday dinner.,Met up with a friend here for dinner one night. We were able to get bar seating fairly easily which was great as we wanted to start off with some drinks. We ordered espresso martinis (3.5/5), I wish they were a little bit more creamy, but still good! The lady sitting next to use was raving about the focaccia so we had to try! We ordered that along with our Agnolotti Del Plin. Wow! What a combo, I think about this pasta often it was so delicious and filled with flavor. I kept dipping the focaccia in the sauce, AMAZING! Overall great ambiance and great service. Look forward to going back and trying more!,Came here with a friend on a Saturday night. We made a reservation online and was seated pretty quickly. For drinks we got were the Aperol Spritz and Sprezzatura and both were very refreshing. We order the Polpo the grilled octopus, Rotolo, and Agnolotti Del Plin pasta. Everything was very delicious and high quality. The service was okay.... could be better Overall, I would come back here for the food and it's a nice Italian restaurant to chill with friends and family.,Popular Italian spot! Had a reservation for 5:15 on Friday and the restaurant was already super busy. The milanese risotto was the standout entree.,I recently came back to Tailor's Son to try their brunch. Once again I left with an amazing experience. I ordered the focaccia and mocha italiano to start. What a delicious coffee drink the mocha italiano was with the hint of orange. I've always wanted to try the lemon ricotta pancakes and they did not disappoint! So light and fluffy, I loved the sweetness of the pancake with the tartness of berries on top. Would definitely recommend trying out their brunch menu!,This place is a solid choice- food is good, but the vibes are definitely the highlight of the experience. The wait is a bit longer than I would've expected. We tried the carbonara pasta, the basil marinara pasta, and the lemon ricotta pancakes. The pastas were okay.The lemon ricotta pancakes were very fluffy and melted in my mouth. They were definitely the best dish ordered! The rosemary bread was also extremely good! Definitely recommend ordering this for a group of 3- comes 3 per order.We also ordered a handcrafted cream soda which was DELICIOUS. We also ordered a couple iced coffees which were tasty!! Service here was good. One iced coffee was forgotten until our check came but our waitress comped it.,Food was decent, but not great given the price point. For example, the rissoto was soggy. My main issue was food safety. We sat across from the kitchen and watched the guys back there pass around a bag of flaming hot Cheetos, a fine choice of snacks, but they were putting their hands near their mouths and then touching our dinners. I get that folks need to eat, but please wash your hands before interacting with our food.,We dined here recently for the third time and had a great meal! Started with some lovely cocktails with the calamari and chicken liver mousse crostini. For our entrees we had the risotto with shrimp and the short rib. Both were amazing! Finished with a chocolate budino that was delicious. We brought a bottle of Italian wine that paired very well with our meal. Our server was delightful and overall we had a wonderful dining experience. Can't wait to return!,A great meal. Wonderful concepts and perfect execution! Wonderful service. Perfect for a fun evening,They just opened recently on Fillmore! Indoor and outdoor seating with reservations available online. Modern interior and it was packed on a Sunday night! I ordered the veal risotto and it was so tasty. Melt in your mouth sauce with a hint of lemon. The veal had good flavor as well, but the risotto was definitely the star!My friend ordered the agnolotti, which had a delicious filling and yummy sauce. Will def be back!,Italy meets SF! I came here with a gf for the bar-service happy hour, and i was beyond impressed with the unique drink options, all Italian in nature, of course! The vibe was fun, and the interior design felt like I was dining 40 years in the past. What a cute, low key place, and the perfect fit for fillmore st!,The Tailor's Son has a beautiful aesthetic that drew me in for a Saturday brunch. There is ample seating inside and outside. With a wide selection of drinks and cocktails, there was a lot of great options to choose from. My Aperol Spritz was very refreshing and paired well with the meal. We ordered the pomodoro eggs and polenta braise. The eggs were quite tasty, with a gorgeous, flavorful red sauce. My favorite was the polenta braise. The party sitting next to me was raving about it and easily convinced me to order the same. The polenta was soft and creamy. I usually do not like pork, but I really liked this dish and the way they executed it the pork. Very tender and well seasoned. My only criticism was the amount of oil sitting at the top of the dish. I ended up skimming mine off as much as I could, which really helped. The dish was too heavy and for me, unappetizing if I did not do so. A solid brunch spot in the Fillmore!,I came here for my birthday last weekend and I was so impressed. The staff were so kind and accommodating for a large party. Each dish I tried was so flavorful. I ordered the Maltagliati, it was really fresh. I loved the appetizers, and they were really filling. The duck liver crostini stood out to me, both were super creamy. I also loved the yellow fin tuna, this one was more refreshing. Most appetizers were really filling so I'd definitely suggest sharing plates to make the most of your experience here.,Modern chic decor, fun vibrant atmosphere with a delectible menu! The cocktails were good. We started with the burrata and the carpaccio. The burrata comes with pickled tomatoes which are so unique. The carpaccio was fresh. Next we got the squid ink risotto and the rotolo which is a must try! Super delicious and a great night!,Not our first time here. We started with the Duck Liver Pate Crostini...the best dish for the evening. The duck pâté was silky and luxurious in taste contrasted by black currants and balsamic glaze. Next we had the Fritto Misto...a combination of vegetable in a light batter (Green Tomatoes, Onion Bulbs and Hen of the Woods Mushroom) with a light aioli sauce. This simple dish was a winner! Then we ordered the Cacio e Pepe Rigatoni. This dish which is normally my fave was underwhelming. It could have used MORE Pecorino and MORE Black Pepper. The last dish was the Risotto Milanese with Osso Buco (or Ossobuco). The risotto was rich and flavorful while the Osso Buco added to the flavor beautifully! The Focaccia was crusty on the outside and moist on the inside...and had a hint of chili on it. Our server Lauren was efficient and not obtrusive. The Manager at the Podium was a slight turn off. I asked to rest on a chair (I explained that I was handicapped) while I waited for my guest to park. He was unapologetic and coldly said he could not offer me a seat as all seats were reserved...while the restaurant was empty at this point at 4:55pm. Uncaring...,Interior design is very nice with great daylight shining through it windows and bar seating, and outdoor parklet booths (heated outside)The duck pate and pickled toppings on the Toscana Crostini was paired perfectly and would recommend it, would love to sample the other crostini toasts for brunch sometime.My friend and I shared Agnolotti Del Plin and Alla Ortiche Risotto. Loved the veal pasta and would get the agnolotti again. Risotto was not bad but not as impressive as the other two dishes we ordered. Service was okay, plates were changed after each dish we shared which was nice. Would highly suggest to opt for outdoor seating if noise level is not to your ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iking as it was quite loud and hard to hear my friend and I having a conversation with guest tables squished about a foot apart. Reservations are recommend even for a weeknight as we reserved for a 5:30 seating. I would suggest if you want to sit indoors to book early for the 5pm seating for a more relaxing dinner vibe, otherwise you will be stuck with a loud ambiance that kind of clashes with it.Might come back again to check out weekend brunch options and other dinner options, but would really opt for outdoor seating for dining here.,Tailor's Son is a place that is worth it's price. The pasta dishes are my favorite here. You can always expect flavor, uniqueness, and umami. I highly recommend this place for any special occasions or a fancy dinner out. I suggest making reservations in advance to assure a spot!,Recently moved to SF from the South Bay and have been lowkey struggling to find really mind-blowing restaurants, but I must award my first 5-star review to The Tailor's Son!! We ordered:- Yellowtail carpaccio: absolutely delicious, so refreshing and unique- Risotto alla milanese with ossobuco: definitely add on the ossobuco! The meaty flavor and texture helps to offset the creaminess of the risotto. This one lowkey reminded me of Indian desserts because of the saffron added to the risotto (but in a good way)- Octopus and chickpeas (forgot the actual name): perfectly cooked and the chickpeas soaked in allll the flavorEvery dish was outstanding and unique! I'd definitely come here again for a special occasion.,Nice ambiance and decent service for a date night or nice dinner. Been hearing lots of great things about this place but left a bit disappointed. The pastas (agnolotti del plin and spaghetti alle vongole) were quite bland and didn't stand out. Burrata crostini was pretty good although $17 for a piece of toast, burrata, and a few slices of persimmon is a bit high. Also, the portion sizes in general were extremely small for the prices. The only memorable dish was the risotto funghi. I'm glad I tried it out but I think there are better Italian restaurants in SF that have better flavors and value. I would probably only come again to try the brunch.,The Tailor's Son is a beautiful restaurant on Fillmore st in Lower Pac Heights. The interior is super airy and well decorated, and the food is delicious. It's a little on the pricier side and the portions are small, but the ambiance is great!,Beautiful light-filled interior. We came for the aperitivo happy hour and stayed for the fresh pasta.The Tailor's Son is a classic Northern Italian restaurant in Lower Pac Heights. Their aperitivo happy hour is 4-6pm daily, bar seating only. The HH menu is limited but the drinks and bites are so good. I stayed to enjoy their fresh pasta and authentic Italian dishes for dinner (highly recommend burrata crostini).,Came here for a Friday night date night.Not the top of my list when it comes to Italian spots in the city but I would recommend it if you are planning on staying around this neighborhood and hit some bars after. Food was very good, but did not blow us away. Service was good, even on what seemed like a busy night. Really enjoyed how much outdoor seating they offer,Pasta plus cocktails equals a tasty evening out.Sort of a hipster approach to old fashioned Italian recipes results in an often packed," but lively restaurant that delivers top notch flavors with minimalist flare. They use only the freshest ingredients and when they're out - they're out. This ain't no """"soup"," salad & breadsticks"""" at the Garden", yo.Yours truly can vouch for the risotto and cocktails; a golden combination. High marks for the carne cruda (tartare toast) too, 'Twas delish.,A few weeks late (I went in early December), but I had to write a review because this place is amazing. Hands down one of the best meals I've had in a long time.We sat at the bar which was super fun. The bartenders and waitstaff made small talk with us as they were making cocktails.For drinks we started out with a few vodka cocktails and then went on to wine. I took a picture of the wine we had which was from Sicily. It was a fantastic recommendation that was very Pinot-like. Super easy to drink but held up well with the food we ordered.For dinner we started out with the Chicory Root salad (described as a ceaser-like salad, which I thought was pretty accurate), the frito misto (yummy!) and also the focaccia that was light and airy but oh so delicious. A must get.For dinner we shared a few different things like the Agnolotti (which I would describe as a ravioli - truly the best pasta I've had in a long time - so so good!) and this octopus dish that was really good as well.We finished with this after dinner whisky sour type of digestif. I'm trying to find the name and will update this review when I do, but seriously, you must get it. I'm not a huge whisky sour person but this was delicious.Really hard not to keep writing more because I loved this experience so much, but all I can say is this place is great.,Such good food! Went with a friend, loved the menu. Loved the service. Cozy environment.,Checked out this spot for my birthday dinner. It was packed on a weeknight evening but luckily I made a reservation and was seated very quickly. They have FRESH PASTA! My entree was so tasty and delicious. We had the burrata crostini to start - it was literally so perfect and tasty. I had the delicious MALTAGLIATI for my entree. It basically consisted of pesto, fagioli, fresh pine nuts, and a little bit of crisp parmigiano-reggiano to top it off. It was DELICIOUS.And can't forget the amazing cocktails. I had the NUDO E FAMOSO mezcal based cocktail and it was the perfect blend of smoky and citrus to balance the flavors. I took one star off because I did not feel like they had enough vegetarian options on their menu. For an Italian restaurant, I felt like the non-meat options were very limited and so I felt like my entree options were very limited. But what I did order was great!,3.5 stars. Came here for happy hour with my partner. It's only available at the bar or window seating and the bar was quite full but we were able to sit at the window quickly and easily. The drinks were great! We got the Negroni Classico, Negroni alpino and the dressmakers shears - the last was especially tasty and came in the most beautiful coupe. We ordered the radish crudo, fritto misto, funghi and neopolitana pizza fritas which was perfect for a full meal for us. We were disappointed with the fritto misto where the hen of the woods had some batter left uncooked in it (though everything else was good), and the pizzas were a little on the extra chewy to tough side. The drinks were excellent though and I think we would come back just for those and skip food next time.,This place had such fast service and great food. I ordered the torchio pasta and frutti di mare risotto and both were delicious and melted in my mouth. The food came out so quickly and the place is nice. My favorite was definitely the pasta.,Food is solid, but super small portions.We made a reservation for 7:30 on a Tuesday, and it was pretty packed when we got there. They seated us pretty quickly inside.We ordered the Agnolotti del Plin and the Risotto with scallops. Agnolotti (5/5): The sauce was so tasty and the filling was delicious. Some reviews said it was too salty, but I'm pretty sensitive to salt and I thought it wasn't that bad. Maybe depends on the day?Risotto (3/5): The risotto was pretty monotonous. It was a little lemon-y, and that's it. The texture also wasn't as soft as I expected. The highlight was the scallop--cooked really well--but still it didn't have much flavor.Overall, service was good and some of the food was solid, but with the portions so small, plan to order more than a few dishes.,The cocktails, the burrata crostini, the radiatori with ragu... it was all so good. I recommend snagging a reservation if you can since this place seems to get packed easily. I didn't try the risotto but may want to next time!,Mouthwatering pillows of perfection is the only way to describe the agnolotti.I enjoyed the risotto Milanese with ossobucco and my partner stared at me as I ate since he's from Milano. He was waiting for me to say that his was better... which I didn't and couldn't...The Tailor's Son knocked it out of the park. For the grand finale we shared the budino which was incredible. The only thing I will do differently next time is either order that for lunch or have them take the espresso beans out for dinner time. They're super tasty but I stay awake with the littlest bit of caffeine.,I've been coming to The Tailor's Son since it opened in early 2021, and it's a staple for me for both brunch / lunch and dinner. The food is excellent, the service is awesome, and the ambience is amazing. They do an incredible aoerol spritz, and, seem to attract the hottest people in the city :). Couldn't recommend highly enough.,What a great addition to the Fillmore! I ate at the Tailor's Son and they have some good food sonnnnn!!! Excuse my corniness, but the Tailor's son is a great place for happy hour, dinner, or any type of occasion. For starters, my group tried all four of the crostinis - I highly recommend the duck liver pate with the huckleberry! They cut the crostinis into four pieces so it is very shareable or you can just eat it all! We also ordered the frito misto and the tuna carpaccio. These were also really tasty, but similar to what you usually get at other restaurants. Also stop the presses, they have a separate menu category for risottos! The Nero di Seppia (the squid ink risotto) was cooked perfectly and the squid ink wasn't overpowering like a lot of squid ink dishes. The pasta dishes were also cooked Al dente and you can really taste the sauce on the ragu pasta. Lastly, the pulpo was so delicious. The olive tapenade kind of overwhelmed my palette but the Negroni really complimented this dish and the pasta dishes. They have four Negronis on the menu and my drun..my cocktail enthusiast self thought the alpine was pretty good if you like bitters. If you prefer classic, you should order the Classico. I'm Filipino and I love drinks with pandan but the tropical Negroni made me question my love for pandan as it had a bitter yet sweet aftertaste. Maybe bc it has rum, but this was not it for me haha. Overall, the Tailor's Son has become one of my favorite spots and I can't wait to try more of their stuff!,***Updated to 4 stars: Despite the ambience problem, which could be easily fixed with sitting outdoors next time, the agnotti del plin here is still my favorite out of all the agnolotti del plin plates I have had in in the city:),Toscana crostini is a must have. One piece of toast sliced into 4 parts. The duck pate is rich and succulent, and topped with the perfect balance of pickled shallots and huckleberries.I wish I'd just stuck with the Toscana and not ordered anything else because it was all down hill after that. For an entree, I ordered the Risotto Alla Milanese. Unfortunately it was very bland. If you order this, maybe add the Osso bucco or bone Morrow,... might make it worth eating. I forced myself to try about 1/2 of it before I decided it was a complete let-down and I wasn't going finish it.The worst part was that the service started strong, but after my appetizer was delivered I was a forgotten customer and table. There's plenty of other things on the menu I'd like to try, so I might return, just hope the service is better.Overall, Toscana was 5 stars, Risotto and service 2 stars... it was hard to decide, but settled on 3 stars. Hopefully I can update this review and add a star or two in the future.,My friend and I stopped in here for a quick drink, after walking by and seeing how cute the restaurant was! I will definitely have to come back for food sometime, but the drinks were pretty meh. The happy hour prices are great, but the selection was pretty limited and I wasn't a huge fan of the cocktail I got. Definitely a cute spot for a casual lunch/dinner/drink!,What a fantastic spot for a hearty meal! Highly suggest this place for a semi-upscale dinner. Even on a Monday evening this restaurant is well attended. If dining in, they will check ID and vaccination cards.Everything on the menu sounded so good but I ended up going with their specialty cocktails (yummy), the burrata appetizer (scrumptious), spaghetti ale vongole (perfect), and the apple crunch dessert (to die for). I'm already looking forward to the next time I can go back and try more items on the menu!,Really enjoyed this place a lot. I can't remember the name of my pasta but it was delicious! Hasn't tried anything like it before. The drinks were also so good, they were very summery and fresh. Such a cute spot!,I went on a date here on a weeknight and was able to get a table super easily through open table's waitlist. Once I checked into the restaurant, I was seated immediately. They have outdoor seating with heat lamps to keep you warm. The food was delicious! I wasn't expecting the appetizer we got (thought it was going to be basic prosciutto and cheese), but the fried dough were puffy pieces of heaven! It reminded me a little of a sopapilla. I would go back solely for this dish, but the pasta did not disappoint either.,Deeeeeliciousness .!! The braised duck pasta.!! Yessss pleaseThe agnolotti.!!! Yessss pleasePanzanella salad... yessssss pleaseThe list goes on..Only thing I thought was meh was the steak tartar... nothing can touch the tartar at Bix. I love tartar and this one was just meh. Food fabulous drinks fabulous My advice to you:Make a reservation,Had a wonderful dinner and cocktails here.  Terrific service and food!I would recommend it.,Solid appetizers as well as main course pastas. I usually don't go out to eat Italian food, but I'm glad I tried this restaurant. The food was so tasty and nicely seasoned. Definitely top notch food especially for the price. Ambiance is also great.,Amazing food, great service another hit from Back Of House!!!! Highly recommend and they have outdoorSeating as well.,So sad, my boyfriend took me here for my birthday and I was so excited! It was on the list of 2-3 places I wanted to try and it was not a good service experience. The apps were good, we got some crudos, some crostini and the prosciutto but our waitress never came back over to ask if we wanted a main! We tried to flag her down numerous times but she just never came back! It was odd. In the end it was getting late so we got the bill and just decided to not go back. Overpriced and bad service! Apps were good though so idk roll the dice maybe?,Came on a Saturday afternoon, after the Spartan race.Sat at the bar, they required ID + vac card to dine in.Great environment, awesome company, good food and drinks, and delicious bartender.You will see me again!,I had brunch here today & it was delicious! My dining partner & I shared the lemon ricotta pancakes which were fluffy, not too sweet or dense & berry topping added a nice finish. My dining partner had the pasta carbonara & I had a bite of it & it was not heavy & had the perfect balance of cheese, cream & pancetta in the sauce. I had the veggie scramble which comes with crispy potatoes. I ate each bite of the light veggie scramble with a piece of the crispy potatoes which was perfect. For beverages, my dining partner started with the apple cobbler cocktail & I started with an Earl Grey tea. We both had the sprezzatura cocktails as our second beverage, which was light & refreshing, perfect end to our brunch.Service was friendly & helpful.All diners (indoor & outdoor) will be requested to show proof of vaccination along with a copy of your government issued ID.,modern place with good drinks they change their menu frequently, and I think they have tried to maintain their prices, but reduce the amount of protein or more expensive items in the menu. I believe it's suffered. I think they should've just raised our prices like a lot of places. They had staffing shortages, but once we got the food, some items look better than others to take it or leave it to me,I'm just short of being completely obsessed with this place.From the intricate white tile floors and library-style bar lighting, the decor is simply adorable. The atmosphere is energetic and fun! A great place for a date or to catch up with friends.I'm drooling just thinking about the food. Must order appetizers to share: steak tartare crostini and calamari (this isn't what you think; not fried, grilled and stuffed with a delicious olive filling). I order the risotto alla Milanese with osso bucco and bone marrow every time, and I've never looked back. My boyfriend always orders the rotolo.The drinks are so yummy. I always opt for the Tailor's Martini, which is refreshing and smooth. My boyfriend tries a new cocktail every time and he's never been disappointed.The wait staff is super friendly, and I was really blown away by the hostess. I showed up without a reservation on a Wednesday night with 3 friends, and Yelp said the wait was 100 minutes (!) I asked the hostess if she was able to seat us earlier, and she was incredibly nice and managed to squeeze us in. It's things like this that set The Tailor's Son above the rest.Pro tip: definitely make a reservation at least a week ahead of time (the wait is worth it)!,"Was able to score a same day booking via Yelp reservations for date night.  It was also Negroni week and Negroni is one my go-to cocktails.  I ordered a """"white"""" Negroni and it was delish! We also had wine with our main dishes...great wine selection.  The food was good...I didn't dislike it. We had the tuna carpaccio...I really liked it but my bf thought it was overly salty.  We both thought the squid ink risotto was WAY too lemony. Maybe they accidentally squeezed too much lemon juice or maybe it was meant to be that way IDK.  We both enjoyed the Torchio pesto pasta and the roasted mission fig appetizer.  Service was super friendly but very slow.  The restaurant was slammed at the time (Thursday evening). We received our cocktails after we finished our appetizers...would have preferred to before or during the course.  We even waited 5 minutes for the cocktail before eating our appetizers.  It was difficult to get our server's attention because she was genuinely hustling and trying to accommodate her many tables.  We were going to order dessert but our server never came back to take our order for it so we decided to just call it a night. We didn't want to take the chance to wait a long to time to order the dessert", then to the time to ask for the check, and then to pay for it (we waited a long time to pay that we asked a busser to give our credit card to our server). The restaurant definitely was packed and busy busy!We would likely return just for the cocktails but not so much for dinner.,Chef Tali is an incredibly talented chef de cuisine. This woman has taken the San Francisco culinary world by storm, first starting her career in NOPA and has made her mark on Italian cuisine in the Bay Area by creating mouth-watering menus at A16, A Mano, and now the Tailor's Son. Born and raised, in this city by the Bay, Tali is able to bring in the culture and love of our city into the food and restaurants she works in. If you are able to come by the Tailor's Son, grab a seat, get comfortable and let Chef Tali transport you to Northern Italy, with a modern twist. Create food memories,~Isabelle Pinard,Great local spot- cool music and wonderful food! Its one of our go to places in Pac Heights.,Great dinner spot on Fillmore! I've been a few times now and have always had a great experience. The menu is always changing, adding seasonal ingredients to the menu which makes it fun to come back and try new dishes. The staff is super friendly and the ambiance is great!,I know they are known for the risottos but I had brunch there. I had their version of eggs Benedict and it was delish. The parm crema as a perfect pair to this breakfast item. The service was very professional and knowledgeable on this visit.,I love this place! Went here for a mid week date night and this is probably one of my favorites in the neighborhood. Servers were lovely, food was amazing and ambiance was fun but not crazy! Bartender was very generous and knowledgeable. We sat at the bar as there was a longer wait for a table. Love my risotto with osso buco and bone marrow! Also got some other apps that was definitely worth trying. Will be back soon for sure!,Delicious pasta and appetizers!Grilled Octopus- large piece 5 starsRavioli- 3 1/2 stars Tuna carpaccio- 4 starsMission Figs with Gorgonzola cheese 4 starsFrutti De Marre Risotto- 4,stars Pesto pasta - 4 1/2 starsCocktails- vodka and orange juice 3 1/2 stars Ambiance - 4 starsCleanliness- 5 starsService - fast and efficient 5 stars,The Tailor's Son is STUNNING.I swung by for the first time tonight for dinner with my small dog/ESA Simba and I was blown away by how beautiful the decor/vibe is indoors.  I'm personally more comfortable with outdoor dining these days for several reasons, so I really enjoyed being able to enjoy the view of the gorgeous interior from my parklet table :)  Whoever designed this spot absolutely NAILED it--well done!!!The food was fantastic, and they have a beautifully designed, dog-friendly parklet with several tables and heat lamps.  I joined the waitlist via Yelp, but I would recommend making a reservation instead if you can as the wait time can fluctuate and may be shorter/longer than initially quoted on Yelp (pros/cons depending on how you're planning your evening) if you opt for the waitlist route. Service was fantastic--special s/o to the two hostesses working this evening who were super sweet and apologetic about the lengthy wait.HIGHLY recommend this beautiful restaurant. 10/10 will def be back, tysm for a lovely evening!! :),Golden Thread was a smoky, scotchy drink that grew on me as I drank, and was certainly unique, but not something I would order again. The alpino negroni, however, was excellent. Orange olive oil cake was very distinct, slightly savory with a strong olive oil flavor, some saltiness, and an excellent fennel creme. The rotolo and strozzapreti were fantastic...if a bit too salty. I've never had rabbit before, but it reminded me of a lightweight beef, and The Tailor's Son did an excellent job of preparing it, from flavor to presentation. The bechamel was a highlight! Just watch out for bones in the rotolo.Very cute ambience, great for dates. If you're looking for an Italian carb-splosion of flavor, come here!,How does Adriano Paganini do it?  Start belly, Super duper, A Mano, Beretta, Delarosa, The Anchovy Bar, Flores, Wild Seed, etc, etc.  Amazing that he keeps coming up with successful restaurants time and time again. (My faves are Wild Seed, A Mano & Flores).I used to live across the street from The Elite cafe over 20+ years ago and  have seen in change ownership and concept about 6 times,  some more successful than others.  During COVID it has transformed into a (limited menu) Italian place.  Sad to see the cool old booths have been removed. I know, I know - it creates more space, but I sure hope those booths went to  good homes!I do not like the mirror running along the entire back wall - does anyone like to see themselves eat?But onto the food. .. We split the burrata taste with picked asparagus (between 4 of us) for an appetizer. I ordered the rolled rabbit pasta, and hubs got the risotto Milanese - added Osso Buco.I loved my pasta, 3 pretty little rolls.  The risotto was okay, but the star was the Osso Buco.For dessert, the 4 of us split the pavlova.  It was fine, and a real sugar rush.We added the least expensive bottle of wine ($48, retails for about $15) - and it was about $53 including tip per person.,Tl;dr: Drinks are good, food is ok, service was meh, nice decor!Came here on a weeknight and this place is filled! We were sat in their outdoor seating area and really appreciated the heat lamp - it was a chilly night but it kept us warm.We ordered a tuna carpaccio, a squid ink risotto, and an octopus dish (polvo). The tuna and octopus were pretty good, but the risotto was way too salty :( Drinks here are delicious and I enjoyed both of them! I think I would come back for the drinks and try out other dishes next time- i'm sure i'll enjoy something else! Our waitress was inattentive and we waited for a long time to order but that was fine - gave us more time to chat!,Amazing food, great service, small town ambiance in a big city. We'll be back!The waiter suggested some of the favorite dishes and it didn't disappoint. Mushroom pasta was delicate and flavorful. My Ravi pasta with pork and beef was so yummy.,Great place. Came here on a Saturday night and it was very busy. The duck liver, steak, and bolognese were excellent.,Tried this place a very weeks back and enjoyed my experience! The staff was very accommodating as we showed up with 6 people, no reservations and an electric wheel chair. They were able to seat us within 15 minutes!The atmosphere inside was comfortable but vibrant! Clearly a well liked restaurant but it wasn't so loud we couldn't talk to each other. We got a round of drinks all of which were delightful. My boyfriend and I shared a summer salad and the salsiccia brunch item! Everything was delicious though I wish they would have seasoned or provided some sauce for the polenta. It was fresh and well cooked but lacking some flavor! We will be going back to give their lunch/dinner a try!,I've been wanting to check out The Tailor's Son ever since I've heard of their opening, and glad we finally did earlier this month.  We loved a Mano so we knew we'd enjoy their new venture too.  I made reservations online for a Friday night for outdoor dining.  We did have to wait about 10 minutes for seating as dinner seating opens at 5, while bar seating opened at 4.  Come prepared, even if you dine outdoors, you will be required to show proof of vaccination.  We were seated at a two seater table in the parklet, and eventually the parklet filled up before we left around an hour later.  It was a tough choice limiting ourselves to just one appetizer and salad, but we went with the Autumn Greens, and burrata crostini.  I asked our waitress if they had any mocktails and she said that they had some Italian sodas.  I usually don't order sodas but Italian sodas are so good.  I went with a strawberry rosemary soda concoction and it didn't disappoint, it was flavorful but not overly sweet at all.  For my main I picked the agnolotti de plin, and he ordered the Alla Milanese risotto with the bone marrow.  I do not particularly like Cesar salads but the Autumn Salad sort of reminded me of a Cesar without a heavy creamy dressing.  I enjoyed the lightness of the salad, but it still packed flavor with the mustard vinaigrette, shallots and the pecorino shavings.  I loved the added texture from the walnuts too.  The burrata with the delicate squash, hazelnuts and honey was pleasing as well.  Definitely better to eat with your hands vs trying to cut through the thick bread.  While I always love a good pasta, I was a bit envious of his risotto. The agnolotti were al dente plump little pockets of love but a tad salty, likely from all the grated cheese it was served with.  The risotto Milanese was delicious, although creamy did not feel heavy.  I joked with the hubs that he should've added the Osso Bucco on to it along with the marrow.  The marrow was only a $4 add on fee and was a decent size.   Bone marrow makes everything better! We did have a little room for dessert but nothing peaked our interest.  The Tailor's Son is a cute spot with outdoor dining and space heaters on busy Fillmore Street in Pac Heights.  Be sure to make a reservation on Yelp and order a few starters, and a risotto!  I would love to come back to try their brunch menu sometime," and to order my own risotto.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Um Ma,"3.5/5 A bit surprised by the outdoors brewery / beer garden vibes when we first entered the backyard patio, but I imagine it would be a good spot for elevated food in a more casual setting. Would be great for groups. Enjoyed the dishes overall, just thought some of them were more on the sweeter side than I would've liked or needed an extra layer of flavor at the price point. Service was solid. + Rockn' roe (3.5/5): Definitely unique but slightly underwhelmed by this dish. The purple rice is a nice touch and the seaweed salad adds contrast but the flying fish roe feels more like an added texture than added flavor - I kept finding myself searching for the ikura in each bite to add another pop of flavor. + Bone marrow / Sul lung tang (4/5): Dish itself is just a few ingredients (noodles, beef, & scallions) but really enjoyed how flavorful and umami the broth was. Great complement to the heavy sweetness of some of the other dishes. + Bulgogi (4/5): My friend loved this - I thought the meat was really tender but the sauce was a bit too sweet. Needs a rice dish to complement, glad we ordered the rockn' roe. + Tteokboki (3/5): Liked that this came with fish cakes! I'm a sucker for those at H-mart. But I found the thick sweet and spicy sauce to be too overpowering, to the point that I could only eat max one rice cake at a time before alternating to other dishes.,Stopped in Um Ma on a Thursday night for dinner and I would say it's good but definitely on the expensive side. The restaurant was nice and we ended up sitting outside on the back patio. Service was pretty minimum, we actually barely saw our server. Seafood Pancake - my favorite thing that I ordered, it was delicious and I loved the chunks of seafood. Good shareable portion. Wings - got 10 wings with all three flavors and overall it was tasty. Bibimbap - got it with pork and when it came out it was steaming hot which is great! But wished it got more of a crispy bottom.,Um Ma opened right after I moved out of the neighborhood and I've been wanting to go back and try it -- so glad I did! Every dish we had was delicious and it was reasonably priced for the portions and quality. Highly recommend the chicken wings.They have a super cute back patio and were very welcoming to my dog who enjoyed any food that may have dropped from the table.,Ugh. Bummer. I heard good things about um.ma and was so excited to go, I'm sad to report I don't have many positive things to say. The service was okay, especially for a slow rainy day. No one was at the tables inside, but we got seated on the covered patio during the rain, with the heater it wasn't bad, but I'm curious why we didn't get the option.Yuza blonde: love a yuzu blended beerPilsner: on the menu it says draft $8, but our bill said $12... Waiter later told me the can is $8, draft is $12, well why does the menu not differentiate between can and draft? You are lead to think there is only draft for $8!Chicken wings: good, nothing crazy, but the best thing out of the meal. Citrus gochujang wasn't too spicy!Kimchi fried rice: meat is an additional $4, but the menu doesn't list a price so it seems like it's included. So it's braised kimchi, rice, egg, and green onion - 4 ingredients for $16? Not worth it.Bibimbap - same issue with the menu, thought meat was included in the price. This came out so hot, absolutely steaming, that it wasn't edible for about 10 minutes. The rice completely burnt around the edges of the stone :( and the flavors blended together into mush since it was so hot... All in all, no buenoBefore we left I told the waiter about the confusion in the menu (draft beer price +$4, meat additonal +$4 for both entree) and she said, ""Sorry, do you want a refund?"" each time. Perhaps this is me just me, but I expect proactivity from a Michelin rated restaurant - ""I'm sorry, let me refund you, I can see why that's confusing."" Instead it makes me feel like a complaining customer. I'm giving you valuable feedback about something that is truly misleading.... Take it or leave it, but I unfortunately won't be going back.My star rating:5  - must go!!! 4 - liked it, give it a try!3  - it was alright2  - I probably won't go back 1  - turnaround and run,Came on a really cold day, and korean food was on our radar for comforting, warm food. But really, who doesn't like korean food? This place takes reservations as it does get fairly packed, but if you're lucky, you might just get a seat or table. We came during lunch, and we ended up sitting in the patio which was really nice, but sooooo cold! But luckily there were heaters everywhere so sitting out there was bearable. It's located in the Sunset and if y'all know it's a horror to find parking in. UmMa is like a really nice modernized korean restaurant and it's a great place to come to enjoy some good comforting meals. Our table ordered a couple of things, but we got the chicken wings with all 3 flavors: Citrus Gochujang, Honey Butter, and Ginger Soy. All were really good!  But my favorite was the Citrus Gochujang. I love saucier wings and this hit the spot. To go with our starter, we got the Soondubu-jjigae, kimchi fried rice, pork bibimbap, tteokbokki and the seolleongtang. My favorite was the kimchi fried rice! First, I loved that they used purple rice. So unique and the whole dish itself was so smooth and buttery with lots of good flavor stemming from the beef. The pork bibimbap visually was beautiful but I thought the cuts of veggies were a little too large and I felt like there wasn't enough rice to accompany all the toppings on it. Everything else was good too but I thought the tteokbokki was a miss for me. I thought the sauce didn't really do it for me, and the rice cakes were a little too dry as well. My friends and I all agreed too. But the kimchi fried rice is a must have!Overall, this was a great place to come to. I would definitely still come back and it's a great place to go with friends as well. Also, this is my last post of 2022 so cheers to more food and reviews in the future!!!,My second time @Um Ma...first for the rest of the group. Some were impressed, the others not to so much at this Michelin star rated restaurant. We arrived kinda late stuck in parking lot traffic at the de Young...but didn't have to wait too long. I did call for resies on Wednesday for our party of 9...they were able to accommodate us even if they couldn't find the reservations. So that was nice of them on a bustling Saturday night. Ordered a bunch of apps and soju and milkas and then Bone Broth Soup and Soon Dubu and a lot of other delish dishes...it's not bad. The chicken wings were noted to be a bit on the sweeter side moreso tailored for americanized pallet, instead of the spicy bold Gochugaru - red chili flakes that korean dishes are recognized for. So all in all, it was good. Service was sparse, as one of the servers stated she was drowning in the back patio, which were mostly big tables and charcoal BBQ tables. The restaurant itself had a cool modern vibe, eclectic mesh of modern traditional art. It was fine all and all, but expect to pay some extra money for the food ordered. SF price standards, so splitting the bill isn't so bad per person. Bday girl had a great time so was wellworth it for sure! Kasamnida! Muchos gracias chefs/cooks!,Went with a big group of people on a Friday night. we had a reservation at 7:30pm, and what I appreciated was that they accommodated us even though we had more people than we listed on our reservation (I believe the max people you can reserve for online was 6 people. Any party larger you would have to email them for the reservation).We order a few items: seafood pancake, Korean fried chicken wings, kimchi fried rice with bulgogi, and soondubu.The seafood pancake was okay, and I thought the kimchi fried rice could've used more kimchi and an egg on top to make it better. The soondubu was actually pretty spicy. I enjoyed the wings the most, and I liked how we were able to get all three flavors. Overall, it was not as great as I thought it would be but if I were to go again, I'd definitely go for the wings.,Cool twist on traditional Korean food, very modern, open setting and a cool vibe. There were traditional tables inside, but the back patio (sheltered from the elements) is where it's at in a picnic table setting with the open format. It was spacious.Our party of 2 ordered the seafood pancake () and the bone marrow broth () to share and it was plenty of food. We also ordered an extra bowl of rice and surprisingly it was the purple rice, a very deep purple rather than a plain bowl of white.  The seafood pancake was probably one of the best I've had of the many Korean restaurants I've been. It's bigger than most and generous amount of seafood (shrimp, squid rings, scallops) and served with an amazing soy dipping sauce. The bone marrow broth with sliced brisket & some noodles was also very tasty...every spoonful tasted almost like mom's, very comforting. It was delicious comfort food experience and I would definitely come back. The only downside is they are located in a busy part of the inner sunset and street parking is difficult.,Came here with 3 of my friends and we ordered 6 dishes to split and everything was very decently priced for the serving size! (Super worth it!) had good service & the food had very unique flavors. Was a huge fan of the kimchi fried rice and pork belly. Additionally the tteokbokki was sweeter than I had anticipated, but was a good balance of sweet and spicy. Among the different fried chicken flavors, honey garlic was my favorite!! Overall, one of the better korean food places I have been to in SF & definitely think it is worth a visit,a little sad because this place has been on my list and was on Michelin Bib Gourmand but the experience and food was just overall very underwhelming P A R K I N Gparking in this area is always atrocious, expect to make a few circles or walk a few blocks unless you're lucky! -- 2/5S E R V I C Ethere is some seating up front but I believe the primary seating is in the back. due to this upon arrival there was a good amount of time before we saw a server to take us to the seating in the back. QR menus and you order through your server. place was relatively empty and service was pretty lackluster, especially considering the price point. -- 3/5 F O O Dbulgogi bibimbap: The bulgogi urself was good but everything else misses the mark for me. Rather than the veggies being thinly diced allowing you that kind of 'all in one bite', these veggies were HUGE so either carrots were overwhelming or something else was. sullungtang: wish they used glass noodles instead because the noodles they used just end up getting soggy after 5 minutes and I just ended up eating the meat fried chicken: pretty good, very crispy but also very sweet seafood pancake: sister really liked it but I found it relatively mediocre as wellO V E R A L L lots of other good Korean spots in the city that I think can offer better bang for your buck and overall experience,heard a bunch of good things about um.ma, but was underwhelmed - food didn't stand out and seemed to be more americanized. would recommend grabbing a seat in the patio - cozy picnic table vibes w lots of heaterswe ordered:- honey butter fried chicken wings (4/5): wings were perfectly crispy and covered in sauce. the honey butter sauce was unique and very sweet, i'm glad i tried it but usually isn't my goto korean fried chicken  flavor- seafood pancake (1.5/5): was honestly very disappointed by this - it was mostly batter and had very little seafood (i think only shrimp?), but it was crispy and soft inside- kbbq la galbi (4/5): meat was good, wish you didn't have to pay extra for ssam and veggies- sullungtong (3.5/5): broth was comforting and really enjoyed the thinly sliced brisket, but the noodles were so soft almost mushy - banchan: wish there were more options, but enjoyed the quail eggs and purple rice!,Rockn' roe: 4.6/5. Was my favorite dish. The purple rice that they use really makes their rice dishes stand out. This was something I don't normally have so it was my favorite from the dishes that I tried out. Kimchi Fried Rice: 4.4/5. Again the purple rice made this dish stand out. Loved the green scallions on top that cut the greasiness but flavors that didn't really stand out. The dish seemed more americanized. Kimchi Jjigae: 3/5. Nothing special. Was on the spicier side and had pork inside. The kimchi flavor was good but it didn't come with any rice and was on the saltier side. Pork Belly: 3.5/5. Standard pork belly that is well seasoned. The citrus gochujang sauce was the star of this dish but for the price the portion was smaller than expected. Kimchi Pancake: 3/5. Maybe should've tried the seafood pancake but was disappointed in this dish. Very standard flavors that didn't really stand out. There's seating inside and outside. We chose to sit inside because it was a cold day and raining. There's street parking that was pretty convenient to find because there are a lot of stores on the street. There's a cute bookstore and other dessert places to go which was nice. The service was good but the ambience was a little uncomfortable? There was someone cleaning while we were eating. Overall, probably wouldn't come here again just because the food prices weren't really worth the quality or quantity.,My last two visits here weren't as good as the previous three visits. Last time I thought it was because I decided to try a new dish rather than my usual favorites. I got their brisket and shrimp juk (rice porridge); I usually love rice porridge, but wasn't a fan of that dish which was not on the menu currently. I got my usual favorites sullungtang and kimchi fried rice. Food was still good but maybe our sever was new. Our server didn't give us any banchan, but I noticed another table had it so I asked for it. We got four dishes of banchan this time including the quail eggs which were good, and she gave us a free refill. Our server said they now charge for tea which they didn't previously. I'm not sure if our sullungtang still came with rice since we didn't ask for rice. The sullungtang didn't come with any salt, but was seasoned. The kimchi fried rice had a lot of scorched rice so rice was very hard and crunchy, but I still enjoyed it.Maybe because they reopened the seating in the front where so we sat, the servers were serving both the front and the back patio so they weren't around too often. My bowl that they gave me was dirt, but the server wasn't around so I walked up to the kitchen staff and they said I can get a new bowl myself.,After a cold night outside at Golden Gate Park checking out the Halloween festivities, my girlfriend and I made our way over to UmMa as it was not far from us. It was a restaurant I had seen online, and I was curious about how they would make their homemade style Korean food. When we arrived it wasn't too crowded, and thankfully we were able to be seated immediately. The interior is decorated nicely, and we were able to order pretty quickly.For the food, we decided to get the Soondubu-JJigae (Korean Tofu Soup) and 10 Korean fried chicken wings. The tofu soup comes with enoki mushrooms, smoked pork belly, and sides of purple rice. While the soup was good, I think that it was on par with other tofu soups I've had in the past and didn't blow me away. The chicken wings on the other hand were excellent, and the sauces that it came with stole the show. They brought out the citrus gochujang, honey butter, and ginger sesame soy for us to try. These are all bursting with flavor, and the extra-crispy chicken wings paired well with them.Although UmMa may have some items that might not amaze you, items like the chicken wings are definitely a reason to check them out. The food there is on the pricier side too, although some items are still in an affordable range by SF standards.,Near the end of your meal you will want to leave because your butt hurts. Haha. For some reason, the picnic tables in the back patio are a height and hardness that is not ergonomic. Butt anyways, let me talk about the food.I like the Sul Lang Tang, butter chicken wings (just get the butter flavored because the other flavor is not as good), and bulgogi. One time I also tried the bibimbap which I thought was interesting because it was vegetarian and had a lot of vegetables and mushrooms in it. It's actually pretty good to pair this with an order of bulgogi!,Went here for a quick lunch and loved every second! Service was quick and food was very good. No complaints.,As a Korean I'm always on the lookout for good Korean food in the city! I've heard so many good things about um.ma so I was excited to try it! I think the restaurant itself is really nice. The front is very clean and modern but the outdoor back patio is spacious yet cozy giving almost like a camping in the woods kind of feel. The servers were also really nice and attentive! I didn't think that the food was anything extraordinary or amazing. Little disappointed on the prices esp for what you are getting back. If I'm paying $22 for seafood pancake I would hope I'm getting more seafood than pancake but alas that was not the case. This place is definitely not traditional Korean by any means and is more of an clean(?) version of kbbq. They only have 3 meats to select from and all three are marinated, you also have the pay extra for the ssam and veggies which is different from a lot of other kbbq places. This is definitely a cute date spot or a good place to drink with friends but if you want the experience of kbbq and filling up on various meats and side dishes, this might not be the place. Interested in coming back to try their bibimbaps and tofu soup!,I've wanted to come try Um Ma at the restaurant for so long, and I'm so thankful I finally did. I was able to make a reservation for Saturday night the day before. It didn't seem too crowded when we got there, but I'd definitely recommend making a reservation online if there's availability. I love both the interior and patio space here -- both are clean, aesthetic, and thoughtfully designed. My friend and I were able to get a seat at the patio. We shared Soju, and we ordered the Seafood Pancake, Soondubu Jjigae and the Bulgogi to share. All the dishes were delicious. The Seafood Pancake was crispy and came with a decent amount of seafood, while the Soondubu had a generous amount of pork belly in it. I do wish they gave more banchan options, but I did like the pickled cucumbers and quail eggs. The rice was also great -- really can't go wrong with Korea purple rice.Service is quick and food comes out quickly. This is definitely more expensive than your typical Korean spot, but I do think it's worth the spot. They know what they're doing!,I'd give the food alone 4 stars, but considering the service and ambiance, it's more of a 3 for me.As someone from Korean decent, I'd say come here if you want some good kfc (Korean fried chicken). If you want a traditional Korean meal, I'd go to Manna down the street.,A pleasantly surprised experience! To be honest I was a little bit skeptical of the restaurant since it was supposedly Korean food but it didn't seem / feel like it. However, the food was quite authentic! My favorite was actually the Selotang soup then the pancake then the fried chicken. Maybe I over expected fried chicken but it wasn't as good as chicken compared to BonChon. Shout out to the waitress who kindly gave us a big refill of the egg ban Chan.,Banchan (4/5): they served 4 side dishes. My favorites with the tea quail eggs and broccoli with sesame oil. The servings can be a  bit small but definitely feel free to ask for more Seafood Pancake (3/5): classic seafood pancake however it lacked on the seafoodHoney Butter KFC (4/5): crispy fried chicken with a unique honey butter sauce. I liked the pronounced honey taste in the sauce, but it can definitely be too sweet for some. The chicken wasn't dry but it wasn't juicy either Sul Lang Tang (4.5/5): my favorite of the night - super comforting and well seasoned. I wish they had gone with an alternative noodles since they overcooked very easily and became too soft LA style Galbi (3/5): the meat was tender and the marinade was tasty; however not sure if it stood enough for the 50 dollarsThere's a lot of seating at the restaurant both inside and at the patio. I'd recommend seating at the patio since nicer vibe and also not cold at all from the heat lamps. The restaurant is a bit understaffed so service at times was a bit slow.,I've been wanting to check this place out for a while! Walked in and dined inside, great service from the waiter who seemed to be handling a lot but with grace and a smile! The flavors were distinct-- different from other Korean spots, the chicken wings were good quality meat and very saucy, wasn't blown out of my seat or anything though. The kimchi fried rice was pretty good, done with purple rice, the kimchi jigsaw was my favorite by far. I took off a star because the charred gai lan was too charred, it was straight up burnt, just bad, so that was sad. I'd like to try this place again, the banchan was so good!,Was nearby and looking for a place to eat. I had dinner with my fiancé. We got there early around 5 on holiday so we were able to get seated but it seems like reservations might be good idea. Seems to be popular place. Here's what we ordered:Seafood pancake -4.5/5. The flavors were great. For me the pancakes was a little too thick. Could have used a little more seafood. I like they cut it up in a bunch of small. pieces so it's easier to eat. Dipping sauce was good tooKimchi fried rice-5/5. So good! Their kimchi is not super sour like other places. The purple rice adds more texture to dish. Also makes me feel a little healthier :) I do wish there was some spam or meat in there though. Pork belly-3.5/5. This is just my personal preference, I wasn't fond of the seasoning. I usually like pork belly with sesame oil, salt and pepper. Still good and cooked well. Overall, food is high quality and service was good even though it was busy. Prices pretty standard for Korean food. One of the few places where I like all the ban chan. Definitely worth a try!,Wonderful dining experience at Um Ma. We enjoyed our food, the atmosphere, and the kind service. We dined at the back patio with our pup and he got his water bowl when we sat down. We really enjoyed the kalbi. It was meaty, nicely marinated, and delicious. The chicken sandwich was okay. The banchan were good but very small selection. However banchan are refillable, so ask for more if you want more. The restaurant is very popular, so we don't go as often as we would like, but we definitely recommend.,Really great authentic tasting Korean food. We liked everything, but highlights included the dak galbi (Korean-style chicken stir fry), bone marrow, seafood pancake, and the wings (citrus gochujang and ginger sesame soy were the best sauces). Good beer selection, friendly service, and a variety of types of soju - will definitely be back to try other menu items.,absolutely delicious korean food!! some unique takes on traditional dishes, but i liked the twist - the purple kimchi rice and the chicken wings were a top for me! would love to come again with a bigger group and try out more of the meats,The food here is delicious. It is also expensive AF. We came for Korean BBQ and it was 50 bucks just for the meat. Veggies extra. No ban chan. Also got okonomiyaki and a few other sides, which were all delicious but I left hungry and broke.The space is cute. The service was not. We had a 6:30 reservation (totally recommend a reservation because the  last time we came we were told there were no available tables for the rest of the night, even though the restaurant was half empty). They said, oh we are just cleaning up the table, it will be a few minutes. 10 minutes later they brought us out back. The table was not that clean and the whole back was empty except for one other table. It was odd. They are either way understaffed or the staff is all new.After more of a wait, we put our order in and this girl who clearly had zero idea what she was doing tried to light the BBQ for a good ten minutes. A different and more competent girl came and gave us a different grill. We enjoyed our meal but the service was so bad, I am making it my mission to find a cheaper KBBQ place.,I had a reservation for this place and they seated us in the back. I didn't know or were we told it was going to be outdoor seating.  Come on, we are in SF, you could've said that so we can come properly dressed.   For our table, it was super sticky.  It's like someone took the korean chicken wings and and wiped it all over the table sticky.   From that point on, i had to question how the rest of my night was going to be.  We started with the Sul Lung Tang which was the bone marrow broth with beef brisket and noodles.  This was pretty good, as I think the soup help from sitting outside on a cold SF night.   The seafood pancakes was overcooked in my opinion.  I was very disappointed by this dish as i tasted more batter than ingredients.  We got the chicken wings in honey butter, ginger sesame and one i can't remember. There was nothing special about these as i felt the just drizzled sauce on and charged us for the sauces.  I don't get the hype from this.  I even think BonChon had better chicken wings.   The Bibibap was ok to me, we had to add extra for protein. This dish was ok to me, however, it was a really big dish, and we could not finish it.   It's great if you have 4 or more people to share this with.  overall, i didn't like my experience here.   Maybe if the table wasn't so sticky i would've have questioned how clean was this place.,Very cute restaurant but feels confusing. We made reservations for 2 to be seated in the patio. The patio seatings all have built in grills in case you wanted to do kbbq. We ordered the 10 piece KFC and Bone Broth soup. For starters, the fried chicken came out within 5 minutes of ordering and was cold. I sent this right back to the kitchen and they brought us freshly made ones. When freshly made, the chicken has a nice crunch to it, followed by the juiciness of the chicken. The wings and drumsticks are all of good sizes. The flavor was pretty good. In most Korean restaurants, the banchans are the first to arrive at the table. However, all our food came out and we had to ask the server for the banchan. Not sure if they don't bring this for all tables or it's only available if you order certain food items? Overall, the price is steep for what you get. It's a bit difficult to tell if it's suppose to be a home cooked meal vibe or an upscale Korean restaurant. Price is upscale, but the food and tastes you can find anywhere.,The outdoor area was pretty and cozy. Some heaters did not work, so try to get a spot next to a heater. But indoor seating is also available. The food was good, but not incredibly great. The staff were all so kind and helpful which is what gives this place a 4 star!,I've been to um.ma a few times and this time was no exception, the food was out extremely quickly and the bonchon and beers to boot were great! I got a mango Korean beer and my wife got a dalgona flavored beer and both were tasty (although I liked mine better haha). We sat in the outdoor back patio and there was PLENTY of space for both us as we came right around 5 pm. Rockin' Roe - 5/5 the yellow roe had this specific savory, fermented aftertaste that was strangely addictive, I kept going in for more!Kimchi Jjigae - 4/5 was a good kimchi soup but would've loved a bit more anchovy or savory mouthfeel, the overall soup was good but not the absolute best I've had!Next time I come back, I definitely have to try the kbbq!,Hostess was rude when we arrived the other day. Should have taken that as a sign to leave immediately. I also don't think restaurants need to charge 5 dollars for lettuce to go with bbq along with 3 dollars for sauce. I get inflation but this is nuts. Hard pass on spending 100 dollars on a sub par meal. Stars are for the kind waiter and space is decorated quite beautifully.,We were here sometimes during Covid when only outdoor dining was available. Since then, we always wanted to come.back to try the BBQ. First of all, they price went up 50%. It was $50 for 2 lbs but now you only get 1 lb. Lettus, greens and sauce all required extra dollars. They did got the back years redone with covers and more floor headlamps. We still went for the BBQ with the Korean short ribs. In addition, we also got the pancake and bimbibap. I still liked that they serve purple rice here. Service wise, it was a disappointed upon arrivals because no matter how many servers came out from the back, they were all too busy to make eye contact or any acknowledgement. Once we were seated, our server was better even though she was one of them that didn't make eye contact while we were waiting at the front. Our conclusion was that we would not do the stove top BBQ even when we come back next time because it would actually be cheaper to have the kitchen cook for us for less price. I will not likely take the time to make reservations in advance to visit this restaurant again though.,It's been a really hard to find a good Korean restaurant in SF; UMMA almost hit the spot!We put our name on the waiting list for umma and waited for about 30-45 minutes before they called us and informed us that our table was ready! I ordered the tofu soup and my sister ordered the rocking roe bowl and a side of seafood pancake. The soup was actually pretty spicy although I found the broth a bit lacking in the staple Korean tanginess that I was fond of. However, the food and sides overall were really good and filling!,Korean BBQ without leaving smelling like the meat you just consumed. The ribs and wings are divine.,I'm torn on this place, lots of good intentioned dishes but just weren't done right. The vibe was great but quality of the food couldn't keep up. - Fried chicken - The sauce was thick but the batter was thicker... Too much batter and too little frying time, the chicken wasn't crispy- Grilled fish - cooked too dry,Made reservation for wed night. Park let, indoor and back outdoor seating. We opt to sit in back patio. Heat lamp at every picnic table. Tables are perfectly space out. We ordered 10 Korean fried chicken and pick all three flavors. My personal favorite is ginger sesame soy and honey butter. Crispy and tasty. Citrus gochujang was good but I don't like  soggy texture. Kalbi falls right off the bone. Good balance of sweet and savory. Goes perfectly with purple rice. Seafood pancake ~ thick, crispy and chewy with good portion of seafood in every bite. Nice wait staff. Parking was bit hard to find but we went during prime time dinner. It's expect to park 1-2 block away.,I've had this bookmarked since I read about them in a foodie's blog.  We dropped in for lunch today arriving at 11:05am.  We were asked if we had a reservation.  No we don't have a reservation. This is so puzzling to me as they opened at 11am and it's Wednesday middle of the week.  We were led to the back outdoor patio.  First ones seated.  It's a cozy area.  Picnic tables and benches.  Heat lamps.  We QR'd the menu.  I'd read the previous reviews and already had an inkling of what to order.  Hubby & I shared: * 10 piece Korean fried chicken wings with three different sauces * kimchi fried rice with added pork belly* large bottle Kloud beerThe kimchi fried rice was brought to our table first & three different types of ban chan. Presentation was very pleasing to the eye.  The quail egg was poached.  Good amount of cut up pork belly throughout.  And just enough fire. The KFC came second.  Again great presentation.  Lovely glazes on all ten.  Having a sweet tooth I like the honey butter glaze ones best.  We had a Kloud with our meal.  It was a perfect pairing.  The server refilled our barley tea and asked how everything was.  We paid via an online platform.  In & out within an hour.  Just as well as my bottom was becoming stiff.  I'd like to return and try some other dishes.,I've heard great things from friends about Um Ma SF and was finally able to try this place out the other week! Overall, I had a positive experience: Pros:-It's very easy to make reservations through their website online-The interior gives off a very warm, homey modern vibe-A nice variety of menu items to choose from. Food was great; I really enjoyed the kogi and sul lung tang here. -Surprisingly, I LOVED their beer selection. I love how they serve beer from Dokkaebier, a loca",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Bay Area brewery. I got the mango ale and my friend's boyfriend ordered the yuzu ale. Cons: -ONLY patio dining available. Depending on the day and the weather, it might not be enjoyable to eat outdoors.-Parking is an absolute nightmare. Expect to spend 10-30 minutes looking for parking.,Gorgeous interior and overall presentation. We put our name on the waitlist and was called to be seated around 40 minutes later. We were seated inside, but they have outdoor tables as well. Our party ordered the spicy pork, kimchi fried rice, and the Korean fried chicken. Out of the dishes, I liked the spicy pork the best and it tasted really good with their purple rice! We asked for gloves to eat the chicken and our server was nice to accommodate for us. The food was good, but it was a bit on the expensive side. Our total bill for a party of 3 came out to almost $90. Also, there's only one bathroom, so there was a line of 5-6 people waiting to use it. With this knowledge, plan your bathroom visits accordingly!,The interior is spacious, clean and modern. I haven't gotten the chance to be seated outdoor cause it's always packed so make sure you get reservation. The portion is massive for one person. I often see people sharing an entree. The banchan (appetizers) weren't bad but it did taste different compared to the ones served at the Korean mom-and-pop shop. The kimchi was pretty sour and soggy. The pickled cucumber tasted more like sauerkraut. The steamed broccoli was good but it didn't have the authentic sesame flavor that I was used to. Also every rice entree is made with purple rice, including the kimchi fried rice! It's super unique and delicious. Bibimbab came in a hot stone pot and it was sooooo good!!!!! The rice was crispy at the bottom and the vegetables were cooked perfectly. After adding the sauce, you could easily finish the whole thing! Rockin Roe is made with fresh fish eggs. If you like eating flavored fish eggs with rice, check this out!,Great service, tasty food and great ambiance, that sums it up! Everything on the menu is great. Very clean place and nice and cozy backyard, what else would one ask for.,Made reservations for dinner at 6:45pm on a Saturday and was seated promptly in the back patio. Space was well insulated and didn't feel the cold & fog, a major plus for outdoor seating. Drink: Ordered a bottle of the apple mango soju. Definitely on the sweet side, would recommend cutting this with some bubbly water. Food: First dish out was the stir fried gai lan with mushrooms, this was super flavorful. A bit too salty on its own, would pair with a rice dish to balance the saltines but still an enjoyable side veggie. Banchan: there were 4 types, pickled cucumber, quail eggs, kimchi and broccoli all were good nothing too noteworthy. Vegetable Bibimbop: this came out hot and sizzling, with tons of veggies like carrots, corn, zucchini, purple cabbage. Topped with a soft oozy egg, this definitely hit the spot. Soondubu jjigae: large chunks of silken tofu in a not too spicy kimchi broth with mushrooms and other veggies. Really great on a cool night. Flavors were balenced, this complimented the bibimbop well.Service was quick and efficient, no complaints. Menu is through a QR code but orders are placed with servers. Overall, nice spot for Korean classics, great patio space, nothing noteworthy but a solid spot if you are in the inner sunset looking for Korean food.,I think the aesthetic and modern feel of this restaurant are definitely some of its better features. The outdoor patio was super cute with strung lights and heat lamps around picnic tables. I also thought that the fact that they offered custom payment splits directly within their payment app was also pretty unique and worth highlighting!However, in every other aspect (variety of KBBQ meats and banchan, price, service, etc,), there is definitely room for improvement. Unlike more traditional KBBQ restaurants, the only meats available were Kalbi, bulgogi, and pork belly. I was also surprised that sauces ($3 each) and ssam ($5) were an additional cost. The most frustrating part of my experience was the service. Although our servers were friendly and kind, it took forever for us to get anything we asked for even when there were fewer parties eating later in the evening. We would ask for certain banchan and water refills and receive maybe half of what we asked for, so we would frequently repeat the dishes that were missed. There were also inconvenient shortages - they ran out of scissors completely to cut the kalbi, and their grills were backed up to get washed at on point. We had to use a completely blackened grill until we could finally get a clean grill. The heat lamp next to us also randomly stopped working and it took at least 10 minutes to flag a server down to come turn it on.,came here with a group of 12, and i would say the service and food were all pretty good! i like how they give you the option to grill the meat yourself or order it already cooked! i would def come here again! cant remember everything we ordered but here are some recs - * pork belly - this dish stood out the most imo! so good! i would definitely get this again* korean fried chicken * kimchi fried chicken - came with purple rice * kalbi * seafood pancake * tofu soup,Delicious wholesome Korean food near golden gate park! Came for an early dinner over the weekend and was seated v quickly! They have cute outdoor seating which was open and airy.We had to get the Korean fried chicken and we got the soy garlic glaze which were SUBLIME! They were crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside and the glaze was sweet, sticky and had a bit of a kick. Absolutely 10/10We also got the bibimbap and the kimchi fried rice. They were both v tasty and flavorful and the vegetables in both were cooked really well! The kimchi fried rice in particular was so unique with wild rice and the poached eggs in both dishes were perfect and runny and calmed the spice from the main dish. Super balanced and well planned dishes. Would definitely come back again!,This place has the most adorable back patio seating area and very friendly service.  There was a lot I wanted to try, but ended up trying the following:1. Kimchi fried rice with bulgogi: Generous amounts of meat with a perfect soft boiled egg on top.  I wished it was more kimchi heavy though, I could barely taste it.2. Korean fried chicken wings: We got all three flavors: ginger sesame soy, honey butter, citrus gochujang.  They were all very different so I recommend trying all of them.  Though the ginger sesame soy was the most familiar in taste, I enjoyed the honey butter best! Very crispy and crunchy.It comes with 4 banchan dishes. I'd like to come back and try more dishes to do a proper evaluation of the variety of menu items! Parking is challenging in this area, so make sure to leave room in your schedule to park.,Um Ma is definitely not a traditional style Korean restaurant. It has a modern trendy, and really cool vibe which you'd see in more modern restaurants but I thought was really alluring. They have a huge backyard patio which they use for seating surrounded by trees and plants. I was excited to try Um Ma because I had heard it was one of the hot new restaurants in SF. - Seafood Pancake ($19)- LA Style Kalbi ($34)- Pork Belly ($22)- Korean Fried Chicken Wings ($19)- Charred Gai Lan ($11)Overall, the food was good. But I do think the pricing on some of the items were a bit extreme, as nothing truly wow'd me. Our favorite dish was the seafood pancake which came with shrimp, scallop, scallions, imitation crab, and a seasoned soy dip. The dip was really good and the texture and flavors of he pancake were fresh I also enjoyed the chicken wings. There are 3 flavor options - citrus gochujang, honey butter, ginger sesame soy - and the order consists of 10 pieces which you can select which, or all, the sauces. The meat was tender and the sauces were flavorful.From a price perspective, the kalbi and pork belly did shock me a bit. The kalbi had a lot of meat on the bone with good flavoring, but I did not think it was valued at $34. This is easily protein pricing at a Michelin Star. I did enjoy the gai lan but I wish it had come with more king oyster mushroom.,Damn lil ladies," you sure can put it away!!!"""" was probably what our waiter was thinking when we put in this order if they watch TikToks LOL. Split family-style between 3 people", we ordered the kimchi fried rice, kimchi scallion pancake, korean fried chicken, kalbi, pork belly, and bulgogi. The meats and pancake were good, but star of the meal was definitely the kimchi fried rice. Every bite was so flavorful and buttery, the rice was a great chewy texture, and the egg was perfectly poached. I've had my fair share of kimchi fried rice and THIS definitely stands out in a good way. I'd recommend coming here just to try their kimchi fried rice. From first glance, you might think the restaurant has no/little customers, but take a closer look and you'll see that they're all in the back. I really love their outdoor dining set-up and am impressed at how spacious it feels! Irving can be a busy street, so being in the back also means more privacy to eat and talk. The decor is super modern and trendy (think a wall of fake greenery for the perfect backdrop for photos), so if you like aesthetics, this is your place! We didn't use the grill, but if you do come here for that, it also means your clothes and hair won't be as stinky since it's outdoors!!Overall, 4 stars because for the slightly higher price point than other restaurants in this neighborhood, only the kimchi fried rice truly wow'd me. Great service, good food, amazing fried rice, and cute interior decor!Come and indulge yourself in this delicious kimchi fried rice and then take a walk at Golden Gate Park next door to walk it all off!,"We came here for a birthday celebration dinner for my two kids.   I had high expectations of this place and was disappointed.  The special """"room"""" that we reserved was basically a section of the restaurant that is in between the main dining room and the back BBQ area", right next to the bathroom.  The back door was left open for the servers to go in and out of but in the meantime we go cold from the opening. Service was not good.  It took a while for anyone to come by.   We finally had to flag someone down to take our order.  The banchon was minimal consisting of 4 quail eggs, a small sauce dish of kimchi, and a small sauce dish of a couple of slices of cucumbers and preserved daikon.  This was supposed to be for 7 people.  The food itself was decent.  We had to ask for rice even though it was supposed to come with our meal.  We asked for some lettuce to eat with our pork belly.  Well, the lettuce didn't come till after we were finished with the pork belly.  And found out later that we were charged for the lettuce.  I had called prior to arriving that I would be bringing a cake and was told there would be a $15 cake fee.  I said ok.   When we were ready I asked them to bring out the cake.  The server brought our cake out in the box and left.   No plates, utensils, candles, or cake cutter.  Everyone at the table was like ok what are we supposed to do with that.  Finally another server saw our perplexed looks and came and ask if we wanted them to serve it.  Ok, why else would I be charged a $15 fee then?I don't mind paying the price for good service and good food.  But for this place the service was definitely not worth and the food was definitely not above average.,Finally got to try Um Ma on a busy Saturday for lunch. I would definitely recommend making a reservation as the wait time can be quite lengthy for walk ins. Overall, my fiancé and j really enjoyed our meal despite a little mishap. The staff are accommodating and doing their best to keep up with the demands. You can definitely tell they can benefit from more assistance, but there's a staffing shortage everywhere. We ordered 3 items to share: the rocking fish/flying fish (?) rice bowl, a seafood pancake, and an assortment of their wings. I loved loved the fish roe rice bowl with the various flavors and purple rice. Definitely an eye pleaser and tastebuds were happy as well. For the price, I'm not mad with the amount of fish roe on the plate. The only bummer was finding a large piece of hard plastic in our dish--likely from packaging that was super unpleasantly and potentially dangerous if swallowed. We told our waitress and she was quick to offer a replacement dish and give us a discount. The seafood pancake was different and way crispier than others I'm more use to. Although it's smaller, my fiancé was pleasantly surprised by the amount of seafood packed into the little pie. I was super happy with the extra crispy crust as other places end up making their pancakes too soggy. Last but not least, we shared the 10 piece chicken wings. I can't say I have a favor flavor, but I will say the batter was awesome and super crunchy--jus glow I prefer. Sauces were a tad on the sweeter side, but nothing overwhelming. I do see that there are things they need to work on, but the quality of the items definitely do show through on the chosen ingredients.  We didn't do the bbq, but lots of folks outside chose a platter of meats doe their table.,Great service with delicious food and cute patio seating!I got their sullungtang and the broth was very tasty. The brisket was tender and the somen noodles were a good texture. My friend got the honey butter chicken wings which smelled like a cinnamon roll. He let me try a piece and it was very delicious too! When my other friend went to the restroom, I stole one of her bulgogi that she added on her bibimbap. I hope she doesn't see this review... but that bulgogi was really good!!Anyways, I really enjoyed the food so I'll be back to try more. On our way out, all the servers said bye including one of them who was on a break. Such sweet service!,I never miss a chance to stop by here when in town for work. I should probably try more from the menu but I have to have the kimchi fried rice so it's hard to miss out on that my trying something new. I've been here four different times and the food is consistently fantastic!,I LOVE umma. Hands down the best bibimbap in town- love the purple rice!! I did go on a Monday, and they were out of a bunch of vegetarian options, which was unfortunate though.,"Ooooh Ma... actually it's Um Ma in Korean which was explained to me as """"Mom"""" or """"OMG"""""," so I guess my """"Ooooh Ma"""" combines the two!This modern take on Korean food is about six blocks away from my Um-Ma-In-Law's flat and we only recently ventured here due to the various Yelp suggestions.  Yes", I rely on my fellow Yelper's reviews!Parking can be a challenge in the Inner Sunset, especially near GGP but lunch parking was a breeze.We were promptly seated at a wooden picnic-like table in the back patio section.  A heat lamp was lit for us on a cold January day.  The polite waitress guided us thru the menu resulting in us eating:- Banchan of Kimchee, Fish Cake, Soy Quail Eggs, and Broccoli (liked the unique Soy Quail Eggs the most)- Seafood Pancake:  full of shrimp, scallops, squid rings, etc with a dipping sauce (version is thicker than most others as it is chock full of seafood)- Mesquite Grilled BBQ Pork Belly (liked this smokey version a lot)- Sullungtang Beef bone marrow Broth Ramen Noodles and Brisket (nice and hot for a cold winter day - check out the steam rising out of the noodles in my pic)- Chicken Wings with choice of three sauces, we chose the honey and the soy based sauces (had better elsewhere - the honey based one was a bit too sweet)Overall, a worthy addition to the Inner Sunset dining scene.  Will definitely return.,The low resolution printouts on the wall say it all. The food may look Korean, but it's fake and not very good. Nothing stood out as tasty. Soon du bu was missing something. The bulgogi was overly sweet. I recommend the restaurant get a new cook and especially someone more than just familiar with Korean food. Staff was friendly and attentive.,Pleasantly surprised by our meal at Um Ma. If we come back, I'm definitely going right for the bibimbap. This bowl was packed with veg and meat and still very affordable. The rice was perfectly charred at the bottom (heat warning - everything at this restaurant stays incredibly hot so give it some time before you take a big bite). I would skip the charred gai lan as the char made the greens, which I normally love, too bitter. The KFC was crispy and moist, but not the best we've had. Banchan game? Wish we had more variety. 3.5 stars.,"Um.ma has been on my SF to-go list ever since I heard they received a bib gourmand. The food was just a good as I expect (with a price tag that also matched my expectations). FYI they only offer outdoor seating in a cozy patio around the back of the restaurant with picnic style tables and heaters. The show stopper of the meal was definitely the rocking roe bowl. Bibimbap roughly translates to """"mixed rice bowl"""". Once you mix all the beautiful roe gems into the purple rice", you get a delectable bowl of intensely seafood-y rice with pops of ikura and crunchy tobiko. It is a luxurious dish for sure, but very delicious for a simple dish. I especially loved the banchan, or complimentary side dishes, like the marinated quail eggs and freshly made kimchi. The wings had the classic Korean double fry, thus maintaining a good crunch when soaked in their sauces - soy, gochujang, and honey butter. I really enjoyed the variety and would recommend you try all the sauces to find your favorite as well! The seafood pajeon was packed with tender seafood and super crispy. Some of the food I would skip next time. The mackerel was a bit charred for me, but really delicious underneath the skin. The pork belly was also just ok, I think we would have preferred to grill our own meat over the pre-cooked plate. The tofu soup was nothing to write home about. The gai lan was too salty, but the mushrooms sautéed with it made it really delicious. We left with full bellies and six boxes of leftovers. Overall, I really enjoyed the experience and would love to come back for grilling meats there. The price tag is easier to justify when someone else is paying, but I can see treating myself to the rocking roll bowl in the future as well!,Went here for our anniversary dinner and all the food was delicious!! We got the honey butter wings and they had a nice crunch, just like regular Korean fried chicken places, just a little bit smaller. The Sul Lung Tang was honestly one of the best broths I've had 5/5. It went well with the Kalbi, which were nice and tender. The kimchi fried rice was spicy and had a nice runny yolk on top. We also got one bowl of purple rice to split which was the perfect amount for two of us. Would highly recommend as a delicious Korean choice in Inner Sunset. There's not that much space inside so we sat on their back patio and they had nice heaters since it was a bit chilly when we went. Servers were very friendly and you can definitely ask for more banchan!,Mediocre, EXTREMELY overpriced food, and negligent service. There are so many Korean restaurants in the city, it really isn't worth taking the risk on the prices here when the dishes are so bland and lacking. Not just this, but the workers paid no attention to my table and it was to the point I had to get up and hand my check to the worker just to pay for my meal. They brought us the wrong dish, charged us for a drink that was ordered but never brought to our table, and made our table have to call multiple times for a waitress just to come over since they would come to assist other tables and then completely turn their back on our table when walking back to the front. Again, not a recommended place for Korean food given all the better options for far cheaper. $80 for bibimbap, chicken wings, and corn cheese is unbelievable.,After a nice stroll through the park nothing beats Korean BBQ. Sizzling hot meats, fresh greens and pickles veggies. Yummy food and cute environment. Staff was kinda, for lack of a better word clueless. But whatever. We still got the job done. Don't get the barley tea! Straight up tasted like nothing in a bad way. Wasn't hot at all. Barely even warm. Reminded me of bathwater that's been just hanging out for 2 hours.,I ordered from Um Ma a couple times before and their fried chicken and salmon roe rice dishes are pretty good. I'd give them a 4/5 on those dishes.HOWEVER, I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO MAKE A REVIEW  FOR THEIR TABLE TOP GRILL (so you don't make the same mistake as me) Recently, we came to dine in for the first time here and decided to get their kbbq! You can order meat from their mesquite grill section and it might be more worth it but if you want to grill the meat by yourself, it's $60 per plate of meat (1lb) or $100 for 2lbs of meat WHICH IS CRAZY EXPENSIVEEEEEE. IDK WHY WE DECIDED TO PAY THAT, but we did and now you don't have to (: BECAUSE IT IS NOT WORTH IT. The meat quality did not taste high grade, but rather disappointing and 2 lbs of meat may sound like a lot, but it really isn't (photo posted). Honestly, the bulgogi marinade was too sweet and the pork belly tasted like pork belly from AYCE places. I don't know how they justify their table top grill prices because even SAN HO WON that is an upscale kbbq spot in SF doesn't even charge that much. If you do come, order anything but the table top grill section!! Don't make the same mistake I made. They should just take off the table top grill section in my opinion.,No dinner reservation on a weekday. Sat in the front with no grill. Not a problem, I wasnt going to order any grill items anyway. Service was like what others had mentioned: the servers were busy but their manager (wearing a flannel shirt) was really nonchalant to the point that I didn't even knew he worked there. Once the dinner rush left, the service was great.Banchan arrived with the food. Weird not getting this BEFORE the food. 4 small dishes: soybeans, broccoli, pickled cucumbers, pickled radish. No kimchi. NO KIMCHI? I've never heard of that coming out of a Korean restaurant. I'm not sure if they had a kimchi shortage.Kalbi was mediocre.Get the Seolleongtang. Creamy. Rich. I would rather have this than tonkatsu ramen broth. I would definitely order this again but I would ask for the noodles separate because near the end, the noodles got kinda mushy. No green onions or salt on the side (soup has been seasoned already). The meat in the soup was SOOO soft. This is the only reason this place isnt 2 to 3 stars.I dont understand the hype of this place. I feel I missed its glory days or something. Thank goodness that Seolleongtang broth was STELLAR.,Have been to Um Ma on multiple occasions and am now finally writing a review.Items are family style so they are all shareable. They are available for both dine in and take out. Seating is pretty spacious as they not only have indoor seating but they have a back patio that's great for groups. Recommended items: - seafood pancake - great presentation and love the crispy edges but still soft center of a typical savory pancake. - sul lung tang - I can't handle too much spice so this soup is perfect as it's filling and delicious on a cold day - pork belly - do I really need to explain good pork belly? Price is pretty decent especially since these are shareable plates. This place is probably one of the best, affordable Korean restaurants in the city.,TL;DR - Truly a 3.5 but rounding up to 4. The backyard patio was spectacular, food was comforting. The menu was surprisingly limited compared to what I expected, leaning towards traditional meals. The banchan - side dishes - offered included: kim chi, pickled broccoli, pickled bean sprouts, and pickled raddish/cucumber. We ordered:- bibimbap with bulgogi (you can choose bulgogi or pork belly): We both felt that this was not saucy enough, even though we used all of the sauce that they gave us too. They use purple rice and there's spear cuts of cucumber and other veggies.- bone broth soup with brisket: this was so soulful. If you love pho, you will love this because it's extremely clean, salty without being over salted, brisket was a good amount, and overall could be shared with 1 other person. I highly recommend,- scallion pancake: it seems deep fried! really interesting! Not my favorite I've ever had, but my husband loved it.- charred gai lon: highly recommended, extremely flavorful and will go great with rice.The space was great overall.,Loved how cute and clean this place was! Stopped by for lunch and got seated in the back with our dog. They have bbq grills on some of the tables which was great for cooking your own. We did the seafood pancake, Korean bbq and soondobu. Everything was really good and it came with lots of side dishes as well,I had an overall good time here. Place is super cute inside and has on outdoor patio where they sat everyone. Their patio also had heaters to keep their guests warm, which is always lovely to have. Food was great! We ordered the kimchi pancake, Bibimbap, and the dry rub chicken wings. Kimchi pancake was super yummy! I would definitely order it again. They were very generous with the scallions on top, which we enjoyed. The bibimbap was also yummy. The waitress suggested we add bulgogi which I thought was a great recommendation. It was very yummy and had a lot of rice for 4 people! Lastly, the chicken wings were good and crispy. I was ok at with the dry rub so would recommend trying the other sauces. Overall, really great service and would recommend trying it out!,One of our friends made a reservation here for us to have lunch, with indoor seating. I arrived about 10mins late due to lack of available parking in the area, but it turned out that the other half of our 8-person party was even later than I was. The host was visibly annoyed, and continued to ask us when the rest of our party would show up. While somewhat understandable, it was also rather perplexing, as the rest of the indoor dining tables remained completely empty during our entire dining experience. So a lack of space for other potential patrons certainly wasn't an issue.Despite the hiccup with our party arriving late, and the frustrated host who seated us, our actual waitress was very friendly and efficient. And along with knowing the menu very well, made sure to check in on us multiple times throughout our meal.As we were eight, very hungry guys, we ordered a plethora of apps and entrees to share. These included, but were not limited to: Korean fried chicken, Un Ma house wings, seafood pancake, kimchi fried rice, bulgogi, and pork belly. Although all of the food was really good, the bulgogi and Un Ma house wings were definitely the agreeable highlights on the table.Although the inside decor is very clean and modern, we noticed that most patrons preferred to do the covered, outdoor seating, located at the back of the establishment.,Food was really great but service was meh. Second time eating at Um Ma and it was quite different. The first time I came here, we made reservations for patio seating and had really great service. This time, we came as walk-ins and we're seated in the front, which I assume is the walk-in seating area. The service was really subpar, it seemed like the servers were busy and couldn't find time to help us take our order. We ordered the rockin roe, seafood pancake, and sullungtang. Rockin roe was pretty good! It was really interesting how you'll have a crunch with every bite you take. The savory flavor of the roe paired really well with the sweetness of the ginger and seaweed salad. The seafood pancake was also pretty good, tasted pretty standard like other places. The sullungtang was my favorite dish. The noodles were a bit mushy and overcooked, but the flavor of the soup was really fantastic. It was very rich and decadent, and the meat that came in it was very soft and tender. The banchan was also pretty good, but it was a small selection. We actually got the banchan after all the food came, so it was a little disappointing.,Made a reservation for 11am lunch on Sunday of MLK weekend. We were seated immediately in the spacious and well heated outdoor dining area. The tables filled up quickly from 11-12 for lunch. Even though the restaurant was clearly understaffed, our server was very knowledgeable, fast, and nice.Recommendations- Kimchi fried rice - Our server recommended adding bulgogi, which was definitely the right call. The flavors were rich and nuanced. Bulgogi was delicious, and egg was perfectly poached- Pork belly - So tender and well-seasoned. Not very fatty, but that didn't detract from the experienceMeh- Chicken wings - we ordered the All flavors option to try a little of everything. All three flavors (citrus gochujang, ginger sesame, soy honey butter) were underwhelming, and the chicken wings didn't have much meat. Would skip- Charred gai lon (Chinese broccoli) - nice dish to add some vegetables to a protein and carb-heavy meal, but nothing special- Braised potato - would skip. Addition of cheese added a nice dimension to the dish, but would save the room in your stomach for other dishesWe only got 3 banchan dishes, whereas the tables that came later got 5+ (including the popular quail eggs). Seemed rather odd, but oh well Overall, would definitely come back when I'm craving Korean food,Had birthday dinner here on a Saturday night in Sept for  party of 4.Service: 4 star. The hostess and servers were great, knowledgeable about the menu," in particular we learned that the amount of meat in BBQ section was the same as the """"Kogi"""" section only that you grill it yourself at the table.Food: 2 starMaybe it was an off-day but a majority of the dishes we ordered (except for the fried chicken) had something wrong with it. -The seafood pancake had wonderful crispy edges but the center gave a mealy taste like it was undercooked. -fried chicken 6 pc with soy ginger sauce was perfect-bibimbap surprised us with purple rice and a mix of seasonal veggies ( like zucchini/ carrot) instead of what I would say was the standard of spinach", carrot, mushroom, & mung bean sprouts. This was the worst dish because there was NO crispy rice at the bottom on the bowl and the veggies oozed liquid making the whole thing a wet mess.-Galbi which were cooked by the kitchen. Flavorful, tender, wish there was more.,It's our 4th or 5th time here. I do like the food but really don't find the staff to be friendly. No one smiles and no one enjoys their job. We arrived with reservations to find the host at the door rather dismissive. Told us he'd be right with us, then greeted a girl who walked in after us that the staff all seem to know and chatted a long time with her instead of seating us. When our order was taken, the person just walks up and asks, are you ready?  We had to ask for refill on the water twice because no one pays attention that the bottle is empty even though we purposely put it on the edge of the table hoping someone would pay attention as they walk by.  The food is good but the staff which all look like bored college students except for the one older gentleman who brought some of the food to our table, and was by far, the friendliest of the workers. One spent a lot of time standing by the sodas not doing much.  We ordered the delicious chicken wings with half half of honey and soy combinations.  Not to be missed. The pork belly was good too. The scallion pancake seemed to have tasted better before. Sadly, the soft tofu soup came last when it should've been first.  It was so spicy, 2 of us could not consume more than a bowlful. The wait staff who took our order didn't warn us as to how spicy it was and we forgot to ask for it to be mild. There is a health surcharge. Other places I've been to where there is a mandatory health surcharge, the staff seem nicer because they get benefits paid by the customer but the staff here don't appreciate that on top of the tip. I'll have to rethink about a return trip even if I like the food as I've never felt the staff to be welcoming in all the times we've dined here.,Service was probably the best part (and we also liked the back patio), but couldn't save other aspects of our dining experience. The tofu soup was salty, the pork belly was slightly over cooked and a little dry, and the kimchee and cucumbers had way too much vinegar.,Still very much enjoy the food here. Their outdoor seating is also nice especially with the heat lamps. Since the last time I've been, they're added grills and KBBQ options.,I've been waiting to come here for the longest time and am so glad I tried it. This restaurant is located in a very central location around other great eats (i.e Tartine, Fiorella, and more!)The patio outside is quite cute and the servers are very eager to help you! I tried the Sul Lung Tang and Charred Gai Lon and they were both delicious. The Sul Lung Tang also came with purple rice and the staff was super nice to bring two full bowls of rice because I was sharing this with a friend. The Charred Gai Lon was a little on the salty side but the flavors were 10/10. The Sul Lung Tang broth was a wholesome delicious milky broth that came with noodles. Honestly, the noodles were very meh but I could drink two bowls of that broth- it's that good!If you're looking for some cozy korean food, this place is it! It's a little on the pricey side but that's the nature of restaurants in SF. I would say for the two items I tried, the price was the kind of expensive that was still worthwhile.,Came by around 4:45 pm for an early dinner on a Sunday. They had us wait  about 20 minutes even though there were open tables because they were understaffed, which I understand.We all ordered the kimchi fried rice. It comes with purple rice, which I thought was different and quite pretty! Although I enjoyed the firmness of the purple rice and the runny poached egg, I felt that the whole dish lacked flavor. It was a bit one-dimensional, even though the textures were all there. This may have been because I didn't add a protein (it doesn't come with it), but I think the dish should've have more depth on its own. Willing to give it another try though.My favorite part of the meal was the quail eggs from the side dishes. The yolk was super flavorful and I haven't had one that compares. SO good.,This was the worst Korean food I've had in Bay Area!!! The bibimbap was the worst... why is there zucchini and corn and why did it absolutely not taste like bibimbap should? The ban chan were meager, the seollongtang noodles were over cooked and the soup tasted like it came from the ready-to-eat  section of HMart, and the fried chicken was on the dry side with the sauce tasting SO meh. The food was expensive and inauthentic... but good thing the interior is insta-worthy?? TLDR, incredibly Americanized Korean place that just baits people in with aesthetic insta worthy pictures.,This is of the worse Korean food I've ever had.  The service was even worse.  Our server never came and checked on us, forgot half the things we ordered, closed the kitchen and never brought it even though we asked multiple times - we had to flag down staff because no one came voluntarily.  To be clear we were NOT seated near last call, we had a reservation over 2 hours before closing.,We made lunch reservations for their very cool patio in the back.  Although they ask you to QR code their menu, I would have preferred a paper menu option.  My lunch bibimbab was quite disappointing since it wasn't authentic.  This is the first time I ever had a stone bowl not hot enough to make a rice crust on the bottom!  That was very disappointing.  Although the portion was large, the dish lacked many other ingredients typically found such as shiitake mushrooms and beansprouts.  I may try the fried chicken next time but I'd definitely skip this $23 bibimbab.,What a great spot! My family is still trying to outdoor dine as much as possible and this is a wonderful heated and covered patio. I forgot to take photos of the patio but other Yelp reviews have some great shots!Food: I also forgot to take photos of all the food, but it was all amazing! The pancake was the winner for all of us, so crispy and delicious. I loved the Rockin' Roe bowl, very flavorful roe and their rice is great. We also got the bulgogi and LA style kolbi (not photoed). Both were very good but the bulgogi was my favorite, so flavorful and tender!! The bibimap was also great, nice veggies, loved the mushrooms! Also - I really liked the corn tea, and it's free!Very friendly staff and great food, perfect for a cold night in San Francisco,Um.ma is what you would expect for a trendy SF spot serving Korean- smaller portions, higher price tag, cute plating. And shoot, they delivered on all three. And I can't speak of the authenticity of the food, but it seemed like a modern take on classics and most importantly, it was tasty. For just two, we ordered quite a lot, but we wanted to try a lot of different things. We had the seafood pancake, veggie bibimbap, grilled pork belly, and chicken wings (we tried all 3 flavors). Plus the food comes with banchan (marinated quail eggs are my favorite and this is the first restaurant I've been to that serves this) and purple rice. Everything was delicious, but my favorite was the grilled pork belly. It was juicy and tender, but not overly fatty. It was served with some sliced plum which served as a great palate cleanser. At the end of dinner, we were stuffed and had enough leftovers for 3 meals. Even our server said she though we ordered way too much but she liked our style (and she was great too). No complaints!,I love love love Korean food and this place has been on my list to try for a while now. I am so glad I finally got to try this yesterday night with my girlfriends. There were 7 of us, so we got to try a good variety of dishes :p Everything we ordered was so yummy! I kinda had set expectations that it would be good, but it was better than I expected!The interior and also their outdoor patio seating is so cute. I love the ambiance and the art on the wall. There's a smaller seating area in the front for smaller groups, larger tables towards the back and a cute decently sized outdoor patio seating with heat lamps. We sat on the inside right next to the outdoor patio seating and it felt very cozy.We ordered:- Bibimbap $19 which came in a hot stone pot. It had a bulgogi beef with lots of veggies and purple rice. Sauce on the side was a mild/medium spice and it tasted so yummy all mixed together- Rockin' Roe $26 which was a beautiful bowl with different types of fish roe with rice underneath to mix it all up. So unique and so good. Loved the crunch of all the roe :p- Sullungtang soup $19 this was one of my favorites because it was so light but so creamy and flavorful. The brisket was tender.- LA Style Kalbi $40 this didn't come with many pieces for the price point, but I love kalbi so I can't not order it if it's on the menu.. lol. It was a solid kalbi but like your standard kalbi dish!- Mackeral $26 this dish may have been my least fave, but it was also a solid dish. Nothing too memorable about it but if you like mackeral, it's worth ordering- 10pc korean fried chicken wings $19 - we were able to get all 3 flavors but I only tried ginger sesame soy and that was a flavorful one! Not spicy at all. - Seafood pancake $22 this is one of my fave korean pancakes I've tried because I like the crunchy batter. It's thicker than your usual korean pancake but I personally liked it if you don't mind the slightly thicker crunchy pancake- Charred gai lan $13 I really enjoyed this dish because I usually eat this veggie as a Chinese food dish but this one was stir fried and seasoned to perfection and I love the addition of the oyster mushroom!They also have beer," wine and soju. They have a table top kbbq menu which I wanna try next! I'd def come back again to try more things and order some of the same dishes :p Oh and their quail eggs which I believe is a """"banchan"""" side dish was so tasty! Loved it :)",Yummy food and great outdoor seating!I loved the outdoor patio of this place, it made me feel like I was having an intimate dinner in a friend's backyard. The ambiance was a mix of casual Korean dive bar and trendy Californian restaurant. I loved the mackerel and the pork belly dishes, they were both flavorful! The mackerel had the bones removed which I really appreciated as getting pricked by fish bones is the absolute worst. The seafood pancake was meh - it was not very crisp and didn't have a lot of seafood. I felt like the pancake was mostly batter and was a bit on the greasy side. It was also extremely salty.,Um Ma -- For Mom! Brought my mama and auntie here for a little midday lunch. The outdoor patio in the back is so cute and thank goodness they had heat lamps!We ordered the Seafood Pancake, Kimchi Fried Rice with Bulgogi, Pork Belly, Rockin' Roe, and Korean Fried Chicken with all three flavors. My favorites were the Seafood Pancake and Kimchi Fried Rice with Bulgogi. I definitely ordered the Rockin' Roe because I thought it was pretty, hahaha. But keep in mind it comes with rice underneath! The chicken wings were a bit dry but the flavors were great and made up for it.,I loved the fish roe rice bowl with the various flavors and purple rice. Definitely, an eye-pleaser and my taste buds were happy as well. The price is pretty decent especially since these are shareable plates. This place is probably one of the best, most affordable Korean restaurants in the city.,Our group of 4 had a Sunday night reservation and waited for about 10 minutes before being seated in the back patio. It was a little dark and chilly when we first arrived, but it became pretty cozy after the string lights and heat lamps turned on for the night. We went overboard with ordering chicken wings (assorted citrus gochujang, honey butter, ginger sesame soy), seafood pancake, soondubu jjigae, kimchi jjigae, bibimbap, and pork belly. The pancake and bibimbap were solid staples. But holy cow - the soups were spicy!! Normally I love the deep umami flavor that comes with soondubu jjigae but here it was hard to focus on anything other than my mouth on fire. Our server was also not around too much, so we did not get our water refilled and had to physically flag someone down for the check.,Um.ma was just nominated for a bib gourmand, and I've heard tons of great things about it from friends so I definitely wanted to give it a try. They have such a cute outdoor patio space (make sure to make a reservation beforehand to sit there, my friend and I weren't able to sit there as they told us it's reservation only) and it's perfect for dates or group meals. The galbitang was amazing and the most comforting soup on a cold day. However, the other dishes we ordered, pork belly and kimchi pancake, were just alright. I'd definitely skip those next time. Had high hopes for the pork belly as it is their signature dish but it was a bit dry and felt over sauced.Overall, pretty cute spot in Inner Sunset - can't go wrong with the soups!,"This place is good for groups and it's dog-friendly so that's a plus. It's been on my """"need to try"""" Yelp list for a while. It seemed like it wasn't busy on the outside but when you go to their patio that's where everyone would be at. Sunset district is always just cold and windy but they have so many heat lamps and it's enclosed area so it was really warm and cozy. The food? It's hellaaaa good. I tried their chicken wings", that was good but what took my heart was their kimchi fried rice with bulgogi. They did not use white rice so I thought that was pretty tight. I'd come back here with my friends and try more food on their menu without feeling bad that I'm eating a lot and also so I don't act like a loner in a big table.,A friend and I came here at 8 PM on a Wednesday night. We had a reservation, but we probably didn't need one. The back patio was full but there were still a few open tables. AMBIANCE: The back patio is so cute. There are string lights hanging above which give it a great ambiance. We brought jackets because we thought we would be cold, but there are tons of heaters so it is very warm.PARKING: Parking in the area isn't bad. We circled for probably 5 minutes and found a spot about 3 blocks away. THE FOOD: We ordered the seafood pancake to start. I thought it was great, and I would definitely order it again as a starter/side. Both my friend and I got bibimbap. I got mine with pork belly, and my friend got hers with bulgogi. Both of us really enjoyed our food - there's nothing better than the crispy rice in a bowl of bibimbap. I thought both the pork belly and bulgogi were excellent. The prices were amazing for SF. The bibimbap is SO much food, and it's ~$20 with meat. You could easily make two meals out of it. Overall, I thought this restaurant was excellent. If I lived in the neighborhood, I would definitely come here often!,Not the best Korean restaurant that I've been in SF," but um.ma has great atmosphere + decent food. Although I won't say the food is """"wow"""""," I really really like the concept and the naming of the restaurant -- """"for mom"""". """"For mom."""" In Korean "," """"um.ma"""" means """"mom"""". This restaurant is named to adore moms because we all think our mothers have the best home cooking.  Michelin Bib Gourmand 2021 award  (the only Korean restuarnt in SF that received the bib gourmand this year)What're in the pics?   Soondubu-Jjigae Kimchi Scallion Pancake Kimchi Fried Rice Umma Dry Wings Charred Gai-lon",Patio seating is cozy and beautiful. Service is ok. Banchan is special compared to the other usual Korean places that offers all kinds of kimchi. This one has quail eggs! All rice are purple rice. We ordered rockin roe  and it's super tasty. The meat dishes the short ribs are more flavorful than the kalbi. The beef noodle soup Sul Ling Tang is very good, creamy tasty soup!,4/5 My friend and I decided to pop into um.ma for dinner one night to catch up. Ambiance: 5/5 - The inside and the backside outdoor patio are great. I love their whole interior design and they make it really fun to just chill with someone or a group of people. The tables outside can seat a decent-sized group. I've eaten with just one other person before and also 6 people.Reservations: 5/5 - Reservations are easy to make, you can make them on Yelp / their website. It's a popular spot so you might want to book a few days ahead of time. Staff: 5/5 - Everyone I interacted with was so kind and sweet. I had just gotten a manicure so I asked if I could have gloves to eat my food and they happily accommodated chiming in that they get it. We also had no issues with the service. They were nice when we had to push our reservation by 30 minutes last minute too.Items Ordered:- Kimchi Fried Rice (5/5): This is my favorite thing to get here. I love the black rice and the fried egg on top. The rice is also always cooked exactly how I like it and it has flavor throughout. Definitely would recommend you order this if you go.- Seafood Pancake (4/5): I really liked this and would recommend it to others too! It had a good texture and crunch but could have used with a tad bit more flavor in my opinion. - Korean Fried Chicken Wings (4/5): A staple pick for us whenever we come to any Korean place. The flavors were good but I wish they had a bit more spice. The bit of a let down for me personally was that the chicken was dry inside vs other Korean places I've been that have moist chicken. - Charred Gai Lan (3.5/5): I really wanted to like this more because I love oyster mushrooms but it just lacked flavor overall. This tends to be the common letdown from um.ma. Also loved all the banchan too as per usual! I think I would come back again and while this isn't the best Korean food out there, I still really enjoyed it and would recommend them to others.,The service and ambience of this place is great. However, I was shocked to see the bibimbap come with chunky sautéed vegetables. My favorite thing about bibimbap is that each vegetable is cooked separately and slightly differently. Not only were all the vegetables cooked together, they chose the cheapest veggies (squash, carrots, spinach)... like I'm actually sad at how lazy this dish is. Presentation is pretty though. Tastes meh and I don't think this should be considered authentic bibimbap. Also the base price was $18 without additional protein. Portions are large at least.,I'm late writing this review," but this was back in that brief window of time when California was """"reopening"""" and before the delta variant hit...I went here with friends because we were going to the Cal Academy afterward and this restaurant is right between the Sunset and Golden Gate Park. I only found out later that this is apparently a Michelin guide restaurant on the """"affordable eateries"""" list - of course", affordable is subjective, as it's still a bit pricey, but I am aware many SF restaurants tend to charge more and you do get a pretty good portion per dish.Since I'm a vegetarian, I had part of the kimchi pancake which was split with my friends, and braised potatoes. I really enjoyed the kimchi pancake - it's great for anyone who loves salty, savory carbs and is bearable if you can't handle spicy food. The potatoes I didn't like quite as much just because it felt like the flavor could've been more evenly distributed; potatoes themselves were somewhat more plain whereas the cheese part was super salty, but it was a pretty filling dish at least. My friends ordered bulgogi, calbi, and pork belly which I did not try, but one friend said they liked how this restaurant cooks certain meats which they normally would find too tough or otherwise dislike the texture. I'm sorry for not labeling the meat images properly, I had trouble keeping track of which meat was which due the amount of dishes we had at a time.The servers are friendly and provided some explanation about the menu when I asked since I was not totally sure which vegetarian options were currently available. We were provided barley tea and some appetizers - bean sprouts, broccoli, a yellow pickled vegetable (I'm terrible at identifying ingredients), cucumber. Also, we got a bowl of purple rice for every person which I like for the aesthetic and for more variety than the typical white rice.,Came with a reservation on tock to celebrate a coworker's birthday. It's a little hard to park but the food looked great. We were seated promptly and each table has a QR code for the menu. I will have to say the staff forgot to serve the banchan so we had to request it. We ordered a little bit of everything and it was a solid 4 star place.Korean fried chicken: comes in an order of 10 with 3 different sauces. You can get a mix of the sauces in one order or just pick from one. The citrus gochujang was good - it was slightly citrusy but sweet and spicy. The honey butter is better in chip format as the wings were too sweet. The ginger honey soy was not bad but not memorable. All wingers were super crispy which was great.Scallian pancake: similar to that of chinese style but it was more chewy in the middle but super crispy on the outside. Delicious!Bulgogi: flavor is as expected and the beef is tender with no chewy bits. Also no aftertaste when you burp!Overall, a good solid 4 place but parking is hard to find.,Bulgogi kimchi fried rice (4.5/5) - the sous vide egg was the star of the show for me, but the bulgogi was tender and flavorful and a bit on the sweeter side, the rice was chewy and nutty, and the kimchi flavor was more understated.Rockin' Roe (4/5) - the presentation of this dish was beautiful! The colors really popped. The texture from the roe really carried this dish, but I would have liked some sort of stronger focal point, like another fish.Ambience (5/5) - the interior is chic but inviting, and the patio is spacious and equipped with heaters!,Wanted to try this place out because I've seen it here on Yelp and was also craving some Korean Fried Chicken. This place has a different touch with their Korean dishes which some were good and some were just okay. Their Korean Fried Chicken comes in 3 different flavors, Gochujang, Honey and Soy Garlic I believe. The Honey one was a bit too sweet for me, but the Gochujang and Soy Garlic were definitely a move super flavorful and was extra crispy!! I was surprised it held up that satisfying crunch with the generous amount of sauce it had on it. I honestly thought the chicken would'be been soggy but it wasn't!Also got their Kimchi Fried Rice and added bulgogi because they said it doesn't come with a protein so be sure to keep that in mind! Glad we added the bulgogi because it just added more and depth to the Kimchi Fried Rice. We're typically used to the rice being super orange/red but Um Ma uses purple rice instead of the typical jasmine rice so it turned to be a more darker looking Kimchi Fried Rice. It was on the sweeter side too, so it was very different from the usual but enjoyed it just as much! We go their Seafood Pancake and I think this might've been my least favorite dish. Seafood Pancake is a must get when visiting any Korean spot but this pancake was a bit over cooked/fried. It came out pretty dark and charred, also the only seafood that were really in it were scallops and shrimps. While other places also has a bit of imitation crab, calamari, or squid. Sauce for the pancake was also not the best. Probably wouldn't get this dish again but the other two dishes were a YES! Also service was super attentive and workers were nice! The ambiance and decor of this place is super modern, sleek and super cute! Would've gave this place a 4/5 but the Seafood Pancake was just a bit too disappointing. :(,Cute patio and great Korean food! We got the Korean fried chicken wings (all flavors) and kimchi fried rice with bulgogi. We were also served some banchan at the start of our meal which were delicious.The Korean fried chicken was good and came with lots of wings! We split it between two people and ended up with leftovers, so I think it would be good to share with more people. We got a mix of all flavors but my favorite by far was the honey butter (which was unexpected, but it's so good). The kimchi fried rice with bulgogi was sooo delicious. It was very flavorful and the runny egg yolk mixed in made it really indulgent. I'd definitely recommend trying this dish!Overall a great experience! The food is very flavorful and tasty.,The food is good, but it's not taste as authentic Korean food, especially the bibimbap. Their fired chickens are delicious. The service is not good:1. We come here like 10mins ahead of our reservation, and we stay in front door about 5mins+, no one come to us but they definitely see us standing there. I don't know why they just ignore us. Finally one waiter come to us and ask what we need, I said we have a reservation and he said we should come back later until the exactly reservation time. ( which is somehow can understand)2. When we get in and made orders, the waiter just repeat what we ordered and he can not remember what we ordered, we repeat again. Until then, we don't get water, but all other table they all have water after they sit down. We have to ask water by ourselves.3. During waiting time, the two table' guest beside us, they come in and make their orders. They order after ours, but their dishes served first! Like these two table get all their food, but we only get one bibimbap. Then the waiter saw us keeping looking at him, and he come and said the dishes are coming. And then! The next mins, he bring all the rest dishes to us..... which means the dishes already cooked but he just didn't bring them to us???? 4. The last, I'm not sure they serve complementary side dish like all Korean restaurant dose, but we saw the tables around us they all have 2-3 small side dishes, but we don't get any until we finished everything. =======I will say, the food is ok, but the service is not what we expected at all.,An awesome 1st visit. Met a former colleague here for dinner last night. Awesome backyard patio with picnic benches and major heat lamps and tons of open fresh air. The picnic benches were low for me and it was a little uncomfortable, but drinking 2 refreshing, cold Yuzu type beers on tap, helped me forget the slight discomfort.The Bulgolgi was the highlight for me. I usually go to Han IL Kwan but lately they've been overcooking it, so it was awesome to have this yummy, delicious moist and tasty Bulgolgi! YAY! Was not impressed by the Bibimbap. Won't order that again. My friend didn't eat pork so we didn't order the tofu soup. I will try that next time for sure! :0)We tried 2 of 3 fried chicken flavors (ginger sesame soy and the non-butter one). They were crispy and looked delightful. They weren't bad, but I only had 1 of each flavor. I mostly ate the Bulgolgi. The service is friendly and there are many workers even outside on the patio so we appreciated it! Can't wait to return to try the Bulgolgi," Tofu Soup and ??? Thank You! Keep up the great work and the amazing outdoor patio! LOVE it!  :0)""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dumpling Kitchen,"Excited to have Dumpling Kitchen in the Castro, and I love that they kept the murals from Papi Rico (and points for the rainbow word art menu from Microsoft). I always liked their Taraval location, so I'm happy they're branching out.Noodles come out piping hot here, freshly wok-fried, and not too oily; get the Shanghai-style chow mein! All the dumplings we've gotten have been good, from XLB to the fish & chive dumplings. Great for groups since there's plenty of seating inside and out.,Ordered via UberEats! I I ordered the salt and pepper chicken wings, braised pork belly with preserved vegetables, pan fried pork dumplings, combination fried rice, and string beans. They don't give a lot of food when you order their takeout. My gripe with this place is that it looks like they have a large menu, but actually just have very little. It's dumplings with different combinations of meats, chicken with different combinations of flavors, or fried rice/chow mein.. Salt and Pepper chicken wings: pretty good, can't go wrong w this! Juicy meat and crispy skin. Braised pork belly: the meat wasn't as tender as I would've liked. Pan fried pork bun: Had a good amount of soup, the meat was tender, the bottom was crispy, and it was the right amount of bread to meat. Just wish there were more buns in an order - 10$ for an order of 4, other restaurants typically give you 6-8 buns... The meat could've had more seasoning as well.. Combination fried rice: lots of little pieces of meat, decent but not amazing. String bean: also just decent,The food was so good--yum! I am keeping my fingers crossed that Dumpling Kitchen stays in this space that has been so many things before it: Nirvana, Papi Rico, and more!  Four stars for the food and hospitality!We sat out back because the rest of the restaurant was reserved.  This was good to note because next time we'll make a reservation. It was packed.I wouldn't say I liked sitting out back--it needs to be worked on a bit. It felt isolated and a bit dirty.  You can think of the restaurant being divided into three separate spaces: the inside [as soon as you walk in there is also a small bar area], the middle section which is a large enclosed room, and then the backyard area.The restrooms were interesting. There are two of them, but one just has three urinals.  They are so close together that you'll bump elbows with someone. They could use some TLC.  The entire restaurant could too. It needs to be picked up and cleaned up a bit. The stairs to the backyard are sketchy, for example.Service was so nice but they were slow!  Dishes came out at odd times and the condiments for the pot stickers were not brought until we asked for them.  We ate them before the soy sauce, vinegar and hot oil arrived!  Yep--they were delicious.  Kind of doughy though.Loved the assorted chow mein, shrimp dumplings, and chicken and broccoli.Good food. Nice people. Lots of options. Make a reservation!,TLDR: I appreciate their vast menu items, but I wouldn't go here again for dumplings. I'd give this place a 6.5-7/10! I prefer Dumpling House for dumplings (2-3 blocks over from Dumpling Kitchen). My partner and I did a mobile order for pick up since this place closes for the afternoon (close at 3pm). We live in the neighborhood, so the food wasn't sitting for too long before we ate it! PORK POT STICKERS: The filling was okay - a good standard pork dumpling. My only gripe is that the wrapping was really thick .. you'll see that this is a common factor in their dumplings! PEA SHOOTS WITH FRIED GARLIC: This was good! It wasn't overdone, and the garlic cloves were great and plentiful. CRISPY SALTED FISH: This was good too! It definitely had a kick to it, the jalapenos were such a nice touch. A little on the salty side, but I didn't mind it especially because we had it over white rice. CHILI OIL WONTONS: I didn't like these as much as I was hoping. The wrapping was really thick, stuffing was okay. Their chili oil was the redemption factor of this dish - definitely had a kick. CHICKEN AND CORN DUMPLINGS: I didn't like these at all. The stuffing was interesting in that it was hard .. and not soft at all? There was a lot of corn in it which I appreciate, but the chicken texture was so odd. It wasn't juicy. Definitely on the end of a firm dumpling ..,Is this the best Chinese restaurant in SF, no... but it's pretty good for this neighbourhood. The prices are reasonable and the service here is very good. I really like the young people who work here, they are very friendly and know about Chinese culture stuff. Like I eat my Chinese food with an empty bowl, and they get it. The food is delicious and the chef is very accommodating! I got a 辣子豆腐，like I was surprised he would even do it! But I asked and he could:) if you have ever been to China you know they eat a lot of veggies over there, and here we ordered all the green veggies and they were perfect. Get the cucumbers and green beans. We had a perfectly healthy and tasty meal! Also their hot chilli oil and vinegar are good quality and good flavor:) the restaurant is much bigger than it looks and the vibe is chill but fun...,A perfect place to go with a group of 4 people, so you can maximize the dishes you get to try.  With a name like Dumpling Kitchen, of course the dumplings are excellent.  But there are also some great meat dishes and noodle dishes, so don't be totally dumpling-centric.Shanghai-style Steamed Pork Dumplings (Xiao Long Bao): It's pretty much obligatory that I order these whenever a restaurant has them.  That first bite and slurp of soup (i.e. fatty goodness) is so perfect.  After all the juice is sucked out though, it's kinda like a regular pork dumpling.  Still delicious.Shanghai-style Pan-fried Pork Buns: Seemed very popular here.  Thick dough where one side is nicely browned crispy and the other side is steamed like a dumpling.  Great texture contrast.  Pretty big size and filling.  The pork inside is nice too.Boiled Chicken & Corn Dumplings: Kinda bland.  Needed a good amount of chili oil from the table to liven it up.Beijing-style Noodle in Black Bean Sauce: Lots of umami goodness in this rich meaty black bean sauce.  Also, the noodles are nice and springy.  Definitely a fan favorite at the table.Braised Lion's Head Meatballs: Huge balls!  Nice mix of minced meat and fat.  Lots of rich sauce, so be sure to spoon some extra on what you're eating.Braised Pork Belly with Preserved Vegetables: Perhaps my favorite non-dumpling dish.  The pork belly was super tender so the fat was almost melting in your mouth while the meat was easy to shred.  What really struck me was how well the fat in the pork belly soaked up the flavorful sauce and spices.Pea Sprouts with Garlic: Why is this veggie dish priced the same as the pork belly?  Totally not worth it.  It's jut some plain greens with a little garlic.  Note that the rich meatballs and pork belly come with some bright greens anyway.,So glad to have another solid Chinese restaurant in Castro! We went for the soft opening and felt like they were still figuring things out, but excited to see how they improve with more time.FOODBeef Shank & Tripe in Chili Oil - This one is a Chinese classic that I order as a baseline at most restaurants I go to. It was really well-seasoned, albeit a little too salty. The pieces of beef shank were super thick cut, whereas I feel like this dish is usually thin, deli-slice style beef pieces. Shanghai-Style Steamed Pork Buns - The xiaolongbao here were pretty reasonable! The wrapper was not as chewy as I usually prefer, which also meant it tore super easily when it stuck to the steamer. At this price point though this is a solid place for XLB.Shanghai-Style Pan Fried Pork Buns - This is one of my favorite Shanghainese foods, so I order it whenever I get the chance. I really enjoyed their version of it, though it had a slightly stronger deep fried oil taste on the bottom than I'm used to.Pea Sprouts w/ Garlic - Solid stir fry! Will definitely be back if I'm craving Shanghainese food.,A small storefront tucked in the heart of the Castro surprises you instantly if you walk in and ask to be seated in the back patio. We went midday on a Sunday and saw that this place had just had its grand opening! Din Sum gets all the love in San Francisco, it's about time to see another Shanghainese place pop up. We ordered the classics, the pork XLB and the pan fried pork bun, both had incredible flavor and were so juicy. While the flavors were spot on, the XLB didn't have the smooth looking skin you'd expect and the pan fried buns had a bit of a thick bottom. The dan dan noodles were delicious and had a perfect texture, but the chili oil wontons left much to be desired. They were really mild in flavor and had a very thick wonton skin. Overall this place had such a home-y feel and mostly nailed all the nostalgic flavors from my childhood, but there are some imperfections with the skins for the buns, wontons, and XLB. They're just starting out and I'd be interested to check out how they improved in the near future!,Came to this location this past Sunday after visiting the Taraval location a few times. I was extremely excited to try it out and to have a location closer to where I am in the Mission.We had a large group, and the restaurant was comfortably able to accommodate all 10 of us. There is plenty of space and there is even a back patio for outdoor dining.For food options, we shared a few things. Notably the XLB, Hot and Sour Soup, Pan Fried Dumplings, Veggie Dumplings, and Veggie Chow Mein.The veggie dumplings we got were a little soupier/ wetter than anticipated. The hot and sour soup was on point, and the XLB and pan-fried dumplings were also really solid.I will also add that I prefer the sauce/ condiment selection at the Taraval location a little bit more - the chili oil there is a lot more flavorful and the black vinegar is a little more potent.Overall though, taking service and food into account, We had a really great meal at this location and it was super good to see a Dumpling Kitchen open up in this part of town. Will be sure to stop by again sometime soon to check out more items on the menu.4/5,Really good food. Service was ok. I've been twice, environment it's cute. I would go again.,544 Castro used to be the home of one of my favorite Castro eateries, Nirvana, where the casually exotic vibe was a nice match for their fusion fare. Then it became a splashy cantina, Papi Rico, and I thought it would stick around for a while. But it didn't probably because it couldn't gain traction due to the pandemic. Now it's become what I believe is the third location of Dumpling Kitchen. They started with their popular spot on Taraval, and they recently opened a spot off the Cal campus in Berkeley.In fact, I just tried that one for takeout last week. That's why I was surprised to see them at this prime location where they kept Papi Rico's fluorescent aquamarine facade. Inside it looks like a sleekly contemporary version of their familiar operation. Of course their menu featured a long list of dim sum selections, but there were other dishes as well...noodles, soups, mushu, chef's specials, even steamed chocolate baos. But I was in a dumpling mood, so I ordered two of their specialties.First up were the $9.80 Boiled Chicken and Corn Dumplings, eight little tightly tucked pillows filled with minced chicken and corn kernels (photo: bit.ly/3RBRfe5). The red chili oil enhanced the slightly bland flavor. The second dish was the clincher, the $10.80 Steamed Shrimp and Pork Shumai. There were only four of them, but each were meaty and hearty (photo: bit.ly/3B4roVi). I definitely want to try those steamed chocolate baos sometime. I hope Dumpling Kitchen lasts longer than Papi Rico.FOOD - 4 stars...solid dumplings, some tastier than othersAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...spacious enough though I miss the serene Nirvana vibeSERVICE - 4 stars...enthusiastic, still in the honeymoon phaseTOTAL - 4 stars...dumplings in the Castro, a new era beginsRELATED - Exploring the Castro? Here's a collection of places I've visited and reviewed: bit.ly/2HrpFPC,I have fond memories of Dumpling Kitchen's original location on Taraval.It was my dining companion's first time having XLB and he tried to jab it with a metal spoon to pick it up.What monster does that to a XLB?! Oh yea, and he's Chinese. *FACE PALM*So happy to see one of The Sunset/Parkside's local favs open in The Castro because IMO, the Chinese restaurants in this area can be underwhelming/Americanized. And, one of the best parts?They have a outdoor garden patio!Soft opening today is Dumpling Kitchen's second SF location in the former Papi Rico space. They're open for takeout, indoor dining, and outdoor dining. Well-behaved dogs are allowed in the patio. Delivery to come.With the mandate lifted, staff still wore masks.M E N UNorthern Chinese & Shanghainese Cuisine.Limited Soft Opening Menu: Apps, Soups, Dumplings, Entrees, Noodles/Rice/Rice cakes, Dessert, etc. -- Page 1: bit.ly/3TR3tkr-- Page 2: bit.ly/3cUwgUNExclusive items to The Castro location: Giant Crab XLB and Black Truffle & Beef Fried Rice. F O O D(Excuse the yellow tint on the pics from the yellow sun sail canopy.)* Beef Shank & Tripe in Chili Oil ($13.80): bit.ly/3TSjl6kClassic Northern Chinese cold starter with tender slices of beef shank and chewy soft and gelatinous slices of tripe+tendon bathed in a málà numbing oil. * Pan-fried Pork Buns aka Sheng Jian Bao (4 pc - $9.80): bit.ly/3exZeuc***Allow about 20 minutes to prepare.Never tried Dumpling Kitchen's SJB, XLB's cousin so I had to give it a try at their new location.These SJB are HUGE. When I tried lifting it with the chopsticks, I dropped it because it was heavier than the norm. Upon biting into the SJB, it squirted hot soupy goodness. Large, savory pork filling; no huge air pocket. Love the contrasting textures - the bottoms were golden brown and crunchy with nicely chewy steamed tops.Really good with the black vinegar and ginger. * Shanghai Stir-Fried Rice Cakes aka Nian Gao ($13.80): bit.ly/3D6Oo8DDeliciously chewy and savory rice cakes with strips of tender pork and crisp cabbage+carrot+onions. Good smoky wok hei flavor. Bomb with their housemade chili oil. If you like chewy rice cakes, GET THIS!S E R V I C EThe owner and staff are warm, welcoming, and friendly. The manager, Johnny was kind and responsive when I contacted them about outdoor dining. I arrived right when they opened for lunch so food service was prompt. There's a call button for the outdoor patio tables.A M B I A N C EColorful and festive, Dumpling Kitchen kept some of the same decor as Papi Rico minus the mankini bottoms on the wall.Love the garden patio vibes: bit.ly/3qCnw9f. P A R K I N GResidential and street parking. Doable on the weekdays. Overall, Dumpling Kitchen is a great addition to The Castro. If you're looking for legit Northern Chinese & Shanghainese cuisine in the area, def hit them up!,Super happy to see a restaurant open up in the  previously Papi Rico space. It's a lovely space with a back patio that needs to be used.Overall the food here was great, and I would definitely come back to try more dumplings. All the dumplings were great, you really can't go wrong. The service was a bit slow, probably due to the fact they have just opened and are likely training staff. We put ourselves in on the Yelp waitlist, but when I talked to the person at the host stand, they said they hadn't checked it. The host seemed busy bussing tables, taking orders, and bringing food out, so likely they are understaffed at the moment. There were also a couple of items on the menu that they didn't have in stock, including the chocolate dumplings. I hope those arrive soon!I'm looking forward to them.All that is to say: I expect and hope these issues will be fixed soon. I have no doubt it's hard to start a business in the Castro. I can't wait to come back in a few months and have a 5 star experience.,I just ordered this for takeout and it absolutely did not disappoint. We got the chili wontons, pan fried pork bao, bbq pork buns, and the Shanghai style rice cakes. Everything was spectacular, the chili wontons almost had a slight peanut taste to the sauce which was just perfect. The pan fried baos were juicy and crispy. The bbq pork buns are a classic and very well done, perfectly sweet and moist. The Shanghai rice cakes were texturally amazing, such a great chew. I could have done with slightly more flavor, just some chili oil on them would be perfect. Overall I will absolutely be back, we were blown away by everything.,I am here in San Francisco on vacation and I am so happy that I came here for dinner!It was delicious and I loved the service we received! I loved the sizzling rice soup so much!!!!Definitely recommend :),What a great addition to the neighborhood! Dumpling Kitchen was a bright, vibrant and bustling with energy the Sunday afternoon we visited. The team was very nice and all our food arrived so quickly. Every dish was very flavorful and I kept wanting more! My favorites were definitely the wontons in chili oil--the heat from the chili oil was nice. I'd definitely come back and bring more friends, the space is great for groups.,I've never had such blatantly unsafe to eat food served at a restaurant. Absolutely horrible. I got served pork dumplings with raw pork (hot on the outside and raw inside). Returned them and subsequently was served RAW CHICKEN dumplings. Omg they are so horrible it's a joke. Whelp, so much for a MamaJi's competitor.Also service is slow.,We are happy with the wok fried items but want to highlight all dim sum we ordered were terribly executed. Pork bun is crispy from the outside but the filling is plain and faint. Don't really have the enjoyment of having a good bite of pork bun filling. Shrimp dumpling or Har Gow is so wrong in every way. They didn't bother to break the dumplings apart before steaming it. The texture of skin is also wrong, soggy, sticky, and very thick. The filling is made of smaller shrimps and they break apart easily. Definitely do not recommend,Excellent dumplings!! The best in town, especially the friend dumplings. The braised pork is authentic as is the fried rice cake. Could not recommend more highly. The Castro location is hip and fun.,Fantastic food! My friend and I had the following dishes (in the order from best to worst, but even the ""worst"" dish was still good):- Shanghai-style pan-fried pork buns - a MUST-get! Soooo good. Very flavorful juicy meat, and the bun bread was soft and doughy at the top but also perfectly crispy/fried at the bottom. - Black truffle with beef fried rice - never had truffle fried rice before--and. It. Is. The. BOMB. I could taste the truffle in every bite, and yet the flavor was not overpowering. It was smooth, rich, and very tasty.  - Steamed giant crab meat dumplings - came with generous portions of soft, flavorful crab meat. Very novel kind of dumplings for me (I had never heard of crab meat in dumplings before), so it was a great experimental dish to try. - Eggplant with garlic sauce - great standard classic dish. Nothing more that needs to be said lol. - Steamed BBQ pork bao - meh. The meat was tasty, but portions were quite small and mostly of bread, not much meat. I would rather buy BBQ pork baos (which are larger) from cheap fast Asian bakeries.,How this place can be less than 5 stars I don't know.  Hurry on down before they get wise and raise the prices.I had Mongolian beef.  The thinly slices beef was meltingly tender, contrasting nicely with the al-dente sauteed onions and peppers. At my request they added steamed broccoli, which was arranged around the dish edge.  These were excellent with the house made chili oil. The sauce though. Delicate with a sweetness and spiciness that must be savoured.  It's been a while since neighborhood Chinese gave me a happy surprise.,It's ok in location adjusted terms. Could you get better on the westside or chinatown? Yes. But as an option in the castro, it's alright. The XLB in general could have more soup and thinner skin (which is generally what you're going for). The XJB are too doughy. The beef tripe tendon in chili oil could be softer.,I grew up in Shanghai and I have very high standards for Xiao long bao (Shanghai style steamed soup dumplings) and Sheng Jian bao (pan fried little pork buns). This place has hands down the best dumplings in San Francisco. The pork belly is another traditional Shanghainese dish (acquired taste) that I totally loved. The flavor is so rich and smooth. A few other modified dishes also impressed me, including the black truffle fried rice (you can see the truffle pieces and totally taste it in every bite. It's a big portion too) and the butter garlic edamame. This is going to be my new go to place in Castro.,The people that work here are so kind and welcoming. We had such a great time sitting at the bar and chatting with the people working. The food was so good!!! I usually have a few go-to dumpling places and I am definitely adding this into my rotation. A must-go for sure!,FINALLY!!!!! This space and this neighborhood have a good restaurant!Our first time so we played it safe and went our GOSB's (good old stand bys), bbq pork baos, green onion pancake, seafood pan fried noodle (presented like a free standing bird's nest) and sweet and sour chicken. Everything was delicious. Portions were nice sized. Food was so hot and fresh. Service was great (who cares if they're ""trying too hard"" better than the alternative). You can watch the dumplings actually being made in the back of the main dining room (who doesn't love a little show). They were almost maxed out on a Wednesday dinner and not a cranky queen to be seen (a near miracle in this neighborhood) which is a great sign. Looking forward to making this a regular gig. Good job!ps the owner/mgr explained how they hand make the noodles in house and they're outstanding,I ordered DK via delivery. I had high hopes after seeing great reviews but was disappointed by lack of food safety. 1 - smashed cucumbers were put in a paper box that got soaked through, opened and leaked around whole delivery bag.2 - my har gow order was full of undercooked, raw shrimp.I realized #2 well into eating some, and hope I do not become ill as a result. Other than this, food tasted good but food safety comes first.I hope you can resolve these issues.,So totally thrilled to find this place! We just attended the grand opening today (10/8/22): the food was freshly delicious & the service seamlessly attentive without any of the usual hiccups of a normal brand new opening. Everyone who works here is well-masked (in adorable Pride Rainbow surgical masks) and I as an immunocompromised person felt completely comfortable & safe eating in the well-ventilated outdoor back patio. Honestly I probably would've ordered my mail to go if they didn't have this patio, because there is no sidewalk seating which is fine by me bc I prefer a little privacy when I dine! The back patio is both intimate and spacious at the same time with 7 tables well-spaced for social distancing.My favorite was the noodles with ground pork & black bean sauce (very filling enough for 2 people) and the pan-fried pork dumpling a strong second. We also ordered chow mein which we added broccoli to & our special request was honored.The dumpling dipping sauce is light and flavorful and their chili oil is so fragrant. What I love most about this spot is they manage to have both great food and ambience which not all dumpling places are able to accomplish!,We once lived in San Francisco, and find ourselves returning to the Castro several times a year.  Today we discovered Dumpling Kitchen.....  and to be honest, the young ladies who answered our questions, (I'm vegetarian), coupled with the adorable patio out back, won us over. And in we went.  The servers were gracious, efficient, and helpful.  We identified several items on the menu, not all vegetarian, and ordered.  The dishes were delivered to our patio table in a timely manner, and with a smile.  Presentation was very nice.  Everything we had was delicious, onoliscious as we'd say on Oahu, and the prices were reasonable.  The fact that the table next to us had a doggie at their feet only made the lunch all that much more enjoyable..... and Moe was a rescue dog from Kauai to boot!  Maika'i !!!While we ate outside, which was wonderful, the indoor restaurant was very nice.  Tidy, organized, etc.   We would have been happy with an indoor table as well.Will we be back?  Absolutely!,Popped into this place to check it out for the first time and was super impressed!  Lemon chicken was super flavorful and just the right about of crispy.  The cucumber salad had this amazing sauce - also super tasty, and the dumplings were cooked perfectly. We were in a hurry so we only ordered a few things, but everything that came out of the kitchen from other guests that passed by our table looked so delicious.  I will definitely go back and try even more things on the menu.  Really happy to see such a great spot in Castro!,So happy to have them in my neighborhood! I usually dine alone after work a half block up. Always really friendly and welcoming, very clean inside. Food is delicious - the pan fried dumplings with pork are outrageous! Love the Har Gow shrimp dumplings and mild Ma Po tofu. The Shanghai noodles look wonderful but I haven't tried them yet. A welcome addition to the Castro,The food here is so freaking good! The Black Truffle beef and rice! The salt and pepper fish! I just can't get enough!,Love this new restaurant in the Castro. I've been there multiple times since they opened. Delicious food and a good place to meet friends. They also have a backyard patio garden for outdoor dining.,Dough is really thick for the potstickers and dumplings. Would be a lot better if the dough wasn't as thick on everything. The lemon chicken is really good here as well as the truffle fried rice. 3 stars overall, as they shrank the size of the beef roll to 4 tiny pieces instead of the usual 6, but keeping the same price. The beef roll was my favorite thing in the menu but it's not worth the money anymore.,Their 生煎包 and chocolate buns are epic. trust me.,Finally, a legit Shanghainese restaurant! Really cute neighborhood spot with great food, including some really good Shanghai classics like soup dumplings and 糯米烧卖 along with more standard Chinese restaurant fare,Finalky Dumpling kitchen has been open @ Castro！  Love their pork buns and soup dumplings！,XLB was delicious and so was the mushu chicken. Next time I'll order more variety of dumplings.,Had a fabulous dinner here! The service was great - very friendly staff, attentive throughout the meal, over-communicated any allergy concerns, etc. Food was fantastic and reasonably priced. Can't wait to come back!,This place is AMAZING. Food is great. Soup dumplings, Pan fried pork buns, black truffle fried rice, garlic green beans everything we ordered was phenomenal. Make sure to check out their patio, many decorations with a perfect vibe for day and night. We will definitely be back next time at night time to see all the lights.,I was excited to try a new restaurant in the Castro last week.  When my boyfriend and I arrived, we were seated immediately as it was not busy.  We ordered drinks and my boyfriend's glass of wine was more like a shot.  This was $7?  Granted $7 isn't expensive, but this pour was pitiful. For food we weren't super hungry so we ordered one main and a few dim sum items.  We ordered General Chicken, Pot Stickers, Shanghai Style Fried Pork Buns, and Red Bean Bao.  The General Chicken came out in about 3 minutes and looked cheaper than Panda Express.  It had that funky spongy bread coating.  There were about 10 pieces served with a little broccoli.  While we ate this, a couple was seated at the next table and they ordered.  We then began the wait for the rest of our food.  And wait. And wait... The next table started receiving their food and we still didn't have anything else.  Servers would pick up steamer baskets and head our direction, pause, and head back to the kitchen, then return to another table with a different basket.  After about 20 minutes, we were served our plate of 4 pot stickers.  I asked if the pork buns would be arriving soon and was told yes, but it was another 10 minutes.  Our neighbors now had their entire order. When the pork buns arrived, I asked that they just bring out the Red Bean Bao dessert so we wouldn't have to be waiting again.  Wrong.  Cue confused servers walking half way over with steamer baskets before turning back to the kitchen at least 3 times.  After the last basket was handed back to the kitchen for a moment, it was handed back to a server who finally brought it to our table.  The server explains that the kitchen made the wrong dish and that we could have the salted egg bao she brought free while we waited for the correct item.  When she opened it, revealing two bao, it was clear that the last trip to the kitchen was to pare down the order so we weren't given a full order for free.  When asked how long on the red bean bao, she says 5 minutes.  However, as she quickly walked away, she said our item would be out in 5-10 minutes.  10 Minutes it was.  Long story long, the whole experience will not be repeated as I will never return and don't recommend it to anyone else.  This restaurant space has turned over no less than 8 times in my 32 years in SF.  I guess it's just destined to house one failed experiment after another.,New favorite restaurant. Great customer service. Dog friendly patio that is HUGE - covered patio and lots of tables in a wind protected back area. Food was amazing - XLB SO FRESH and generous amounts of meat, Panfried Baos, Eggplant, pork fried rice.the XLB were made on site (you can even watch the person making them!) and the XLB were even better IMHO than the Taraval branch. Customer service was AMAZING everyone was so nice and attentive. they even have buttons on the tables to ask for service. We arrived on a Friday right at 12 and no one was there. by the time we left at 1pm, the whole place was totally packed but the garden patio was not crowded at all - which was nice. It was cold and windy outside but the back patio was nice and warm. There are few Chinese places that have outdoor dining options and are dog friendly. I'm so excited to find this place. easy 2 hour free parking around the corner in the residential areas. We are a huge fan of the Taraval branch and were so pleased that they opened another place with wonderful outdoor dining options in SF.,I found this place very average. The service was lacking. They used a microwave for a lot of our food. It came out in an odd order. The hot and sour soup wasn't that tasty. I wild say if you want dumplings, go to Mama Ji or Bao for a much better use of your money and time.,Soft opening but pretty good. Looking forward to seeing it again when it's fully open. Some items are not available yet but should be soon, can't wait for the chocolate dumplings!!!,Have been to sunset location many times for their pork buns and soup dumplings, called to ask was told this restaurant was owned by the same owner as sunset location. Now I don't have to drive all the way to sunset to get my favorite dumplings!! The pork buns and soup dumplings are the best in San Francisco ！！,Good foods & decent environment in the neighborhood!  Strongly recommend - soup dumplings & the buns!,So happy that Dumpling Kitchen took over this space. We have been back twice since the soft opening and both times the food was served promptly and was outstanding in flavor and portions. I can definitely recommend the Black Truffle with Beef Fried Rice, Kung Pao Chicken, Lemon Chicken, Pan Fried Seafood Noodle, Walnut Prawns.,The combination plate was so good. Just overall the experience and the ambiance was really good. The staff was so friendly, I'll definitely be coming back.,Quite good XLB, but the other dishes were not satisfying. The pork in their sweetened vinegar sauce spare ribs dish didn't seem very fresh. And unfortunately the green onion noodles dish was comprised of just noodles stir-fried in green onions and oil, with a handful of shrimp and the dreaded peas-and-tiny-carrot-cubes combo on top -- pretty bland and oily, although I don't know Shanghainese cuisine enough to know whether it's authentic. I might look forward to coming back to try different dishes though, especially since they're only in their soft opening phase right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well balanced choices in menu, good food coming out of kitchen. Ample seating at entryway and in inner courtyard. Hardworking and polite staff. Very reasonable prices for generous servings.,Order was wrong and arrived over 30 minutes late. The foos was ok, not great. There are better dim sum options.,Good restaurant! I highly recommend the shrimp and pork shumai and the Shanghai style pork soup dumplings. The green onion pancake is my favorite too.,Wow!! Seriously, the food is beyond good. I ordered the wontons in chili oil, pan fried pork bun, soup dumplings, and the Shanghai Style Chow Mein. It was too good to be real. The customer service was on top, everyone was super friendly and helpful. I will definitely come back again to try out more food :)),Don't be put off by the decor. The food is great. Especially the choice of dumplings. The price is reasonable. Have become a regular patron.,Let's face it:  finding good old-school Shanghai fare in the City can be a challenge.   The quietly legendary DumplingKitchen out in the SS has always been a treat but a fair distance to go for us central-city folk, so the new location in the heart of the Castro is truly welcome.   And though this spot looks and feels quite different from the humble & homey little nook on Taraval, the menu is just as good if slightly more metro.   Worth a visit.,10/10 recommend stopping by here, had some soup, dumplings, wontons, and spare ribs and everything was amazing! Employees and very nice and service is quick. Definitely will be returning!,Best dim sum.  You can watch them make it in a special booth in the dining area.  Nice patio out back!,Great to have good Chinese restaurant in the Castro.    Tried a bunch of stuff but favorites were the truffle beef fried rice and Shanghai style pan fried pork buns.    Will definitely be back.,This is not a dumpling place but a mediocre Chinese restaurant with a 100 + items on the menu.,Great dim sum in the Sunset district on Taraval Street in the Parkside neighborhood. There is usually a line, even when it opens, but it is definitely worth the wait!The Shanghai style pan-fried dumplings and the Lion head meatballs stood out. The other dim sum and veggies were also delicious. The prices are average for San Francisco (if you are from outside the SF Bay Area it may seem expensive), but you will be treated to a meal you will never regret.Parking is a bit tricky but you can find spots in the residential areas.The perfect start to a SF weekend is a dim sum brunch here and a walk along the nearby beaches.,We've not been back here in years but after dining here for lunch I think the food has gotten better. They were crazy busy with 3-4 servers hustling back and forth from the kitchen. The wait list to sign up is on an iPad by the door if you walk in. There's not enough staff to answer the phone.  Some folks linger chatting away long after they were done eating and they should flag down the staff to settle the bill so other diners can sit.  We were seated long after 3 guys and after we ate they were still there and clearly done by their empty plates. We were happy with all our 3 tasty dishes.The pan fried Shanghai soup dumplings, $11.50 for 6, didn't have a great deal of soup in them as noted by others. But there was a big chunk of meat filling and delish but I did have better tasting dumplings of the same in Chinatown.  The XLB was good but again not enough soup in them. We shared a bowl of beef tendon noodles with spinach in it. Very good and noodles were cooked just right, it was the most expensive at $15. There is a surcharge if you use a credit card but a discount if you pay cash which is nicely outlined on the receipt.  Hope to be back but not looking forward to the crowds.,Ambiance is good and the staffs are nice. They have one of the best soup dumplings in San Francisco and its my go to when I want xiao long Bao. Must try: ( all 5/5)- Xiao long Bao with crab filling - dan dan noodle- Beijing Style Sweet Buns- Chili Wontons- Pan Fried Pork Buns- salty ham and veggie crispy rice,Food is great, service is cool, and despite parking being a challenge bc HELLO, SUNSET?! we find ourselves at Dumpling Kitchen almost every time we're on Taraval for anything else.Here's what we picked up this trip:A1. Shanghai-Style Steamed Pork Dumplings10 for $13.25A5. Shanghai-Style Pan-Fried Pork Buns 6 for $13.25A17. Steamed BBQ Pork Baos 3 for $8.75G11. Salt & Pepper Chicken WingsEntree portion $17.50Not pictured bc they were devoured before I could get a pic despite everyone knowin the My Camera Eats Before Anyone Eats rules,The pan fried dumplings are the best I've ever had. This is a must try. You can smell the fried aroma when picking the dumpling up with your chopsticks. The crunchy texture along with the flavorful pork filling will make this dish the most memorable.The XLB is good. The dough isn't as chewy as I would like in my dumpling skin. Be careful with eating it with one go because the soup is piping hot. The vegetarian shumai would satisfy any vegetarian cravings for dimsum. I like how abundant the vegetable is in each piece.Salted egg yolk bao is probably my favorite way to end the dinner. It's warm, savory and delicious. The bao is soft and the filling flows out after you bite into it. It's sooo goood. The orders may take a while to come because they're freshly making the dumplings by hand. You can see them in the corner making it.,This is the 2nd time ever that I've tried Sheng Jian Bao (SJB), which is A05 Shanghai Style Pan Fried Pork Buns on the menu. Many Yelp reviewers recommended this dish, saying it contains more soup than the Xiao Long Bao (A01 Shanghai-Style Steamed Pork Buns), so I gave it a go. Impressive how much broth one dumpling contains! However, I think I still prefer the smaller dumpling size of XLB over SJB because it's easier to eat. If your goal is to experience Shengjian Bao, Dumpling Kitchen would be a good choice.I actually loved these tasty dishes more than the SJB: - Pork with Preserved Vegetable Rice Cake - Dry Braised String BeansAs another Yelp reviewer wrote, the rice cake is sliced thinner than what you'd buy at the grocery store. I'm guessing the restaurant makes and slices the rice cakes themselves.The string beans weren't as braised and wrinkly looking as I was wishing, but they tasted fresh and yummy and still had a bite to them.I wouldn't recommend the Mu Shu Pork, but impressive that it generously came with 6 pancakes. The fried egg was fried and overdried too much that I could hardly recognize it as egg. It softened as leftovers when I steamed it to reheat.Restaurant has no parking lot, so you'll face the typical San Francisco neighborhood street parking issues.If you're a fan of dumplings, check out Dumpling Kitchen. Very fast in-restaurant service. I love the fun specialty Chinese menu offerings: Savory Soy Milk Bowl, Chinese Fried Dough (youtiao), Sticky Rice Roll, Beef Shank and Tripe, Pig Ear, Five Spice Beef Stew Noodle Soup, Jajangmyeon or Beijing Style Noodle in Black Bean Sauce, Dan Dan Noodles, Lion's Head Meatballs, Dry Fried Chicken Wings, and more! Shrimp Fried Rice looked amazing at another table and in Yelp photos, and the Crab & Pork Steamed Dumplings received good reviews too.,So yummy! My new favorite shanghai chinese restaurant! We were able to get seated right away for dinner on the weekend. There's only street parking but it wasn't too bad. Highly recommend:- Xiao long bao- Mongolian beef- Salt n pepper wings- Pan fried pork buns,I was craving pan fried dumplings. Was excited to see a place that had them nearby. We also got the Shanghai udon noodles. The pan fried dumplings were good! The filling was soft and was flavorful. These had a lot of dough! I still liked them.The noodles were very soft and delicious. You can see the generous sauce and chicken/veggies. I'd get these items again! Quick for pickup.,Ordered takeout for family dinner since getting everyone ready and having multiple kids makes it hard to get out of the house. Ordered 12 different items and the best items were the XLB dumplings, pan fried dumplings, salt and pepper spareribs and the dan dan (peanut sauce noodles). We also ordered the dried fried chicken wings to compare to san tung and it was in a general tsao style sauce which was okay but was not really dry fried. The black bean noodle didn't really have much flavor although the noodles overall here have good texture due to being fresh. Shanghai chow mein was cooked well and wasn't overly greasy but again also didn't have much flavor. The only item with good flavor was the dumplings and the dan dan noodle. Beef noodle soup tasted noodly which I guess is good and beef was tender but soup was pretty bland. We got both the salt and pepper sparerib which was actually very good although a little spicy, the vinegar pork was okay but not really something to write home about.  Parking in the area is a little tough depending on the time of day but you can find a spot on side streets most of the time. So if you come here stick to the dumplings as the name says and maybe try a noodle dish or two.,*Uber EATS review*Delivery destination was only 15 minutes away so items arrived on time and piping hot.Ordered Shanghai soup dumplings, veggie dumplings, veggie shumai and Shanghai thick and noodles.I really liked the veggie shunai filling (veggie, mushroom and tofu filling).  I thought it was very creative since it was mainly filled with a leafy vegetable that held seasoning and flavor well.  I'm like some veggies this vegetable did not have a lot of liquid or moisture coming out so it wasn't soggy.  I'm not sure what veggie it is but love it since it added a great crunch.Soup dumplings were good for a takeout. It didn't have any soup left but the flavor of the meat was slightly gingery which I prefer.  Will definitely order from this place again!,Oh my Dumping Kitchen.  You know I love me some dumpin's!We got some Egg Yolk stuff!  Some Steamed Bun stuff!  And some Shanghai stuff!I dunno.  I usually just let the lady handle the ordering when we come to places like this.  She's Shanghainese and Japanese (crazy, I know.), so she's knows all the good stuff, and better yet, she knows what IIIIII like.This German blood and white-a$$ skin means that I frighten easily when faced with obscure foods.  Don't get me wrong, I can and have eaten a lot of really weird stuff.  But don't get me wronger, cuz I also can NOT eat a LOT of things.  Like Cartilage. It's so tough.  So chewy.  Whyyyy???  People LOVE that schizzo.  So let me be the good guy here: you guys can eat it all you want, and I will gladly let you have my portion.  Synergyyyyyy, babyyyyy!!!  You scratch my back - I eat your fries.LuvYa ;),san francisco food is a hit or miss and most times you won't know unless you try! My friends and I loved dumpling kitchen. Everything was fresh and pretty quick. Our wait time wasn't too long and it was a busy sunday evening. The workers were all super fast and patient even when it was busy. The food was good, hot and delicious. The tea was very pleasant in between foods. Overall a great place to go to,The quality and flavor of the food here is amazing, and I don't think we disliked any of the 6 types of dishes we ordered. We ordered 7 total dishes which came out to about $85, which we thought was very reasonably priced, and our party of 4 was stuffed. Service was quick and friendly.For most of the dumplings/wontons, BEWARE IT'S HOT and likely has soup inside, even the pan-fried ones. We all burned our tongues (but worth it).The dishes we had in order of preference...#F05 Pea Sprouts with Garlic-- this was surprisingly amazing, slightly sweet, and very savory (and garlicky!)-- this was hands down the overall favorite in our party of 4#A11 Wontons in Chili Oil (8pcs)-- these were so flavorful with the chili oil and our close runner up favorite, and not spicy#A05 Shanghai-Style Pan-Fried Pork Buns (6pcs)-- these had an interesting mix of slightly crunchy on some parts of the outside and soft/flavorful on the inside-- has soup and very hot, suggested to take a small bite/poke a small hole to let the heat escape before eating#A15 Steamed Shrimp Har Gow (4pcs)-- very savory and shrimp cooked perfectly-- skin/wrapping not too rubbery-- nice having this dim sum dish option even for dinner#A17 Steamed BBQ Pork Baos (4pcs, we ordered 2)-- nice balance of bun and inside filling; filling was flavorful#A01 Shanghai-Style Steamed Pork Dumplings (10pcs)-- aka xiao long bao-- flavor was good but not very strong; wrapping was a little rubbery-- not a lot of soup inside and even had less than the pan-fried which you'd think would be the other way around-- same note about having soup and very hot; suggested to take a bite or poke hole to let out heat before eating-- good with a little soy sauce and vinegar (2:1 ratio)Parking was street only and fairly difficult on a Saturday night. We got lucky and didn't have to search long and parked across the street. We were keeping an eye on the Yelp waitlist, but there was no need to check in early since there was no wait when we walked in shortly after 5 PM. As we ate, the place started filling quickly.,Stopped by here for lunch this past Thursday on the recommendation of my girlfriend. I have to say I was thoroughly impressed.My girlfriend and I split a few items and I got one item for myself. Our order included- Mapo Tofu (Vegetarian)- Shanghai Stir fried rice cakes (Which the restaurant kindly made vegetarian at our request)- Steamed Vegetarian Dumplings- Pork and Crab Steamed DumplingsEverything came out perfectly and quickly - the Mapo Tofu was perfectly spiced in both a heat and mala sense. The numbing flavor was just what I was looking for.The dumplings were also cooked perfectly and paired well with the black vinegar and house chili oilThe rice cakes were also great - perfectly cooked with a nice medley of vegetables.Would definitely recommend anyone looking for Sichuan-style food and dumplings to give this place a visit. With their great food and friendly service, you won't be dissapointed.5/5,Honestly this place is just alright. It's cheap and I'll give it that but the quality is just ok. Not amazing. Not worth making the drive here for the quality. But the service and price is good. Parking can be challenging to find as well,I'd heard a lot of great things about Dumpling Kitchen and finally made it out here. Unfortunately I was disappointed by the lack of options for someone like me who doesn't eat pork. I was really looking forward to eating their well known dumplings, especially the fluffy looking Shanghai style ones. But I discovered that there are very few options among dim sum that don't have pork, aside from some pan fried options that I wasn't interested in. In the end I didn't even end up ordering dumplings because of this. I got chow mein which was fine but a bit too salty. The service was relatively quick but the waiters will not pay any attention to you if you don't flag them down. I am sure the food here is great for anyone who can eat all types of meat, but I would not recommend coming here if you're vegetarian or don't eat pork. The options will be pretty limited.,Place is surprisingly good, even for take out! Ordered this for the first time via DoorDash and Their soup dumplings hold up well and the skin isn't too thin where it breaks and the soup leaks out!Pan Fried Buns are also perfectly crispy on the bottom and full of flavor on the inside!We also ordered:Shanghainese sticky rice noodles - really good and flavorful - no complaints here!Savory Soy Milk - good since they separate the pieces but totally my fault for forgetting to add the vinegar myself (used it all for the soup dumplings, just wish they gave more packets of red vinegar)Sizzling Rice Soup - This didn't seem that worth it honestly, very little amount of soup for the cost so didn't feel like it was a good value, other items were better!The highlight was definitely the soup dumplings and pan fried buns so highly recommend everyone get this if they come here! I'm sure they taste even BETTER in person but take out is great too!,Came here for dinner on a Sunday and was lucky to come just before the rush! There's a Yelp waitlist that we saw upon arrival, but they were able to seat us right away. The food was SO good and at a very reasonable price point. ~~Parking: Street parking, but was able to snag a spot in the front of the restaurant. ~~Service: Great. Quick to seat, quick to order, and the food also didn't take very long to come out! ~~Best Part: Shanghai-Style Chow Mein & Pan Fried pot stickers.  I was surprised to see the pan fried pork buns, but was very happy to try it out! It's a little thicker than the ones that I've had in the past, but still very enjoyable. ~~Worst Part: Nothing. ~~Return: Definitely.,I've only gotten take out here, but the dumplings are amazing aka the crab and pork dumplings! I've gotten the chicken and corn soup as well as some noodz here but it was ok. The wait does take a while though.,The food is the usual dim sum food. Not sure what all the rave is about. We traveled quite far for this place so we expected more I guess. It's good if you live near by.,I was craving for some wontons... we ended up ordering everything BUT wontons! No ragretz. We got seated fairly quick, there was no wait, no lines. As time passed by, it got busier and busy with takeouts. Between the two Xiao Long Baos: Shanghai-Style Steamed Pork Dumplings (10) && Crab & Pork Steamed Dumplings (8). The latter is more flavorful and not too overwhelming. The Shanghai-Style Stir-Fried Rice Cake was my favorite, also because I love rice cakes! These were much thinner than what I was used to. For the Pea Sprouts w/ Garlic, they're more of the 「青」, light and refreshing side. We also got some soup on the side, the Beef and Cilantro. Pretty good, but ask for some pepper, IMO it tastes better with pepper. The service was pretty good, but it was a little bit difficult to flag someone down as there were only like 2-3 people serving. Note: they only take debit card or cash!,Was craving for XLB on a raining Saturday and since we need to be in this area for grocery shopping we decided to come here since there was no wait. We ordered  Shanghai style chow mein which was a little bit too salty for me but it was good; Shanghai-Style Pan-Fried Pork Buns (6) which was juicy and crispy; XLB was delicious and juicy and lastly sticky rice which was okay because could use a little more pork floss. This place can seat 49 people so once all seats are taken expect to wait so wait her come before the lunch crowd or come after. Since this place is busy staffs might not be as tentative as they should be so be patient with them. We waited close to 10 minutes and 3 asked to get someone's attention so we can get our check and boxes. Good thing we are not in a hurry so it was all good.,Complimentary tea was fabulous for those days that city is cloudy and drizzling.The portions are nice . I personally love the walnut prawns, the sauce was definitely worth of trying at least once. The service was fast and our server was super attentive.,Late night dumplings and noodles definitely hit the spot. Peanut noodles were good but I wish the sauce had more of a kick (nothing a little chili oil coulnd't fix though!). Soup dumplings were pretty standard and yummy but nothing too special. Service was great, the prices were as expected, and it wasn't busy at all. Would definitely stop by if I'm in the neighborhood again. Food: 7/10 Service: 7/10 Vibes: 5/10 Value: 7/10,What a magical find! My daughter had to pick something up from a store nearby and we happened into Dumpling Kitchen for lunch. We really enjoyed our meal (portions are enormous, so plan accordingly), especially the Shanghai-Style Pan-Fried Pork Buns (I can't describe this magic sufficiently...just order them); the only dish we'd not order again was the hot and sour soup (flavor was really flat). For a full restaurant, there were only two servers, but they *hustled* and we were served faster than most restaurants with 3x the staff. They allow you to join the waitlist from their website, too, so it's easy to get seated quickly if you are on your way.Is it fancy? No. Is it delicious? Yes. Will we be back? Absolutely!,Love this place! Yummy, reliable food- no wonder it's always packed. Came here with a big group, so we got to try many of the items on the menu. Everything came out with good pacing, with appetizer type items first, then the veggies and dumplings (steamed soup, pan fried, boiled) and then the glutinous rice dumpling in sweet rice wine dessert in a giant bowl. Favorite dish: Chilled spicy pig ear! I don't eat this often, but this is probably the best I've had. Will be back very soon!,Bit of a wait on a late Sunday afternoon, but good thing we joined the Yelp waitlist. I was excited for the food as the menu and pictures looked good, but was a bit disappointed. Sweet vinegar spareribs: I liked that there was a lot of white bone. Not really fried. Sauce not very good, doesn't taste vinegary, no flavor really and quite thick. Shanghai steamed pork dumplings: not a lot of soup, fairly large, okay overall. Shanghai chow mein: needed flavor, I mixed the sauce (chili oil + soy sauce + vinegar) on the table and it made a huge difference. Green onion pancake: doughy, not too greasy, needed salt, good amount of onion, slightly under friedShanghai pan fried dumplings: probably my favorite, fried well on the bottom, wrapping good, large Overall: Didn't have to wait much for the food. Decent price. Everything was lacking a bit of flavor. Probably won't come back, but I wanted to try something new.,Crab and pork xiao lo bans are to die for, super juicy inside and great flavor. Did not disappoint. Hot and sour soup had a great flavor also. Smokes fish was soooo flavorful , shrimp and pork shumais were too meaty and dense for me but my friend liked them. Very busy and crowded already at 5 pm ish. No problem with street parking. Service wasn't bad. Overall satisfied:-),Delicious authentic XLB and Chinese food place in the sunset district. The dumplings themselves are mid but the XLB AND FRIED BUNS slap!! Get them fresh and be careful cuz the soup inside is HOT. Shrimp fried rice - 4.5/5 super flavorful and aromatic, tastes just like home! Braised tofu and vegetables- 4/5 the tofu was soft and coated in egg, but wish the tofu was slightly more firm? Super good still and authentic. This place is comparable to the popular dumpling home  in Hayes valley. But with less of a wait and in a calm neighborhood. The baos are more savory than sweet, and the dough is a bit more sticky. Last time I got the eggplant and the green beans, which I don't remember being outstanding but you can't go wrong with the selection of Chinese dishes here!,Dumpling Kitchen has always been on my radar for a while and I've been wanting to come too! I've never actually eaten inside the restaurant, so I've been getting to go instead. Everything here was pretty good! I love dumplings in general so getting these were quite the treat. Of course getting these fresh in restaurant would be much better but even to-go they were still solid. First, the XLB's had a lot of soup in it and it was very tasty. Good proportions of soup and meat inside and it was very tender. Not featured in my photos, but I thought their Pan Fried Pork Buns were so good! I actually loved it. It was crispy on the outside and inside was meaty and juicy. It was a really good combination. The chicken and corn dumpling were an adventurous one for me, but I thought it was pretty good too. It wasn't anything to rave about, and it tastes exactly like how you would imagine it, but if you're feeling adventurous, give this a shot. Everything else I got was pretty standard but was good too. I would come back again! Whether if it's to-go or to dine in, I think this place is pretty solid. Will definitely come dine in next time for sure!,We ordered take out through Yelp and of order was ready when we got there. Are our favorites and we will order them again. Shanghai Chow MeinPan fried pot stickers Dry braised string beans,Amazing food!  The sheer number of dumplings was insane. They also had many of your normal Chinese food restaurant favorites, like Mongolian beef, sweet-and-sour, chicken, and the such.  The noodle dish that I had was spicy noodles in a peanut sauce, and it was so tasty, spicy, but not too spicy.  We also got the XLB, which is not listed like that, but I believe it was the Shanghai dumpling, it to was really goodWe join the Yelp waitlist, would certainly helped us get in faster.  From what I saw, the line appeared to be about 10 deep with people waiting for up to a half hour.Despite it being cold outside, it was well worth the wait.  The wait staff is extremely busy with the amount of volume happening so if you need something you better flag them down .,Came here yesterday after a haircut. The spicy wonton in chili oil was my least favorite because the sauce wasn't very special. However, the wontons were delicious.Loved the panfried buns although I wish the skin was less dough-y. Dry fried chicken is popular and pretty good. We also had XLBs that were pretty large (since I'm normally used to DTF size). All in all would def come back.Spent ~$75 for 2 people but we had sooo much leftover,When I'm craving Chinese food, this is where I go. My favorite dishes are their stir-fried rice cake and mu shu chicken. My husband and kids love their dumplings too, especially their pan-fried pork buns and steamed pork dumplings.,This restaurant has some amazing solid dumplings - I just wish I could try more items off their menu! My friend and I came here for a late lunch since we really wanted to try their dumplings. We ordered their Pan Fried Pork Buns and their Steamed Pork Dumplings. Both dishes were so tasty and juicy - the pan fried dumplings had a perfect crunchy bottom. I would definitely not hesitate to come back here again. Service here was so friendly and attentive despite a full house.,Having moved back to SF after a 10 year hiatus, I can't remember seeing so many dumpling restaurants. Perhaps I'm wrong but it feels this is something in high demand and I understand why. Just knowing that making dumplings is so time consuming you really have to appreciate when a place does it well and consistently. Came here right when they opened on a Saturday and it quickly got full and bustling. They offer you tea immediately upon being seated, which I really like (some Yelpers said they got roasted peanuts but it doesn't appear they offer those anymore). We ordered the XLBs (A1) and they were so delicate and juicy-truly wonderful. I could easily eat one order to myself. We also ordered the dry braised green beans and these were so flavorful and delicious I could not believe it! Definitely something to try. We also meant yo get the pan fried Shanghai dumplings but ended up ordering some pork pot stickers on accident (I think these were A3). Still really juicy and flavorful. Lastly, I wanted to try the chili wontons, which were okay. Not as flavorful as the others and really not spicy at all. Definitely would go back and may order some other non-dumpling dishes to try.,Came on a Friday night and there was no wait. We ordered the soup dumplings, green onion pancakes, pan fried pork buns, and string beans. The soup dumplings and string beans were def the standouts. The dumplings were juicy and the the string beans were super crunchy. I would pass on the green onion pancakes as they were pretty dry. Overall the food here is pretty good!,"I was up in SF and was told that Taraval Street is also known as the """"dumpling street"""". Out of all the restaurants", Dumpling Kitchen had the most hype so of course I had to check it out. We arrived at around noon on a Tuesday and there was no wait! These are the dishes we ordered and they were all made fresh to order. Pork XLB 5/5: I love a good soup dumpling, and these delivered. The skin is thicker than the typical Din Tai Fung, but I really enjoyed the texture and taste of this one. Shanghai Pan Fried Pork Buns 4/5: This was my first time trying this style of dumpling and it was pretty good. The bun itself was a lot of dough, but the filling was tasty.Wontons in Chili Oil 5/5: These were so good!! You get 10 huge wontons and they are doused in a Szechuan type chili sauce. I normally don't enjoy the Szechuan numbing pepper taste, but it was very mild here and the flavor of the wonton paired perfectly with it. Btw: these have a peanut allergy warning.String Beans 4/5: Your typical stir-fried string beans. The perfect crunch and flavor.Green Onion Pancake 3/5: This pancake was on the thicker side and was very filling so if you are trying to eat a lot of food here, I would probably not order this. Pork and Shrimp Shumai 2/5: I wouldn't order the shumai again. We are used to shumai from dim sum restaurants, so we were a little biased about the taste of this one. Overall, I think Dumpling Kitchen is a fantastic choice if you are looking for a dumpling spot in SF. The portions are generous and the food is freshly made.,The food was good but I had to deduct 2 stars because the XLB had no soup inside.  How can that be!?!?,Food is good but they have questionable business practices. They used to accept credit cards and I remember they for sure did when I last came in February. The lady at the counter in February told me she couldn't accept my Amex but could accept Visa, so I gave her a Visa. I came in today and attempted to pay with Visa only to be told that they only accept Visa debit or cash. While waiting to pick up my order, I watched a guy pay at the counter with a credit card. If you're coming for takeout and don't have debit or cash, you *might* have to place a pickup order on Uber Eats and pay a surcharge, or avoid this place altogether.,Haven't been in a few years but came with a friend for dinner. The dumplings, XLBs n Pan-Fried are still winners which were juicy and very flavorful. Only thing, need to eat pretty fast or won't taste the same when cold.  Rice cakes were as expected and wings had a little herbal flavor not sure if five spice or other strong flavor to it Service was efficient and friendly with no lines tonight Will be back,Definitely one of the best meals I've had in SF (and maybe ever)! The food is so fresh, high quality, and of course delicious. I really recommend trying the soup dumplings, the broth is incredibly flavorful! The pan fried Shanghai-style dumplings were also really good. To top it off for dessert, you have to get salted egg yolk bao, I literally dream of the next time I will go back and eat this soft, warm and perfectly sweet bun. Everyone who works there is incredibly kind and helpful. I went with just one friend, but there are plenty of large tables for bigger groups.,Absolutely do not recommend this place. Decided to come here due to the good reviews and how close it was to our airbnb. We ordered to-go here and our order was ready in about 10 minutes. They didn't give any utensils which I didn't realize till we got back to our airbnb. I asked for some chili oil and they gave me one container with barely anything in it and it was different than the chili oil they gave me for the wontons. Wontons in chili oil - did not have good flavor and were extremely thick. Shanghai XLB - also did not have good flavor and barely had any soup in them, was the only item that was hot.Spare ribs - was room temperature which made it not enjoyable. We spent $40 dollars on this meal and it was definitely not worth it. They state they only accept debit cards/cash, pretty sure it's because they don't want to pay the extra fee. I had a discover debit card which they ended up not accepting but did end up taking my visa credit card.,We decided to have lunch here yesterday, after our drive from Carmel. I was craving dumplings. And this spot definitely fulfilled my cravings. It was a busy lunch hour but the staff were so quick and very friendly.We ordered a few items.1. Kung Pao Chicken - Hubby loved it so much.2. Shrimp and pork dumplings - really filing and so flavorful.3. Wontons in chili sauce - loved this.4. Beef stew noodle soup - big bowl this is for 2 people. Loved the noodles and the braised beef. So delicious.Definitely a must visit if you happen to be in SF. Highly recommend!,Ordered: 2 XLBS, salted egg Baos, stir fried rice cakes, dry chicken over rice Wait time: used waitlist on Yelp during lunch peak time (Sunday), didnt have to wait at all even if they were packed Service: fast and efficient Ambiance: casual Price: fair and reasonable Tip: debit card and cash only WIGBA (would I go back again): absolutely,Great spot in the sunset for dumplings! Most known for the XLB (Shanghai-Style Steamed Pork Dumplings) and Shanghai-Style Pan-Fried Pork Buns, these did not disappoint. Flavors were delicious in those first bites and the dumpling skin didn't break when I picked them up. You must eat them while they're fresh and steaming hot because they taste so much better. That's why it's hard to get dumplings for takeout because it gets soggy in the box and doesn't taste the same. Other popular dishes include their wontons in chili oil, rice cakes, and chow mein. There is also the Yelp Waitlist at Dumpling Kitchen, so we didn't have to wait long for a table.  Good service, decent prices, and yummy food.,Yum yum yum! The food here was so good! If you're visiting SF you have to come here for some delicious dumplings!The four of us ordered so much food and it was all so good and great sharing portions. I don't remember everything we ordered but all the soup dumplings came out steaming hot. We ordered some chow mein, green beans and eggplant, too. We ordered the pan fried dumplings and it never came out :') but I'm not even mad cause I was stuffed but I hope to come back soon and get some pan fried dumplings. I was amazed at how quick all the food came out. We had to eat quick to make room on our small table cause we ordered so much. Lol.Quick note, make sure to join the waitlist on Yelp to save time. We didn't join the waitlist until we arrived and waited about 40 ish mins? (Hint: go across the street for drinks while you wait).Come here on a empty tummy so you can eat up and food coma :),Not a fan would not return. Table was dirty and dumplings were overly moist. Also, I kept on asking for a napkin because they gave me one each time I would not recommend. Not sure what the hype is about this place.,I had high hopes for this place and it just kind of ended up be disappointing and lackluster. The dumplings were just okay, I waited a long time for my to go order.,Good neighborhood dumpling place with good variety of choices... I would recommend this place if you are craving dumplings,A hidden hole in the wall! Came across this restaurant while driving through SF, and saw that there was a short line. After seeing other reviews, we had to try it! You're able to join the waitlist directly on Yelp which made it easier to get a table. - Crab & Pork Soup dumplings (3.5/5): I was intrigued about the crab mixture, but found that I didn't get much Crab flavour. The soup based was flavourful, but still felt like a regular soup dumpling.- Pork Soup Dumpling (4/5): What I really came here for! The soup base was tasty and the filling to wrap ratio was perfect, which made it easy to eat. It was the best kind of comfort food.- Shrimp Dumpling (5/5): The key is to ask for red vinegar on the side to dip the dumpling in. Sadly these came with only 4 per order. However, they were still just as tasty and my favourite thing to order. - Pan Fried Pork Dumpling (5/5): This was commonly ordered at this restaurant, so we had to try it! If you've ever been to Toronto's Juicy Dumpling -- this is the equivalent but much larger in size and not as oily! It had a chewy dough texture with the perfect ratio of filling and soup. I'd definitely order this again.The service was quite standard, not too long of a wait but not extremely fast either. The staff was really friendly and accommodating and even offered to split our bill evenly. The interior is a little small, hence a hole in the wall, but was cozy with tables for small and large groups!,Although this place is called Dumpling Kitchen, it feels more like a Chinese Restaurant that also serves dumplings. Their noodles have good balance of flavors, and go for their wings.  Their dumpling was nice, but the skin is on the thicker side of other places, and the pork had a unique after taste. Their onion cake is on the thicker side, and one piece can be quite filling. Their greens are tasty and comparable to their fancy counterparts.  The Clay Pot rice didn't have the char burnt taste you expect from cooking in a clay pot (it felt more as if the rice should've cooked with more high heat to get the burnt rice on the bottom and side).,3/28/22My family has NEVER been here, so it was a great discovery. :)Quality/Quantity -They make the dumplings fresh here in front of you, see pictures.Shanghai Style Stir Fried Rice Cake - Similar to the Korean Rice Cake, we could have eaten more of this!Shanghai Style Steamed Pork Dumplings - Made fresh here.Shanghai Style Pan Fried Pork Buns - Made fresh here.Five spice Beef Stew Noodles - Good, but you can get this at almost all the local restaurants.Braised Pork Belly with Preserved Vegetables - BACON style, always good, but I need to limit my quantity.Dry Fried Chicken Wings - Another hit.Sweet Vinegar Spare Ribs - Wow, our first time trying this dish, I am told it is very different from how they make it in Shanghai, but it was still good. I will reorder just in case today it was not cooked per recipe.Atmosphere - Small local restaurant.Street parking - Again we are in San Francisco, so good luck.Interesting that they have an employee and customer restroom, but NO one seems to follow the signs, so a free for all?Service - They forgot one of our dishes but still charged us, but it worked out well as we were already full when we discovered their mistake. They easily corrected the bill.Price - $102.20 + Tip.Cash onlyOwner Suggestion - Congrats on all your success. Your first Yelp review is from 2010 and we are just discovering you now...Are you one of 3 locations? SF, Berkeley and Foster City? I look forward to coming back and trying all your other dishes.,This is for the take out. Soup dumplings had no soup :(. Beijing noodles salty. Don't get take out. Maybe it will be better dine in otherwise not sure what the hype is all about.,Came with some friends on a Saturday night. It was a little crowded when we got there, so we had to wait a bit before being seated even though we joined the yelp waitlist.We ordered the steamed pork dumplings, pan-fried pork buns, stir-fried rice cake, and soy milk. The steamed pork dumplings were okay. The skin was a little too thick, and they weren't as hot as they should have been, but the meat and soup had a pretty good flavor. The pan-fried pork buns were the best thing we ate, and maybe the only thing worth coming to this restaurant for. They were fried and crispy on the bottom without being too oily, and there was a good portion of flavorful soup on the inside. One of the better ones that I've tried!The stir-fried rice cake dish was decent. It had good flavor, but the rice cakes themselves didn't have the bounce that a good rice cake should have. The pork and cabbage that came with the rice cake dish tasted good though. The soy milk had a very light flavor to it, so don't order this if you're expecting a strong soy milk taste.The food was generally decent, but it also got cold really quickly, which caused the various sauces to congeal as we were eating. Not super appetizing, but it still tasted fine. I think it's because the food didn't come out hot, just warm (not sure if that's a result of food sitting out, or them using a microwave..?). Anyways, just something to note.The service was straightforward, and the waitstaff refilled our tea throughout the meal.Parking is a little tricky, but there is street parking around.Overall, a decent meal. I'd come back only for the pan-fried pork buns, which were a 5/5. But the mediocrity of the other dishes brings this place down to a 3/5.,We got take out here.  Xiao long bao 10 for $11 is a good deal and yummy.   Salt and pepper fish not spicy was yummy.  I think $16.  Hot and sour soup not that good.  They added red hot sauce which is not authentic. Overall the first two makes it still a good place to order from again.,I've been on a mad hunt for wonton soup ever since my favorite place closed in Marin! Their dumplings were great, but the wontons were too doughy. The meat inside was flavorful though. When I stopped to pick up my to-go order the place was packed for lunch time! That's always a good sign, so I'd like to give it another go, but maybe eat in-house.,Really good dim sum here!! Chowmein : 5/5 noodles are thick and delicious with the chili sauce!!! Pan fried pork buns: 5/5 I had them the next day and they were still so good!! Pork dumplings: 5/5 very light and juicy,Stopped by on a Friday night and there was a small wait but nothing too crazy. We ordered the Shanghai soup dumplings, stir fried rice cakes, and the fried chicken.The soup dumplings were great! It was full of soup and the meat was flavorful as well 5/5.The stir fried rice cakes had good flavor but the rice cakes were a bit over cooked and a bit too soft. Almost melting in the mouth instead of the chewy texture that I prefer 4/5.The fried chicken is probably something that can be skipped because the flavor wasn't amazing. They were just fried chicken in a sweet sauce that was a bit overpowering 3/5.Overall would definitely come back but stick to the standard dumplings and noodles instead.,Haven't been here for a long time ..what happened to this place? Really loud & food all gone downhill onion pancake was thick & cake-like with no flavor (Trader Joe's frozen ones are better), hot & sour soup tasted like spicy tomato, spicy wontons had super thick skin & used same chili oil as soup, rice roll had chewy chinese donut inside. (should be crispy) Not the authentic dishes we used to get here,THIS PLACE WAS SO GOOD!!! I've tried all the Dumpling [fill in the blank] like Dumpling time, home, etc. in SF, and this place tops it all off. Shanghai-Style Pan-Fried Pork Buns (5/5) -- this was my favorite dish we got! Unlike other dumpling places, they make it super crispy and it doesn't feel super fried. Definitely get this.Won-ton chili oil (3/5) -- I felt like it wasn't as flavorful compared to Din Tai Fung, but it was still good. My friend LOVES it.Xiao Long Bao (4/5) -- this was good as well! It wasn't as memorable as the other dishes, but it's a staple to every dumpling restaurant I go to so I just had to try it.Noodles with Peanut Sauce (5/5) -- This was SO GOOD!!! If you love peanut sauce, this dish is for you. They gave us so much. I ate leftovers of this the next day and it was still so good.,Cute hidden gem in San Francisco. First, you will want to check in on the waitlist on yelp before you head on over.  On arrival, we were greeted and told our table would be ready shortly. We were sat at a nice round table with a lazy Susan which I wish more places would adopt since there were 5 of us and we orders family style. We tried the following:Chicken egg flower soup 8/10 needed a little salt Pot stickers: 9/10 (more liked steamed but were delicious) Combo fried rice: 10/10 (everyone raved about this) Steamed Shrimp and pork Shumai: 9/10Shanghai-Style Pan-Fried Pork Buns: 8/10 (a little too doughy but flavorful) Steamed Shrimp Har Gow: 9/10Overall, we loved this place! We will definitely be back and try more things.,First timer ordering takeout:*  Shanghai-style pan-fried pork buns*  Beef Cilantro soup*  Sautéed garlic bok Choi Place was packed when I picked up my order at 2PM on Sunday. Ordering was seamless, food was hot and tasty. Pork buns were flavorful and juicy to the bite. Bok Choi was a good accompaniment to the baos. Soup was hot and great for a cold gray day. Packaging was well done. No leaks. Food was great. Wished they packed the baos with some chili oil or black vinegar  instead of the prepackaged red vinegar. Will be back somehow. Only complaint is there was nowhere to park to pick up my order. Taraval Street seems to be all red curbs or driveways. It was either park in someone's driveway or what I did. Park at the hydrant and run in fast. Wish they had curbside delivery.,Another round of sticky rice roll , as usual it taste so good .  I visited this restaurant during lunch time and notice lots of people picked up togo food, this restaurant must be popular in Sunset area .,We where visiting from Arizona, at home we don't have lots of places that do serve vegan dumplings and buns. This place is very welcoming. Food is so good we didn't want to leave. They have so many vegan options I was tempted to try every single vegan item on the menu. As everywhere in San Francisco it is hard to find a parking spot around this restaurant, but the food is worth your effort ! According to other family members none vegan food is also delicious !,Amazing little gem of a restaurant. I came on the recommendation of a neighboring business and it did not disappoint.   Highlight for me was watching the dumplings being made by hand.  The dumplings were huge and fresh. I have been back twice now and have the same excellent experience.Recommend to try the dumplings and the steamed buns in a first visit.  Also the Wonton Soup was amazing with the huge wontons.  Try the vegetable fried rice as a complement to your meal.Be prepared during peak hours there will be a line to get in.   Worth the wait,First time here... has been on my bookmarks for a while and wow!! Did not disappoint. These had to be some of the best I've had in the Bay Area. The service was very quick and very clean. The pricing was great, I just should've known to not go solo. Usual servings for dim sum baskets but I had to try at least a few things. End up with the pork and cabbage dumplings, Shanghai style steamed soup dumplings, and the hot and sour soup. Was perfect for a cold wet San Francisco day. Can't wait to go to the other locations with more people so we can try even more.,Haven't came here for a long time. Finally, we came back but the menu changed, that's mean owner changed. Bingo! The guy who helped us took our orders said back to two years ago owner changed. Customer service ~ hmm... no expectation, just only two people working front and back Steam dumplings still juicy and tasty.Eggplants and Ribs also taste good but the Vegetables Mu Shu was not that good, the worst was the fried eggs in the dish, so dried, hard to swallow. You had to take it out. At least, they checked your vaccine card and no extra charges on the bill.,Combination fried rice: Awesome!! Steamed custard bun: Awesome!!Fried green onion pancake: Awesome!!Fried XLB: I'm not sure what all the rave is about. I thought they were bland and needed soy sauce and/or vinegar & ginger.Steamed XLB: same thingConsidering XLB seems the main reason for coming here, I'm giving an average rating.,Great food! Dumplings and buns are must-gets here. I tried the following:- Shanghai-style steamed pork dumplings - really amazing--probably my favorite dish here so far if I had to pick one, but everything was good here! The pork meat in the dumplings was very juicy, and the soup was steaming hot and so flavorful. They might be one of the best pork soup dumplings I've ever had actually. - Shanghai-styled pan-fried pork buns - I don't eat a lot of those buns, but they seemed to be popular here, so I wanted to give them a try. I thought they were good, but my friend *especially* went crazy over them. The bun texture was thick, doughy-soft, and firm. Again, the pork meat inside was steaming hot and super juicy and flavorful. - Mu shu with pork - delicious and flavorful as well. The flour wrappers were warm and soft, yet also firm and just slightly crispy on the outside. Gotta love when bread/wrappers have perfect texture!  - Eggplant with garlic sauce - solid classic dish- Chocolate lava xiao long baos - wow, they were incredibly amazing and delicious!!! I was skeptical of how well chocolate might pair with steamed buns (and wondering if this combination would ruin my fond nostalgic memories of traditional pork dumplings I had growing up). However, I have to say I was impressed... The chocolate was dark and rich (and rather reminiscent of Nutella), and it blended smoothly and warmly with the steamed bun bread. Good quick service.,Shrimp fried rice: tasty wok flavor with 10-12 little shrimpSalt and pepper fish fillets: kind of soggy and the fish may not have been completely cooked. Decent garlic flavorGreen beans: good garlic flavor but a little overdone Shanghai style noodles: meh Portions were on the smaller side and there was some broccoli in the serving plates.,FYI. Orders through yelp do not work according to the staff. If youd like to place online orders you would have to use one of the other 3rd party services.!! My thoughts on these are all based on take on !! - San Francisco has a mandatory vaccine mandate.  I don't really have the taste for good Dim Sum yet, but I did enjoy what I ate here. The Shumai and the Har gow were good, and surprisingly big, I'm not sure if I have just always had really small pieces before but I liked the size upgrade. As for the dumplings, they were good. I've had some better one's else where but I just did not find myself enjoying that much. They might be better fresh since I brought them back to my hotel to eat. The fried rice was actually pretty good. It was for my mom so I tried not to eat it all but it goes well with the Dim Sum!For Dessert I ordered the Beijing Sweet buns, I was expecting some sort of paste inside but it was just a bun sadly. But, the rice bun was good! I'll actually have to go back and dine in once the vaccine mandate has lifted!One of the locals nearby said that her husband loves the soup and practically eats it all the time so maybe thats something that I'd recommend trying even though I havent.,Came here for lunch on a weekday because of the Yelp rating and reviews. Got the Shanghai style pan fried dumplings that everyone posted about, plus the green onion pancake, and hot and sour soup. Food wasn't the best. Won't be back.,This place is small but the food is delicious! There wasn't a single item we ordered that we did not enjoy,The food is so good we got the steamed pork dumplings with shrimp, the pan fired pork dumpling, and Shanghai-style steamed pork dumpling and the Chow mein and Mongolian beef. Everything was super tasty. Definitely recommend.,Decided to take my mom out for lunch and this restaurant popped up on yelp. The inside was kinda small and really clean. My mom and I were both really hungry so we ordered the Shanghai-style pan fried pork buns, Shanghai-style chow mein and the steamed dumplings.My-oh-my, the pan fried pork buns were ah-mazing. They were nice and juicy on the inside and crispy AF on the bottom. The chow mein was out-of-this-world. It was a tad bit too salty for me but it's all good. The steamed dumplings were good, too, but the chow mein and pork buns stood out the most. Everyone was extremely kind too. They made sure we were doing ok and kept checking up on us. I will most definitely come back when I'm around the area.,Stopped by here on a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch around 3pm. We were immediately seated and handed menus. We ordered the following items: - Shanghai Style Steamed Pork Dumplings (3.5/5): The wrapping was thin and the flavor was good; however, all our soup dumplings were lacking soup inside. This was a huge disappointment for me because my favorite part of eating XLB is drinking the soup from each little dumpling. - Shanghai Style Pan-Fried Pork Buns (4/5): These were good, full of soup and flavor. I can see why they're so popular, but I personally don't prefer them just because there is so much fried dough at the bottom of each dumpling. - Shanghai Style Chow Mein (4.5/5): This was much better than expected! The sauce was flavorful and paired well with the noodles and meat. I only wished that the noodles were chewier - they seemed a bit overcooked/soft and was lacking the chewiness and bite that I prefer to have in my noodles. - Dry-Braised String Beans (5/5): This was surprisingly our favorite! The string beans were so tasty, not too oily, and had a nice crunch to them. Definitely recommend this dish. Overall, I'd give this restaurant a solid 3.5/5 stars, but rounded up to 4 for yelp. I don't know if I'd come here again for the XLB since they were so dry and had no soup in them. All the other dishes we tried were solid and would satisfy your Chinese food cravings.,Delicious, feels like being fed by a family. Had veggie fried rice, moo shy pork, spicy oil wontons, and green beans. All were excellent. Looking forward to trying more things next time!,Great food and service. Wait time is better since you can sign in online. Every dish was spectacular!,Nice little dimsum restaurant with quite a lot of seating inside. No wait on a weekend afternoon and service was great. Food came out quickly and taste was great. The steamed dimsum are not filled with soup, but still very good. Pan fried dumplings are probably the highlight here. Chicken wings were not crispy but very flavorful. Overall would come again!,One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the city. The first time we ate here was indoors. I love their food! The second time, we ordered to go. When my son picked up the food and came home, they gave him the wrong order! So back he went and there was another customer with the same name. Our order was still there and the guy behind the desk told us we could keep the wrong order for free! What a treat! Anyway, tonight we ordered combination fried rice, pea shoots, Mongolian beef, mu shu pork (they forgot the hoisin sauce), har gow dim sum, pork dim sum and chicken and corn soup. Their dim sums are massive. All were delish. Never fails.,One of the best dumpling places in San Francisco. I recommend joining their waitlist ahead of time so you won't have to wait when you arrive. The food came out really fast and the service was good. I got the pan-fried noodles and it was a nice experience. They use different noodles than other Chinese restaurants. I love their soup dumplings (not in photos), they were tasty and juicy. Their pan fried pork buns were also amazing and tasty. This is my second time coming here and everything I had so far was really good. If you ever crave dumplings or Chinese food, this is the place!,Superb dumplings and Chinese food! I'm not from the area so it doesn't take much to impress me on dim sum style restaurants. The menu was quite extensive and I think would satisfy any dietary needs. The service was great, food came out fast. The Cucumber Salad was outstanding! It had such a nice savory and garlic flavor. We also got Har Gow and the veggie shumai, both were delicious. The Shanghai style stir fried rice cakes were good, I like that the sauce wasn't too overpowering.,Dumpling Kitchen has remodeled since we last went there before the pandemic.  The place is bright, spacious, and clean.  The employees all wore masks and gloves and asked for proof of vaccination.Tea, plates, bowls, chopsticks, dipping sauces for dumplings quickly brought to the table by the young, polite, trilingual (Mandarin, Cantonese and English) staff.Two-sided laminated menu showed numerous choices in addition to having weekday lunch specials (8 rice plates) and frozen dumplings (3 - 50 piece choices).We chose:- XLB (10 pieces, no skin breaks or soup leaks, came out very hot, grab from the top, be careful although I wish it had a little more soup inside)- Fried Pork Buns (6 buns, also very hot with lots of soup inside, nice crunchy texture on the outside)- Dry Fried Chicken Wings (still think that  the San Tung version is the best)- Beijing Style Black Bean Noodles (not the dark Ja Jiang Mein that I was hoping for)- Hot Sweet Soy Bean DrinkWe liked the first two items the best.Get here early as the place fills up quickly.  We liked the service with the younger trilingual adults working the front.,After seeing all the good reviews about this place, I decided to give it a try with my boyfriend, but much to our disappointment all the dishes we got were mediocre or below par (2 stars). Service was okay. - The green onion pancake was dry & flavorless, the pork dumplings had so much skin compared to the little filling it had. - The mapo tofu was straight up painful, not even the enjoyable spice!! - The only thing that were okay were the chili wontons & shang hai dumplings (comparable to the frozen ones at the store)Overall, would not come back due to the quality of the foods for their prices ): there are better dumpling places in the sunset!!,Got takeout from this place on a Saturday evening. We ordered green onion pancakes, chicken fried rice and veggie hot and sour soup. Everything was so delicious. We placed an order over the phone and the person taking the order was very patient and sweet. Our order was ready in 20 minutes. Would love to dine in here sometime for their fresh dumplings.Pro tip: they only accept cashPS: We were so hungry and the food looked so delicious that I forgot to take any pictures :),We love these dumplings and every dish we have tried, too!!! Every year we get dim sum for Thanksgiving and Christmas and this the best we have tried in San Francisco. Service is fast and friendly considering how busy they are. It's always clean! Definitely recommend joining the waiting list on Yelp if you plan on going during a busy time. Also, parking can be tricky, just a heads up.,First time at Dumpling Kitchen and I was surprised. Sometimes it's hit or miss with dumping places. Chicken wings were ok but really saltyGreen beans were good, crunchy and not too soggyShanghai chow mein were good, yummy chewey noodlesPan fried dumplings-these were surprisingly good, soup inside and nice crunchy exterior Pork xlb: juicy goodneszService was arightIndoor dining available No outdoor dining available,There are many Shanghainese dumpling houses in Parkside, but the pan-fried pork buns on the menu here caught our eyes. Crispy and crunchy on the bottom, the balls open up to a juicy interior. The popular dish here came out quickly first, and it was almost gone before other wrapped goods are here.The xiao long bao would be tastier with more broth, and the wonton in chili oil was heavy on the mala numbing and doesn't taste enough in the hot side. But the insides of the wontons were large and meaty, great to soak up the chili oil in bites!,This is the best dumpling place I have ever tried. Not only are their Shanghai style panfried dumplings authentic and delicious, their stir fry dishes are also very flavorful. Highly recommend!,Holy shit this place is soooooo good. The chef makes mala/sichuanese dishes really good in addition to traditional hong kongese and Shanghainese dishes. We ordered the Husband Wife beef (it's a cold appetizer for all y'all white folks), hot sour soup, shanghai dumplings and steamed dumplings. Every dish was phenomenal, and honestly I left feeling so full and satisfied. We waited like 5-10 mins to be seated on a Sunday night. Would 1000% recommend.,Loved it. Neighborhood dumpling spot with a varied menu of awesomeness. Casual. The vinegar spareribs were a standout as were the soup dumplings. The Siu main is great but my favorite dish was the fried pork bun. Familiar but also kind of extra.,Oh my god dumpling kitchen is place that I think about often and am sad that I live in the opposite direction of it in the city which makes going here a special occasion. But these dumplings are the freshest XLB and pan fried pork dumplings I have ever had.. their dumpling wrappers are so soft and taste homemade. The pork fillings are SO JUICY. And not just the for the XLB! Their dumplings all together are the best of the best with it tasting so fresh and cozy and hottttt out of the steamer. Although there are other popular dumpling spots in the city that are closer I will always choose dumpling kitchen...,After exploring Land's End and Sutro Baths with my mom and aunt, we were hungry for dumplings. Not many places in the area were still open when we were looking around 2pm on a weekday, so when I pulled up Yelp, Dumpling Kitchen fit the bill (also, I saw a Yelp picture with Ali Wong on it, so I knew Dumpling Kitchen had to be good! Just kidding. Sort-of.) I liked how you can see the dumplings being made and they have multiple fans running inside--felt safe during COVID times.We shared - Green Bok Choy w/ Garlic--fresh and good.- Crab & Pork Steamed Dumplings--a bit more fishy than expected. Wouldn't get this again but not bad.- Shanghai-Style Steamed Pork Dumplings--good broth, inconsistent amount of pork in each dumpling. Good skin.- beef noodle soup--very simple, good for the soul, warmed our hearts. Flavorful broth from the beef. My 98yo grandmother devoured the leftovers.TL;DR: affordable and yummy. I will be back for their frozen dumplings and also to try their Shanghai pan fried pork buns which my mom and aunt did not wish to order.,I didnt have any expectations for this restaurant, i thought it was going to be average, but their food is actually really delicious. Good portions for its size in SF. These shanghai pan fried pork buns are probably the best ones ive had in cali. The noodles were good but extremely filling. Wonton in chili oil had a nice taste but i wish the wrapper was thinner and softer - the wrapper was definitely not cooked all the way in the mid section.,This place is definitely a hidden gem. The food is so good we got the steamed pork dumplings with shrimp, the pan fired pork dumpling, Shanghai-style steamed pork dumpling and the Chow mein and Mongolian beef. The sauce on the Mongolian beef is delicious you will want to dip your dumplings in it I give it a 10/10 for sure. I picked up the food and the restaurant was very busy, it showed right away this place was not going to disappoint. Definitely recommend.,Came here based on my friend's recommendation. Seemed like it was a pretty popular place it was bustling on the inside and there was a line forming outside. My friend and I got the XLB, Stir-fried String Beans, Shanghai Rice Cakes, and the Wontons in Chili Oil (not pictured). For the most part, all of the dishes did not disappoint. The XLB were pretty generously filled and had a good amount of soup in each one. I would say that they are comparable to the ones at Din Tai Fung. The stir-fried string beans were pretty standard but tasty nonetheless. The Shanghai rice cakes were cooked and seasoned well. The only dish that me and my friend were not fond of was the Wontons in Chili Oil. I thought that these were going to be sweet and spicy, but it was more of a mala-type spice which I was not expecting. All the dishes were delicious, generously portioned, and pretty affordable. Can't wait to come again and try more dishes!One thing to note is that it seems like they are bit under staffed so it may be difficult to flag down a waiter at times, but I'm not surprised since many restaurants have struggled with this during the pandemic. Just be mindful and patient - they're trying their best!! :),Over hyped place with alright dishes...This place was hyped more than it really should be. All the dishes were alright, but the pan fried Shanghai dumplings (A5) was the best. That's the only dish I'd recommend out of the 3.,Soup dumplings and bbq boa were solid. Quick service and clean establishment. We were a little thrown off by the bug zapper, but glad they are doing something about it. If I were a local I could see visiting here often.,Came for one thing only: the pan fried buns. There were only two tables seated when we got there at 5:30pm, though I did put myself on the waitlist on the way here just in case (didn't seem like they used the waitlist function though). Have your vax card ready to show them at the door. Food: You must get the Shanghai pork dumplings and the Shanghai pan fried pork buns. Both were super juicy and came pipping hot (make sure you cool down the soup!). I would come back just for the pan fried pork buns, the bottom was super crispy and it had just enough filling and the perfect amount of dough. Both goes very well with the vinegar, wish they were more generous with the ginger slices. Wontons in chili oil was not what we expected (don't expect the ones you get from Din Tai Fung). The oil in this one was more orange and was more numbing than spicy. Last thing we got was the combination fried rice. It was the typical fried rice you'd expect from a Chinese restaurant, nothing very special but a tasty staple dish to fill everyone up. Parking: Easy to find parking in residential area," if you're lucky you might find some spots along Taraval!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That's My Jam,"I was about to visit this place before 2022 ends but they were closed. So I included this place on my bucket list of the places to visit in the Western Addition. This place is definitely my jam! The staff are very welcoming and friendly. The interiors of the place is very clean and has some indie vibe of the place's setting. Everything is very pleasant.I ordered a tuna sandwich and a mocha. I didn't realize the sandwich comes with some salad on the side. They all seem nutritious. A lady, who I assume to be the owner, kept asking me how was my mocha. I said it was perfectly fine. She seemed delighted from my response.I'd definitely be back. I strongly recommend this place to anyone visiting the NoPa/Western Addition area. I just wish they'd be open more days.,It is with great sadness that I write this review of one star. I haven't even had a chance to give you a proper rating because I have not, as of yet been able to experience your establishment. I live two blocks away, I have tried going to your place during the day -during the week - on the weekends - during the morning - in the evening, yet I can never seem to find when you're open. It's sad because it looks like a lovely place. I love nice wine and I love nice accoutrements, and I probably would've spent way too much money enjoying all your offerings. Best of luck. With love, Your neighbor.,Best restaurant on divisadero by far until I write my next review! Came here on a break from yoga teacher training where we were learning all about the fear of death and how to overcome it. God, that fear is strong for me. But when I took a bite of the most perfectly seasoned breakfast sandwich on the most incredible French baguette? You know I forgot all about the ticking clock and how it struts and paces ahead of us. The oozing egg, the creamy avocado, the perfect balance of ingredients. It made one of my wrinkles disappear. The Niçoise salad is a standout as well! The salmon tasted unlike any other salmon I've had. It was tender and flavorful and perfectly cooked. I imagined the salmon in its last moments on earth, and how afraid it must have felt, and then I felt a wave of peace as I imagined it would have volunteered itself to the hook if it knew it would be part of this perfect dance of vegetables and dressing.There's an incredible dog here named Twiggy that has the poise beyond anything 100 annoying yoga teacher trainees combined could muster. It seems like he owns the place, and he owns it well. The human owners are also so charming and lovely that I hope they never do succumb to the eternal sleep that we all are destined for. They have too much incredible food and drink to give this world!,Came by on a Sunday morning around 9:30am and was seated immediately on the patio. We got the breakfast sandwich ($16) +  bacon ($3) and the dual grilled cheese ($16). The grilled cheese was our waitress's favorite and it was mine too! It melts right in your mouth and is just so satisfying. The salad addition was a nice lighter touch, although it had too much herbs for my taste. The breakfast sandwich was good too, but I will say a bit pricy for the size. I would have still been hungry if I had ate just that. The yogurt was a bit too sweet for me, I wish it was greek or something more tart and less sweet.Overall, service was friendly, but I will say a bit pricey for the portion sizes- though I do know food costs are high in general right now. Cute little neighborhood spot though!,Sweet spot on Divisidero, That's my Jam is it! Gorgeous parklet and indoor restaurant. Great food too! We had the grilled cheese, beet salad and bacon quiche. Delish. The grilled cheese was full of cheese and lovely tomatoes and perfectly grilled bread - it wasn't greasy and cooked to perfection. The quick was fluffy, almost like a soufflé. Well balanced flavors and not too dense. Beet salad was great too. They also have  lattes in many flavors, $5 IPAs and $10 mimosa's made both in our party happy. Looking forward to trying the breakfast sandwich! Sorry I didn't take more food photos. I was too busy eating it!Waitstaff were great!,Love this place. Best outdoor seating on Divis - gorgeous wooden booths. The lavender latte and breakfast sandwiches are delicious, and the staff are warm and friendly.,We had our holiday party here and the service and food was outstanding! Like the brunch was so unique and out of this world. I'm so excited to come back and sit outside at the parklet! Cheers to small businesses!,Really good place! It's very cute and the iced vanilla latte was one of the best I've had. This place is on the pricier side but it's super high quality and run by some really nice people. You get what you pay for!! Amazing addition to the neighborhood!!,This is one of my favorite new brunch spots in town.The staff is super friendly and fun, and the food is shockingly good - some of the best Eggs Benedict and quiche that I've had.I'm happy that I discovered this place before it got super popular. Also, I hope this place gets super popular; they deserve it.,Really great breakfast sandwich. It's an explosion of flavors and they have champagne if you want to start your weekend properly.,I crave their turmeric latte!  We did a company holiday brunch and it was delicious and fun. The avocado toast, Eggs Benedict and quiche were standouts for me - oh, and too much delicious bacon and mimosas!  :).  The interior is welcoming and cool and the parket is wonderful. One of my favorite spots in the city for brunch!  Whether you are doing a company event or want to stop by for a breakfast sandwich or latter - you'll be happy.,I feel lucky to have found this place as I was walking hungrily along Divis, considering the same options I've been visiting for years.  It really is like a breath of fresh air.The food is flavorful, fresh, and full of unique combinations that work unexpectedly well together, like the avocado mash and plantain fried rice.  I've also really enjoyed the desserts and I don't even have a sweet tooth!  The chef creates a delicious new creme brûlée every few weeks.  So far I've tried the pumpkin spice and the rosemary.  Both were not too subtle, and not too strong, but just right.  I also had the poached pear.  If the holidays had a flavor, this would be it - spiced and warm and comforting.  I also keep coming back because of the staff.  They are genuinely kind, attentive, and welcoming.  They make me feel like I'm at my favorite neighborhood place.,I'm so glad this place opened on Divis. The owners are warm, inviting, and genuinely want you to love everything you try there. Their coffee is delicious and the food has never disappointed. The eggs Benedict we tried was one of the best we've had in the city -- the hollandaise was so fresh!! The only downside is that they are only open Friday to Sunday at the moment -- can't wait for weekday service.,This place is unbelievable!!! I highly highly recommend visiting this local gem. When I describe it to friends, I often just say it's a place where every single ingredient, regardless of the item, is the best form of that ingredient that you have ever had. Nadia, the host, is so kind and welcoming. The location is beautiful. It is my single favorite restaurant I've been to in San Francisco.  I first visited That's My Jam in early 2020 when they opened as a breakfast place. No exaggeration, hands-down the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. I had my first dinner there last Friday (late November 2021) and it was better than I could have possibly expected. The crostini was the best I'd ever had. The Ahi tuna was the best I'd ever had. The sushi was the best I'd ever had. If you are looking for a special meal in San Francisco, I could not recommend this place enough.,Lots of specialty food and highly qualitative drinks, they have Chimay Grand Reserve (blue) which is hard to find. Cosy atmosphere and nice design too!,My wife and I dropped into this gem with some friends on a Friday night for dinner. The atmosphere is romantic but not stuffy, intimate yet really welcoming and warm.  I had the beet and goat cheese salad and absolutely loved it, the warm goat cheese cut the tart of the beets and balsamic perfectly. The scorched sushi is a ""don't miss"". The salmon belly is just kissed with fire which offers a delicious crunch without loosing the sushi-ness.  Finally on a whim I ordered the poached pear for dessert. That's not a typical type of choice for me but it was fantastic! It tasted like autumn in your mouth!  We will absolutely be back and if you haven't given that's my jam a try... what are you waiting for? Go you won't be sorry!,Had just arrived in San Francisco looking for a breakfast spot. So glad we came here. Ate in their cute little outdoor seating area. Had a breakfast sandwich on a croissant which was to die for. Very well balanced and fresh. Love love love,Love this place!  Food is always so good.  Great service as well.  Love their Riesling.  So happy this gem reopened in our neighborhood.,What a hidden gem.  The quality and sophistication of food coming out of this little spot on Divis is outstanding.  Each dish was perfectly balanced - a salmon belly ""nigiri"" that melted like butter in our mouths; a lightly seared tuna with a perfectly spicy and tart cucumber salad; chilled tofu with an herbed salsa that was so smooth and delicate; and a plantain fried rice with perfectly cooked onions, and a surprisingly perfect avocado mash.  The whole menu changes frequently based on the availability and freshness of ingredients, and we can't wait to go back again and again to enjoy the new delights.The service, too, was impeccable.  Everybody was well versed on the menu, had clearly personally experienced each dish and could describe each perfectly, and was wonderfully attentive, friendly, and personable.Truly one of the best new restaurants in the city.   Eat here and support this local, owner-run eatery - you will not be sorry.,Fabulous place 5 star chefLovely staff and decorDelicious bites They cater to all dietsWill be returning for sure,What a hidden neighborhood gem! Absolutely amazing and sophisticated food.So beautiful, you must try it.,Really enjoyed the pork with saffron mustard sauce, beet salad with goat cheese, and plantain fried rice. Great wine list. Owners are super nice. Just reopened after a pandemic shutdown (they opened originally in Feb 2020).,That's My Jam is that truly neighborhood place for when you want 1) a delicious breakfast 2) casual third space to meet friends and gossip 3) the place feels special, cozy, inviting  4) staff who are friendly and engaged and genuinely enjoy being a part of the street life of their neighborhood.My friends J and T wanted to meet last week ( two days before the Mandatory Sheltering was announced ) to discuss some failed travel plans ( early March 2020...guess why? ) so we needed a place we could just unwind ( these are crazy times) feel comfortable lingering and chatting. Lord knows- lots to discuss. Some place cheery. And some place with good food. Just My Jam was our Jam!!!I knew it was the right choice when the employee behind the counter smiled and bantered with us. We ordered and sat and appreciated all the hand sanitizers at the table the cafe provided, just showing they are attentive... We started chatting away and then the food arrived...J got the omelette. I got the avocado toast. T got the almond butter and jam.J- ""damn, that's a great omelette "" T- ""the food is sooooo pretty""Me... ""great avocado toast""Soon...""let's get another toast- peanut butter and jam""We stayed a while. We enjoyed the food, and we enjoyed the space enough to linger there.... Definitely a place to keep coming back!,This place is clearly somebody's dream. It's cute. So I'm giving it an extra star because I acknowledge that everyone has dreams. But my GAWD, this shit is corny. I call it Jam Cafe because there is no way I will ever say the actual name out loud in public. But beyond the name, I'm not sure what it's supposed to be....?In terms of food, there are 2 sandwiches on the menu. Today, it was an egg sandwich and avocado toast. There are also pastries.Then, there's one coffee. Okay, cool. Now, there's also several beers and wines on the chalkboard. Nice. But it's only open early in the day. So is it a cafe or a bar? If it was a cafe, I feel like it should have more food and coffee options. If it's a bar, it should be open later in the day to catch happy hour. If it's purely for brunch, then, well, the proprietor has only read about brunch on Wikipedia. I'm just confused. I think it's a venue made purely to host Tindr dates? It simply feels like gentrification gained sentience and decided to sell colorful boiled eggs. For $7.50. And in terms of flavor, our overpriced breakfast sandwiches were... fine... I think I tasted like one chile flake. It totally captured the zeitgeist of 2015. Which means it will do quite well. Whatever. I've given up on thinking that SF will ever be cool or edgy or interesting again, so I can't blame this place for existing. But I will just keep walking past it. It's actually, probably, better that Jam Cafe opened. It keeps keeps boring people away from the few cool, edgy and interesting places that still exist in the City.,I've worked in the area for 10 years and have tired of the food around here long ago.  I was so excited to see the place finally open on Saturday I had to go in!Ate the most delicious raspberry pastry and berries & cream.  The pastry rivaled those I've eaten in Paris (no joke).  I was so impressed that I went back in today for lunch!  Mark (owner/chef) served an amazing seared Ahi tuna sandwich, seared scallop with blueberry basil drizzle, and a small cup of roasted red pepper soup.  Everything was flavorful, well thought out, and beautifully served.  That's My Jam, is definitely my jam lol :D,I chose this cafe for a lunch meeting because they are newly open and already have great Yelp comments (plus, any restaurant that opened just a week or two before the COVID-19 pandemic deserves extra consideration!). The flavor-packed salmon salad was even more beautiful in-person and the personalized service was warm and inviting.,Love this new addition to Diviz! Clearly a labor of love - they're serving a proper cappuccino, tasty breakfast sandwich with greens and aside of berries & cream, all in a nicely designed space. Get in there!,Amazing people !!!! Truly recommend you to visit and have some food and drinks. Mark and Nadia are passionate it's refreshing. They also serve the wonderful Les Gourmands bakeries,Holy moley what a gem of a cafe. ACTUALLY good food for a reasonable price. Plus the decor is super cute. Loved the scallops and the green salad with pistachios. Yummy. Also got a delicious coffee. I will be stopping in again, many times over. You should too!,We stopped by after the reopening recently and were blown away by the food and wine. This is what you'd expect at any high end restaurant. The only reason for the 4 stars is there are a few things about the atmosphere that don't fit the quality of the food, wine, and service. Specifically there's a refrigerated display that makes it feel like a deli and you have to pay at the counter with their square app. Lastly, the tables feel awkward. Minor things that can easily be remedied and worth ignoring for the delicious salmon, ahi, and desserts. Definitely recommend.,My friend Leila and I went to That's My Jam 3 days in a row during my stay in SF. Beautiful presented food, fair price, friendly owners and staff, and such delicious food. I am back in DC and still crave their breakfast sandwich and the pistachio pastry. Wow. I'd be there likely once a week if I lived nearby. Please make sure to support this terrific small business!,They serve high quality TASTY food for really good prices! Their brioche bread is a must! It's so soft it melts in your mouth! Staff are very nice and friendly. Is it possible to give 10 stars to this ADORABLE place!!,This place is a beautiful addition to the neighborhood. Nadia is a wonderful hostess and the cafe is charming.  What keeps our family coming back is the incredible food!  The breakfast sandwich is to die for, and the pastries are amazing (especially the financiers). I recommend coming to that's my jam anytime you are in the neighborhood.,Great experience when we popped in for brunch with our 2 year old. Pastries, eggs Benedict, and baguette breakfast sandwich were all gorgeous and created with impeccable care, handmade pastries stand apart. A sonewhat Parisian feel between the well-placed flowers and brass counters. Contender for the best breakfast on Divis, but it's,// fill up fast once it's discovered!,Great place, great food, most of all, wonderful people. Their lobster breakfast sandwich is outstanding!!,This place is so beautiful inside! My sister, mom, and I stopped in for breakfast and were greeted very graciously. We ordered breakfast sandwiches, which were delicious. They were served with a side of homemade whipped cream, berries, and honey, which was a delightful surprise. Coffee and fresh juice was also tasty. The staff was attentive and accommodating of our various needs. Check it out if you're in the neighborhood! We will be back.,Just checked it out for the first time and love everything about it. Clean lines, airy atmosphere, AMAZING food &  coffee, and no one rushed me to leave. Looking forward to coming again. Mark the owner is super friendly and I can see why this place will do well,This is one of the best places that I have been to on Diviz. Mark and Nadia , you guys are amazing ! Definitely coming back for the authentic Indian chai,TMJ just opened on Feb 1st and we love trying new coffee houses so had to give this a go.  Coffee was bold and tasty.  The breakfast sandwich is a must.  Many personal touches in the quaint decor.  Well done!,Was walking along Divisadero with my husband and dog and popped in when we saw their sign out front... today was the first day of their soft opening and we were their fifth customers! Absolutely beautiful space and concept, with a big focus on locally sourced goods. Very welcoming + kind staff. We enjoyed the coffees we ordered and are looking forward to trying more of their menu. Really excited for That's My Jam to become a neighborhood staple!,Decided to step in for breakfast and I can't believe how charming this place is! The food was incredible and the wall of flowers makes this the perfect stop to grab a coffee and have a moment of peace before the craziness of the day begins. My husband and I will definitely be returning!,First time in ... they just opened and it was great.  The staff were helpful and friendly - I had an egg and avocado breakfast sandwich- it was yummy and beautifully plated with berries.  Welcome to the neighborhood!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Automat,"I came here on a Friday night around 8:30 PM with my brother for dinner. I would recommend making a reservation because there is a chance they won't be able to seat you. We didn't make a reservation and were able to be seated at the long bat style table looking towards the street. As far as parking, it's possible but may take a few minutes to find street parking. There are a lot of windows in the restaurant which is nice but does increase the volume of the restaurant a lot. I would recommend to the restaurant to put in some boise dampeners. This would make the dining experience more enjoyable.On to the food. We tried three appetizers including the seasonal peppers (shishito), sunchokes with cream, and the scallops with citrus. I would say skip the scallops. They were nothing special even though I really do like scallops. We also shared the steal. This was an interesting dish which has Vietnamese influence. It is served with herbs like thai basil and cilantro as well as seared onions, and a sauce which makes the dish reminiscent of pho. They even cut the steak into two for us.They were out of the crab tostada and the lamb.We also tried a couple of their wines. They do nice heavy pours and even topped us off when our dinner was taking a little bit of time. I definitely recommend automat. It would be great for date night or a small group of friends. It's fun to share around tapas style. Next time I'll save room for desert.,Second time here, first time for lunch. Failed to deliver on previous  dinner experience and featured many broken SF restaurant policies. Order at the counter for lunch. 20% mandatory 'service' charge - oh well, this is SF where it's your privledge to be 'allowed' to dine there. $12 for a 10oz beer - ouch. Chicken sandwich is fine, but don't get the hype. No more unique than any place around the block. The shrimp toast was bomb though!As for that 'service' we paid for? LOL. Not much more than a gruff you're in my way from busers (didn't see any servers during lunch) - wonder where that 20% really goes? They also brought the wrong item (twice) and when told this just walked away. Never bothered to bring the right item we paid for (+20%). Eventually had to get up and go back to the counter to ask for the right item - to-go, as the rest of the party had already finished their food. Magically - it was ready and packed in less than 30 seconds. Some true restaurant wizardry (smoke and mirrors) happening here. I wish them well, but sadly don't think this nameless-investor-return-focused business model will make it to 2024 :(,Honestly super surprised at some of the not so great reviews here. This place ended up being a super delightful surprise for us and will definitely be back. Came here with some friends last night - there were 4 of us and even though I was a little skeptical, we ordered the $65 tasting menu (you can get a main, app and drink for like $60 ish dollars which is why I was skeptical). Boy was I wrong! The amount of food they give you with the tasting menu was insane. Like actually too much. I was pretty full even before we started the mains. And the service was absolutely superb! For the first course, we got a wedge salad. It was absolutely delicious with a creamy cilantro dressing (could of used a tad bit more) and puffed rice as croutons. Best wedge I've ever had. Next we got the foccacia bread - absolutely AMAZING. This is a bakeshop at its core and it really comes through in all the different breads and treats they serve you. Before the main course we also got shishito peppers with cashew queso, seafood crudo, and the most AMAZING pan a cotta with caviar on top (honestly this was more like a dessert and was so so good). We also mistakenly decided to get the sourdough pancake in addition to the tasting menu which, while amazing, was just way too much food. The trout dip it comes with was sooo good. For the mains we got the grilled squab. I didn't love it but was my first time having squab and the flavors were way different from what we had previously eaten. We also got the squid pasta which was very good as well. For dessert, we got the most deliciously gooey, warm sourdough chocolate chip cookie. SO much food guys. Pace yourself. While I was disappointed I couldn't get the fried chicken sandwich or burger for dinner, the food we got did NOT disappoint. I'll certainly be back for lunch to try their sandwiches!o,Have been seeing Automat all over social media & food lists so came for brunch at 11 on a Sunday! The restaurant was packed, but the line wasn't too bad and we managed to find a table for 4. They were already sold out of their famous cinnamon bun, and shortly sold out of their breakfast sandwich afterwards. We tried:- breakfast sandwich (4/5):This seemed to be most popular online and was honestly a lil let down. The sausage was a tad dry and wish the egg was fluffier. I enjoyed the buttery crisp bread and generous amounts of the cheesy herby (kinda pesto-y) sauce. Overall, was good but not the best breakfast sandwich i've had - felt like I was eating straight cheese sauce- fried chicken sandwich (1000/5):(must try!!) best fried chicken sandwich i've had in sf yet!! it came with a massive piece of fried chicken, which was so tender and the perfect amount of spice and sweetness for me. i'm obsessed with the extra layer of maple crunch added, which complimented so well with the pickled veggies- cheezy buddy (3.5/5): i'm not a huge burger person, but was a typical smashburger oozing with strong cheddar cheese and oil. -1 because of how greasy it was- fries (2.5/5):fries were meh - overpriced ($7) and could have been crispier - would skip out on next time. came with automac sauce, which tasted like 1000 island sauce with relish Overall, food was good and would come back for the elevated diner vibes and to try out the dinner menu or bakery goods!,It seemed promising, but it failed to deliver. The restaurant itself is bright and cozy. We liked the vibe. The food was simply not good. We had the roast pork sandwich. The pork was so tough and fatty that you couldn't get a clean bite. The bitter broccoli rabe completely overpowered the sandwich. The focaccia was great though. I'd order just the bread if I could. And yes we lived in Philly. We know a good roast pork sandwich. We also had the greek yogurt which had some granola so tough you could break your teeth. The service was good for a fast casual restaurant. But here they charge you a 20% service charge automatically as if they were a full service sit down restaurant. They're not. You have to wait in line to order and wait to find your own seat. I understand the need to compensate employees fairly, but just raise your menu prices.,Review of breakfast menu only*Surprisingly, Automat was a full house on NYE. You order coffee, pastries and entrées at the at the counter and bring your number over to self seat. It was nice to see people working and dining, so it felt like a cafe. It would be nice if there were more spaces to do so if the location ever expanded. We ordered the fried chicken sandwich, an order of fries, raspberry miso blondie bar, pizza bun, kids grilled cheese, iced latte and a cappuccino.The coffee didn't stand out, but their bakery options were intriguing and it seemed like the ovens were pumping out trays of bread galore. The raspberry miso blondie tasted like an upscale granola bar. The pizza bun was lackluster; while it looked appealing, didn't have much flavor or depth under the toppings.The fried chicken sandwich was pretty large and is definitely shareable. Add some hot sauce on the side to include some moisture (sorry) to the very crispy and seasoned sandwich, which is covered in what looks like a mixture of pepper and chili flakes. The sando does not come with fries, so order that separately. The fries have a house made thousand island sauce. Overall, I'd return for their dinner menu, which I believe is rotating around the seasons. The scallop crudo stands out on their current menu and their NYE prix fixe menu sounded enjoyable.,Cafe/daytime review only - still have yet to check them out for dinner!Automat is a hip, fairly large spot with plenty of seating, pastries and breads, and the usual hot and iced caffeinated drinks. I usually get tea there; I have had their coffee and I am not qualified to say if it was good or not given my favorite coffee is probably an iced super sweet one from Dunkin, and Automat (rightfully) does not offer such a concoction. The tea choice is good, you will have to find out about the coffee on your own.But the bread!! Holy moly. I have never felt so delightfully sinful eating a piece of sourdough. And their focaccia is SO good; crusty and chewy and flavorful. Every time I have stopped by they have had a different pastry to offer, as well as some constants (cookie, sourdough, focaccia, cinnamon rolls, etc.) I have tried their breakfast sandwiches with the sausage and egg, tbh was maybe a little too bougie for me personally but it was still undeniably quality.Prices are a little higher than your neighborhood Starbucks, but the spot is clean and cool, and the food is great!,I came here for dinner on a Friday around 8;30, and it is a very cute space in a very convenient location on Baker. However, it definitely will be hard to find parking if you're coming on a weekday, so be wary of that. I really love the ambiance of the restaurant, and all of the staff were so nice and accommodating.For food, we started with the garlic herb pretzel focaccia, the sourdough pancake, the french fries and the scallop crudo. The focaccia was very good, super garlicky topping and balanced out the saltiness of the pretzel - 9/10. The fries were great, and the sourdough pancake was a great texture, but it (and a few other things) lacked a little bit of salt - 8/10. The scallop crudo was delicious and there was wonderful presentation and balance of flavours with the kumquat and herbs - 10/10. For mains we got the squid ink pasta, the roasted squab, and the NY strip steak. The pasta was a little bland, but the panko brought a really nice texture - 6/10. The squab was delicious and beautifully presented  - 9/10, and the NY strip steak was cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious - 10/10. Overall, dining at the Automat was a good experience, but I think that some of the food fell a little short of my expectations. I would definitely come back for lunch/breakfast, but maybe I would return for dinner to try the Automatic menu.,Automat is popping up all over SF restaurant lists so we we came in on a Sunday morning. They do not take reservations in the daytime, only for evening/dinner. The line wasn't too bad but finding seating was pretty difficult. All tables are first come first serve and the booths are designated for parties of 3 or more only. You order at the counter, take a number, and then will have food brought out to you. In that sense Automat is very casual. The rotating menu and the quality of the food however speaks otherwise--much fancier!My vegetarian bf had a Zadie's sandwich. The portion was super small for $9 (it came on a milk bun) but it was delicious. There's nothing I love more than a delicious breakfast sandwich. Which leads me to what I found the most disappointing: the Automat breakfast sandwich, which is what I selected. The portion was larger (which I expected for $13) but it was one of those sandwiches that was really difficult to enjoy after the first bite. The wondermat bread was nice and crispy but overly buttered (read: oily) and the cheese sauce was extremely rich and salty. It definitely could have benefited from a tomato slice or something to cut the fat. The egg omelette was also a little weird--it was very soft and creamy in texture, almost like a pudding? It tasted fine but I think I would have preferred a regular scrambled or fried egg :( the Automat breakfast sandwich wasn't terrible overall but I wouldn't get it again, a solid 2.5 stars. The redeeming entree that our group got to share was the candy cap brick toast which was AMAZING. It's literally what it sounds like: a thick cut of toast that's crisped up nicely on the outside yet soft and fluffy on the inside, with a brûléed sugar shell on top, and various toppings like shaved persimmon, candied nuts, and marscapone (or ricotta? I can't recall). This was such a unique and tasty dish, neither too sweet nor greasy. It's drier than a french toast for comparison but I actually liked the textures of this preparation way better. A shining 5 stars for that and it alone gives me hope for what other dishes they have curated to this caliber. Automat definitely has great food options and I'm curious to try what they have to offer in the spring. Just be warned that you should prepare to fight the crowds to get a table, and that not necessarily every menu item is a big hit.,Great coffee shop vibes for anyone who's looking for a fun vibey neighborhood cafe to catch up with a friend, do some work, or light reading. Ambience: pretty loud and has music playing. Lots of conversations so not for those who are trying to do hardcore work or heavy focusWifi: There is cable wifi but you have to connect through your wifi provider (?) I just signed in with xfinity and it worked pretty quick for me. Food: Their baked goods - focaccia bread, cinnamon roll - was amazing! I tried their fried chicken sandwich and it was super filling (larger than your hand). Definitely room for leftovers, for a $17 sandwich I'd expect no less. The sandwich is also pretty spicy and has a unique blend of mala spice, sesame seeds, and chili powder so I'd ask them to go light on the spices if you are sensitive. All items already have an automatic 20% tip added to it. Seating: Plenty of tables and space to go around on a Friday afternoon. There were some empty seats around me at 2pm. When I want a change of environment I'll be back here again!,*3.5 stars* Review reflects my dinner experience. TL;DR While there are a number of pros when it comes to the food, the service & a few other details have me hesitant to return. Snagged some walk-in seats at the counter on a Tuesday. We were told they suggest a family-style approach to the menu. I personally don't recommend this for the bigger plates because the way the plates came didn't suggest they should be shared and none were ready to scoop/eat. We had to cut them into shared portions and they don't provide additional cutlery to do it. I think it'd be easier just to share the apps and get your own entrees. Pros:- salt n pepa shrimp is great. it's packed with flavor and crispy. it comes 2/order, but we were able to ask for a third to be added. - seafood is fresh & the roasted honeynut squash dish was delicious. the flavor in the mushrooms was explosive. yum! - tempura pole beans were also delicious! Cons:- Crispy sourdough pancake is tasty on the exterior, but the interior is so bland. - Considering they push for ""family style,"" I expected these bigger plates to be slightly more generous in size. It was also a hassle to need to cut everything into 3 servings when we're sitting at a counter and need to pass plates back and forth. Family style shouldn't require so much effort imo and should at least come with serving utensils. - Our server was hard to track down from the get-go. We sat for 20+ min before ordering. They never checked in during the meal. New dishes came, but finished plates were not cleared and we sat at the counter where space was already limited. To pay the bill, we had to track the hostess down instead. Just felt forgotten overall. Misc.:- Be sure to read the bottom of the menu for the already-included 20% service charge! You pay via QR code and according to my friend, the site does NOT disclose this on the tipping screen. I originally wanted to visit for their brunch, so if I return, I will update my review. I probably won't be back for dinner, though.,Food Review: - California Fried Hot Chicken Sandwich (5/5): Probably one of the chicken sandwiches I've had in the city. The chicken is super crispy (love the maple crunch they add on top! Added a nice sweetness) and juicy. It's also quite a large piece of chicken (shareable for sure). - Cheezy Buddy (3.5/5): double cheeseburger done smashburger style. Good beef flavor, but there was a lot of grease that came out of the burger and I thought the cheese wasn't as garlicky as advertised. - Automat Breakfast Sandwich (4.5/5): Super tasty breakfast sandwich. I really enjoyed the eggs (thicc square) and herbed pimento cheese sauce there was a lot of it. The bread was toasted to a golden brown. I didn't like the breakfast sausage too much and would have preferred an alternative meat option- Fries (3/5): They were mid - nothing special. They came with a thousand island ish sauceWe came in between breakfast and lunch, but they place were already quite packed. The service was good and we were still able to find a seat after placing our order. The cinnamon rolls and other breakfast items were sold out by 11 :/ so definitely will have to come back to try those.,Never have I ever teared up at a restaurant because the service and experience was so great....until tonight. Thanks, Jake. Came here for a 5:45 reservation on this Friday night. When I arrived, I was greeted by the host who sat me immediately. The restaurant is clean and has a sleek casual look. Honestly, you might not realize the caliber of the cuisine from the outside, but I like that. It's relaxed and everyone was warm and welcoming. My friend and I opted for the pre-fix menu for 65$/pp. Everything on the menu looked good - so why not? Jake, our server, was extremely attentive and full of knowledge and recs. They let us taste wines before committing and always picked the right ones. Our favs:-caviar (exclusive to the tasting menu)-THE COOKIE-tuna-pretzel bread-squash(my friend like the chicory salad... but too bitter for me)Jake let us take our time and was genuinely curious about our ranking of the menu. Jake also let us give our own wild recommendations for what should go on the menu- can we get some short rib on there?!?All and all, a lovely experience. Jake expressed gratitude for our time and that is when I actually teared up and they didn't even judge for that. Come here for the experience and the food.,Came here for a weekend lunch with friend and loved it! The fried chicken sandwich is the best I've had in the city, and one of the best I've ever had. We also had the early girl tomato sandwich, which was fantastic. The anchovy mayo was to die for. For any meat-obsessed skeptics of vegetarian food, that sandwich would have a good chance of converting them. I also ordered a bunch of their bakery items including banana bread, cheddar biscuit, garlicky pretzel focaccia, and a pizza bun. All of them were fantastic. The banana bread might be the best I've ever had, and I could easily pound a whole bucket of cheddar biscuits.The only reason I give it 4 stars is because two of the dishes I tried--the carrot cake granola and the taco--were subpar. I was really excited about the carrot cake granola because I love both carrot cake and granola, but it felt like something I could've made at home and the flavors didn't blend that nicely together. The tacos felt just a step up from Jack in the Box tacos.But for the sandwiches and the bakery items, I'd come back again and again and again. Would love to try their dinner sometime as well!,Love Automat! Recently went here for dinner and it was fantastic. I love this spot for lunch but for dinner, it was so so good. I like they are fast casual for lunch and almost fine dining for dinner.I came on a Wednesday a little before 7 I was seated right away, which was great. The service was amazing. I loved our waiter. They allowed us to swap one of the dishes for another. That was super kind of them!I got the pre fixed menu for $65. I feel like that's a good deal for the amount of food you get. The pre fixed option came with 9 dishes, I think (not all pictured). Each dish was super tasty. I like how seasonal the dishes are. It makes the experience super unique and memorable. My favorites were the cornflake caviar, lemon lime chicken, and semifredo.,Came to Automat with the girls for our book club dinner. We decided to order family style and try a little bit of everything! We ordered:-Garlicky Pretzel Focaccia-Shishito Peppers-Tombo Tuna-Salt N' Pepa Shrimp-Crispy Sourdough Pancake-Little Gem Wedge-Frankie's Fries-Sourdough Chocolate Chip Cookie-Strawberry Semifreddo-Birthday Cake TwinkieThe highlights of our meal were the pretzel focaccia (a must order!) shishito peppers, tombo tuna, and fries. The tuna was so fresh and definitely a favorite among the girls! We unfortunately didn't try as many of the proteins as we wanted. The only dish that we were very unimpressed with was the salt n' pepa shrimp. It was soooo salty and briney it almost ruined the meal for us. We did mention this to the waitress because it was so overpowering if we knew that prior we probably wouldn't have ordered it. For dessert I would recommend the chocolate chip cookie or the strawberry semifreddo. The eucalyptus in the strawberry semifreddo was so unique and quite refreshing. The birthday cake twinkie was just a little too dry for our liking.Overall I'd recommend coming in to Automat and giving them a try!,Five stars for the fried chicken sandwich alone! Very unique flavors, chicken is crispy and just the right amount of spice for me. There's also some sweetness from some sort of furikake mix on it and the Cole slaw adds great balance. Definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu,I shared half a ""Cheezy Buddy"" with ""Automac,"" which is Automat's smashburger with pickled onions, garlic cheddar plus lettuce, tomato,1000-island-y sauce, on a milk bun. The 7 oz burger was properly cooked and crispy on the edges, but the meat-bun ratio didn't seem right. I wasn't a fan of the squish-to-touch milk bun and the shredded pickled onions, which seemed to give the burger an oily, sour taste. There wasn't enough lettuce in the Automac too. The dressing was fine, but unrecognizable. I might try the burger again without the pickled onions, but that's the way they suggest it, so I'm a bit hesitant. I also got a cinnamon roll, which was really really good! It was quite flavorful but not too rich, which was a very good thing. Finally, this restaurant is a huge upgrade from the Green Chile Cafe! They made it look so much nicer and there seems to be other options on the menu.,Came here for lunch on a weekday and it was pretty busy - lots of people working because they have wifi here. I got the fried chicken sandwich and the pretzel garlic focaccia and my friends got the chicken sandwich and the breakfast sandwich. I love the focaccia - it is big so definitely an item to share or bring home. I wouldn't get the chicken sandwich again - it was very messy and I thought the flavor was fine but not worth the hype. My friends enjoyed their breakfast sandwich but thought the same about the chicken sandwich.Would come back and try some of the other items!,The salad had a fantastic crème fraîche herb dressing on it. The Zadie the sandwich was small and simple but delicious and so soft with a perfect soft egg yolk inside. The biscuit was excellent and the home brew kombucha was a great accompaniment. When we got there at around 3 o'clock there was a very small selection left but that's OK because everything is made fresh. I like this place.,This place is SO good and I love how they are open for Sunday brunch! Do yourself a favor and order the breakfast sandwich (the herbed pimento cheese is bomb.com), carrot cake granola (who woulda thought carrot puree and greek yogurt go so well together), and the baker's focaccia (it's stone fruit season so peach is currently in season). Actually, in general, the bread here is legit and I can't wait to come back and try the other bakery items - as well as the famed California fried chicken sandwich.  Also very friendly priced given that the chef is a Lazy Bear alum and we're dining in SF. But not sure if I'd come back for dinner given the Yelp reviews. But I docked a star for the automatic 20% gratuity. We have to order at the register first and much of the rest of the restaurant is self service.,Man automatic serves one MASSIVE chicken sandwich. If you're in SF and appreciate a fine, fried chicken sandwich you have to check out automat. The taste is immaculate and all of the additional toppings that are put on really compliment the chicken.The atmosphere is also great with a handful of people able to conduct some work here when I stopped by for lunch. The service is also super friendly and will assist you with anything you might need after your seated. Great all around establishment!,TL;DR If you see an open reservation here, it's Automat(ic)It's no small feat to make the interior aesthetic a secondary consideration, but the food has done the improbable. I'm not sure what brown butter brujeria was performed on the caviar and grits, but alas, I was spellbound from the first course. Followed in quick succession by the garlic focaccia and chicory salad, I felt the one-way train to flavortown had no plans of stopping. A few more courses and the main was served. We substituted the roast chicken for the steak, and it's a fantastic alternative. Finished with the (maybe not so) sourdough cookie and ""charcuterie"", I struggle to remember a negative vibe this whole meal. Would recommend Automat to any and all looking for a culinary adventure ala carte (or prix fixe).,I have to admit I was secretly hoping this was going to be the rebirth of Horn & Hardart's NYC-based self-service chain from years ago when you were able to get hot food through mammoth vending machines. The Automat was featured in a lot of Hollywood movies in the middle of the last century. Realistically though, I figured the name was probably a riff on fast food and had nothing to do with the vending machines (...remember the failed Eatsa?) Well, it turned out I was right.Still, it was a good place to meet my friend Maggie for lunch since it has a chill vibe where you order at the counter. It was certainly a haven for hipster laptoppers as they were sitting at most of the booths and tables. The daytime menu was an eclectic mix of salads, sammies, and pastries courtesy of owner Matt Kirk, a former sous chef at Lazy Bear. Maggie ordered the $12 Little Gem Wedge Salad which featured sprouted grains, puffed wild rice, and herbed buttermilk dressing (photo: bit.ly/3xXJ0As). It was a nice, healthy twist on the usual wedge salad.I decided to try the $14 Veggie Dip Sandwich where they combined deli-sliced roasted celery root with spicy giardiniera spread into a toasted sesame-seed-encrusted baguette and provided a cup of veggie au jus (photo: bit.ly/3xUhu6W). It was a bit too bready for my taste, but it was definitely a unique take on a diner classic. We also shared a $6 bowl of Frankie's Fries which proved to be mildly addictive with their automac sauce. Think Cheez Whiz (photo: bit.ly/3y2gKN4). The $4 Arnold Palmer was a nice libation (photo: bit.ly/3OP6UVN). Now what do I do with all my change?FOOD - 4 stars...good, creative casual fareAMBIANCE - 4 stars...pretty casual but stay six feet away from the laptoppers SERVICE - 4 stars...pretty chill staffTOTAL - 4 stars...I'd still like to see a real AutomatRELATED - Exploring NoPa? Here's a collection of places I've visited and reviewed: bit.ly/2uMQ82p,I use to live just down the street from this place when it was Green Chili House and when I move away they close down and a new spot opens, Automat, from Lazy Bear alumns. Go figure. Anyways, swung in with some friends and this place is soooo popular. They have counter seats facing the windows, a lot of 4-top seating in the center, and order at the counter.Go early or look for the line out the door and the empty baked goods display case.We snagged two breakfast sandos, a cheesy burger, the granola, fries, and a handful of pastries and some coffees. Listen, this place is Michelin quality for normal people prices. It's just a matter of time before they make the Bib Gourmand list or some popular 'top 100' best list that makes it completely impossible to snag anything without a one hour wait. Tldr: go now and thank me later. Get one of everything.,Another bookmarked foodie destination.  I didn't know when I'd have a chance to come; however that day was today.  Hubby & I were on our ebikes with an in between doctor appointment.  While waiting to see the doctor, I perused my San Francisco private Yelp collection.  Where to eat, what to eat, how far, etc.  After my appointment I gave hubby three choices - hoagie sandwich, fish & chips, or yet another artisan fried chicken sandwich.  Guess what he picked?   We biked over to Automat.  It's housed in the former Green Chile Pie location on the corner.  Parked our bikes.  I went in to place an order to go.  No outdoor dining. Two fried chicken sandwiches with one order of Frankie's fries.  I was advised automatic 20% service charge.  I placed my order, paid, and asked how long.  He said 8 minutes.  It took under 10 minutes.  We biked over to the Panhandle three blocks away.  Sat by the William McKinley statue to eat.  The fried chicken thigh sandwich was huge.  Easily can feed two. It had a great crunch.  I thought it sweet and spicy.   Make sure you've got plenty of napkins cuz it's a saucy sando.  Served on a nice milk bun.  The Frankie's fries were over the top.  So crispy.  And temperature hot.  Maybe double fried.  Came with a nice dipping sauce.  The chocolate chip cookie caught hubby's eye.  We passed as we've got plenty of sweets at home. There were many dining patrons around noontime.  Definitely a place to return to.  And maybe hubby can get a cookie next time.,Very fun atmosphere just off Divis. The burger and pork belly was excellent, the other items were so-so.Most importantly- check your soup dumplings before eating. The chicken was completely raw in ours and thank god we checked. I was amazed they didn't take them off our bill or treat us to a dessert or something. Flavor wise, the dumplings were tasty I just found the broth a bit too sweet. I recommend halving the size of the croutons in the apparagus salad, or letting them sit in the dressing before plating, they were very large and quite hard, hard to eat. I think cutting the asparagus differently would also benefit the dish, it was hard to fork them given how small the pieces were.  I also feel the cured yolk should be plated at the top of the salad.. it was buried despite it being the star Service was friendly and helpful given how busy they were, though I didn't appreciate our waiter trying to persuade us to tip more on top of the 20% gratuity give the dumpling experience.,Came here on a weekday for dinner and was a little disappointed. I've heard great things about this place and it's been in my bookmark. We ordered sweet potato pave, cheez buddy, brown-butter seared cabbage, baked rock cod and pork belly. The cheez buddy was really good and everything else was ok or not good at all. I don't think I would be coming back for dinner but I might come back for brunch since my friends said that their brunch menu is a lot better than dinner.,Our second visit to Automat was just as good as the first, if not better!I stuck with the Smoked Trout Toast (which was delicious), but my boyfriend ordered the Fried Chicken Sandwich. During our meal, I must have heard him praise his dish at least three times for its preparation, taste, and overall quality. The sourdough chocolate chip cookie was a nice way to finish our meal (note: the pastries seem to sell out quickly). We're likely to become brunch regulars of this spot!,Yuppy cafe with sandwiches, bakery, and coffee Had the zadie's sandwich for breakfast which was an egg and cheese sandwich..also had an iced latte ..tasty and cute..young,DINNER REVIEW - Delicious Dishes, the plates are small so order several plates if you're really hungry.  Food and Service and Ambiance was great.  Not too fancy and not too casual. Great place to have dinner and good wine.,The fried chicken sandwich here did not disappoint - was juicy and flavorful. We also tried the salad and the grilled cheese and those were quite good. Ambience and everything checked out too.Lesser about the food quality: they have a mandatory 20% tip which is, in my opinion, is a little steep given you have to go up to the register to pay yourself and the servers were not very friendly to us.,Best fcuking breakfast sandwich ever!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The first time I had it, I already told myself I wanted to have it again before I leave home to socal. And tbh, it's better than eggslut. Highly recommend. If you took the sandwich tò go, try it again in house, your moth and tummy will thank ya,Lovely little spot in the heart of NoPa. My boyfriend and I decided to stop by on a Thursday evening and we were seated within 30 minutes without reservations. Everything was shareable for 2-3 people, so highly recommend doing family style. We got the fococcia (a little salty but super fluffy and garlicy), the salad was super good and refreshing (there's dairy in the dressing) loved the sprouted lentils, fried chicken was fried to perfection, and the fries were a hit as well. There's a 20% service fee automatically added so it's good to keep that in the back of your mind!,Came here after seeing it on TikTok. Got there for a late lunch and got the fried chicken sandwich...+ chicken sandwich was very crispy and filling + cute aesthetic inside, could see people working there since they have wifi + felt like a local neighborhood spot + parking was easy to find, quiet area+ friendly staff- sandwich could've used some spice / little more flavor - slightly on the pricey side at $20 total with tax etc,Don't order the Sunchokes. :(Seriously. Let me reiterate: Don't. Order. The Sunchokes.I truly hope Yelp doesn't pull my review, because this is actually a health issue. I know that in an ideal world I would have researched every ingredient of everything that I consume at a restaurant, to make sure that I wasn't about to consume something that would make me physically ill. However...Sunchokes contain some shiz that is not readily digestible within the human body. Also if you're thinking you could chow down on Sunchokes for dinner and be totally fine later in the evening...oh honey, you better hope your partner also downed those Sunchokes right along with you because if not you are for sure sleeping on the couch. It was a literal Atmospheric Fart River, after a drought of...well, atmospheric Fart Rivers. Service was fantastic. (Although they MUST know by now about these damn Sunchokes!!) Bill was a LOT. Probably because we went there with our two kids (who thank GOD didn't eat the sunchokes, apparently we are the stupid Sunchoke-eating adults.) I think they liked it. Bread was amazing, for sure. It was a nice time, until...,My friends and I (there were three of us) came here for TGIF dinner and were just really impressed by the great fusion of flavors and whimsy in all of the dishes we tried.  We had the crispy sourdough pancake, sweet potato pave and bulgogi broccolini for appetizers, ricotta gnudi," baked rock cod """"fish stick"""" and grilled pork chop for entrees", and chocolate chip cookie and brick toast for dessert.  Some of the dishes were a nice fusion of East and West - the bulgogi broccolini had kimchi gremolata and the ricotta gnudi had tom kha (Thai) cream. Some were just really playful takes on classic American dishes (crispy sourdough pancake, sweet potato pave," brick toast).  The most impressive thing for me was the grilled pork chop - it was duroc pork ribeye with beet """"char siu""""", fried Brussels and kumquat.  There was just an amazing smokiness and unique flavor to this dish.  It's pork ribeye so there's plenty of fat (which I love).  When my friend ate her portion of the sourdough chocolate chip cookie," she looked at me and said """"that's a damn good cookie.""""  Just a perfect meal all around. Service was excellent and with tax and tip", this was about $50-$55 per person - which is a fantastic value.  Highly, highly recommended!!!,A whole lot of hype & a whole lot of disappointment! I made reservations here on a Saturday evening after finding out that this establishment has Lazy Bear and Tartine alumni. However, I can't justify dropping ~$90/person for a casual dinner experience filled with mediocre food and poor service (waitress brought out the wrong beer on two separate occasions and didn't offer to fix the issue/was rude, ignored reservation comments). For small plates, my partner and I shared the garlicky pretzel focaccia and crispy sourdough pancake. The focaccia was just okay but not memorable at all. The pancake was tasty though, and it was definitely unique. Note that both of these items were tiny and a lot smaller than what they appear in photos. For bigger plates," we shared the baked rock cod and hot fried chicken. The cod was fresh but lacked flavor. The """"hot"""" fried chicken looked spicy because it was drenched in a dry red powdery seasoning but it wasn't spicy at all and just tasted way too salty.For dessert"," we got the sourdough chocolate chip cookie and brick toast. I'm not sure why """"sourdough"""" is even in the cookie's name because it just tasted like a plain chocolate chip cookie...not bad but nothing special. The brick toast tasted decent", but it wasn't great enough for me to come back for more. Additionally, while a lot of restaurants add a candle to your dessert if you're celebrating a birthday, note that Automat doesn't do anything special for birthdays if that's something you're looking for. Overall, everything I tried here was either just okay or not good at all. The poor service also didn't justify the predetermined 20% service charge. If you want a better dinner experience at a similar price point that also offers shareable small plates, try State Bird Provisions (1 Michelin star) instead. Or just go to Tartine for your carb fix.,Came with a large group + kids so we were lucky enough to allmmmosssstttt order one of everything to try! I believe they just started their dinner service two months ago, so still relatively new. Better to make a reservation for sure but I saw some folks that were able to get in and get some counter seats as a a walk-in. Space is really cute and simple, love the color palette (that green!) and high ceilings. Service is SOOOOO good here, extremely family friendly. Everyone is so nice, helpful, and accommodating. One of them even offered her help since she saw me (probably struggling) holding my baby the entire meal (THANK YOU!).Here is what we got to try:Garlicky Pretzel Focaccia $5SO good. MUST GET. If you're a large group, I'd recommend getting multiple orders. Love the strong garlic flavors and how nicely fluffy/chewy the bread is.Pepperoni Peppers $10I don't recommend this dish. Didn't really get it haha Basically peppers and cheese.Crispy Sourdough Pancake $9Their description says it all...cheesy crunchy warm gooey salty mmm.. this is definitely a must get and eat it hottttt!Little Gem Wedge $12I would pass on this one...nothing special, and the sauce was on the lighter side. I love puffed wild rice but it kinda looked a bit like maggots at first glance :PSpicy Beet Salad $13I loved this so much, the Thai basil flavors are so fresh. There's a whole array of textures that you get in every bite. So flavorful. Get it.Lamb Tartare $15I thought this was good but nothing to rave home about!Sweet Potato Pave $12This was a recommendation from our server. Oh man was he right :) This is so good and unique, not sure I've had something quite like it. I loved the slight sweetness of the sweet potato when combined with that bomb sauce.Ricotta Gnudi $18This was so light and fluffy! But super rich with cheesy flavors at the same time :) Good dish to share," don't think I would've been able to eat more than 1-2 pieces haha.Baked Rock Cod """"Fish Stick"""" $29This was good", but probably not $29 good? Very pretty dish with edible flowers as garnish, but I don't know...maybe it wasn't hot enough or maybe it wasn't breaded thoroughly enough for me. Probably could've used a bit more seasoning too.Grilled Pork Chop $30The flavors are of char Siu, so sweeter and richer. This was probably my least favorite dish. It's a large portion, but every bite just tasted so heavy and fatty I couldn't even finish one slice of it :*( Needed something to cut the fat (more veggies perhaps but not something deep fried, like the Brussels sprouts that it came with)Grilled Duck Breast $33This was cooked sooooo well. I loved how tender this was. This was probably more gamey, but that is to be expected from duck. Wish the shiso flavors were stronger.Sourdough Chocolate Chip Cookie $3This was good, but I don't think I could've picked out that there was any sourdough in this? Just a regular good ole chocolate chip cookie.Brick Toast $7Tastes like a French toast. Yummm.Buttermilk Panna Cotta $8This definitely looked the fanciest out of all the dessert options, but was probably my least favorite. Did not love the celery granita unfortunately :( Also a little bit of salt is good in dessert but I tasted too much of that over the sweetness of the panna cotta.In general, I think the food was good, but I think I may have expected a bit more since there's been so much hype around the restaurant + their new dinner service. I'd love to come back and try their breakfast sandwiches, they look so good!,I came here for lunch on Saturday and it was bustling! You order at the counter and find your own seating. I can see that working most of the time, but there are also people camped here with laptops, which can make it tricky if they get an influx of customers. Nothing on the lunch menu really spoke out to me except for the California Hot Chicken Sandwich ($15). I had that with iced tea, and we also got a Little Gem Wedge Salad ($13). You fill up your own water pitchers and grab your own utensils if you're dining in. They should cross out the Hot in the Hot Chicken Sandwich because it was not spicy at all. I saw a thin dusting of red powder, which I guess is the spice, but none of it translated to spiciness. The chicken had a really great, thin batter, and it was pretty big. The sandwich got pretty greasy towards the end. The Wedge Salad was fresh and covered in a bunch of little crunchy bits. They were super generous with the dressing; there was a pool of it under the lettuce. There's a 20% service fee automatically added, and they remind you of that when the tip screen comes up, which is nice. However, our lunch (two sandwiches, a salad, and an iced tea and kombucha) came up to $70, which is kind of an insane number to spend on lunch. But that's SF, I guess.,Caveat - Not cheap.I always like to nominate one meal a year as my favorite - and this will be difficult to beat. (Even though it is only March!)From a Lazy Bear Alum, this place it tucked away in the Old Chili Pies location - in the Nopa area (but not on Divisidero). They have been open for breakfast for a while, and now more recently added dinner  service as they get their sea legs. (they were only accepting reservations for parties of 6 or more, but have recently relaxed that stipulation, and we made a reservation on a Wednesday for that night.) I didn't realize it was small plates before i went - so once I realized we were ordering 2-3 dishes per person the bill added up quickly.We got:*the braised head of cabbage - YUM *pretzel foccacia - Lots of other reviews said this was a large portion (and photos show an enitre round loaf, - I think they must have changed it  - because it was not a large portion for us, only 4 pieces.*The sourdough pancake*The cod*the Pastrami - SOOOOO GOOD!*Roasted broccolini*a piece of hot fried chicken(then all three dessert options a panna cotta (not worth it), a sourdough chocolate chip cookie and a bread pudding type thing.)That pastrami - was CRAZY - I wish they offered a sandwich of it at lunch.The cabbage was a stellar winner as well, nice and soft, with sauce I could not figure out what was it was.The Fried chicken was scrumptious with an unusual breading - Kinda pricy - but definitely makes me want to go back for the fried chicken sandwich at lunch.Our Waitress Emily was a doll.The space is clean and bright with lots of windows out to the adorable neighborhood.Wine is pricey here too - the cheapest bottles being about $50.  We were 4 people and left full after the food listed, plus 2 bottles of wine. It was about $350. (BUT NOTE BILL is the NEW restaurant model and includes a 20% tip, which they did point out before we paid)Happy to go back! - maybe to try the lunch or breakfast menu.,Because it's a place in our neighborhood," my husband and I decide to try it with a friend of us. During lunch the rule is """"first come first serve""""", so when we arrived around noon we waited few minutes before seated in a table for 3 or more people. The location is not big and they have a lot of tables just for 2 people. Once you seated, anyone serve you but you have to order directly at the desk. I don't know why it's called automat if anything is automatic (it's just my thought). While we were waiting our friends, we ordered a slice of focaccia with ricotta pear walnut and honey. The taste was good but I think it would be better if it was hot and richer of the ingredients on the list. When our friend arrived, we ordered the fried chicken sandwich for us and our friend chose the breakfast sandwich. The fried chicken was good (crispy outside and tender inside), but it was too spicy. Our friend enjoyed his choice. I don't know if I was completely satisfied because I tried other fried chicken that I enjoyed more, but it's a nice place to hangout with a friend and having lunch together.,"Was horrified when I looked down and saw two mice scuttle by our table. I was even more horrified by the staff's response to the situation when I brought it to their attention and the response was: """"I think they're cute"""". No manager on sight that day and when I tried to call the restaurant there is no option to leave a message or to a human. BIG YIKES.*should also note staff didn't make any attempts to remedy the situation",I think this is one of best fried chicken sandwiches I ate this year Open table seating where you order from the counter. They put a 20% service charge for your order FYI incase you wonder why your bill is expensive! I would definitely come back whenever I am craving fried chicken. Get busy around lunch time though, so finding a seat is like hunger games.,Sweet place to hangout and do some work but a bit too expensive for my liking.I was looking for a place to get some work done over lunch and found myself at Automat. Ordered the Automatic Hot Dog and was pleasantly surprised. It's piled very high (see picture) and a bit hard to eat but tasted great. My partner ordered the fried chicken sandwich and also really enjoyed it. Not two items that I would recommend trying to eat while working but great to fuel up before getting into it. The lunch dishes didn't come with any sides but you can complement with pastries available at the counter.With the music, kitchen, and other patrons, it is a bit loud so I'd recommend bringing headphones if you want to block out the noise. There are outlets but they are only one one side of the cafe, against the window. On a busy day, I could see it being challenging to get one of those seats. Wifi worked great!,I'll start off by saying that I REALLY wanted to love this place. The chef has great credentials from Lazy Bear," but overall the experience was underwhelming. I always try to rate restaurants through the lens of """"Is it worth it at its price?"""" And unfortunately for this spot", the answer was no. My family and I got the tasting menu which is available for $65/person--but also keep in mind there's a 20% service charge automatically added. Upon choosing the tasting menu, we alerted the waitress of a food intolerance and requested a modification. We were surprised when the waitress then asked us if it was a severe allergy, and when we said no, she seemed annoyed and said she'd see what the chef could do. For the price of the tasting menu, I thought whether it was an allergy, intolerance, or even a preference," that the guest could be accommodated for. So we immediately felt put off by the interaction.The food itself was meh and the portions were not easily shareable among three people. They kept bringing dishes out in two plates which made splitting very difficult. The most disappointing thing was when they gave us half a steak to split between three people for the """"main entree"""". I truly hate writing these types of reviews because I love restaurants and I want to see them all succeed", but I really felt that people who are considering this place for dinner ought to know. I hope that the team is receptive to this feedback, and who knows, maybe my family and I were just unlucky and came by on an off night!,Clearly I, and many people, have been following Automat to the ends of the world (or maybe just Westside San Francisco) but I am OVERJOYED to see their success in this brick and mortar slot! Take my money!!!The MUST: the breads, burger, fried chicken sandwiches. Good god, these are so classically good it's infuriating. Truly among my favorite fried chicken sandwiches out there, and at $15 I assure you, it's worth it. The date night: a friend and I stopped by recently for dinner, having last had Automat's pop up dinners a few times pre-Pandemic. Friday evening was tight and we had to take the one 8:45pm reservation! Fantastic service, great ambiance, not too loud with an eclectic mix of music. Fancier than a fancy diner. Ordered: beers, squid ink chips and dip, brown butter seared cabbage and leeks, spicy beet larb, squid cavatelli, potato pave, broccolini, buttermilk panna cotta for dessert. Honestly I think I'm missing some of the things we ordered but we left so full, I don't even know if I'll remember.It was DELICIOUS. But if any of you are entering your thirties, maybe don't eat that late. GERD is real.Alright, make your reservation ASAP, Automat is about to take off!,The Good: The burger was tasty, good flavors! The Bad: Skimpy on the veggies, there should have been more pickles and tomatoes in particular.The Ugly: That tiny cup of iced tea cost $5 (seriously) and they wouldn't give me a refill?! WTF? These guys need to learn to love their customers, not just extract money. I won't be going back.,This was quite possibly the best fried chicken sandwich I've ever had! My only wish was that it was spicier.The garlic pretzel focaccia is humongous and is fairly priced at $12. It was a bit salty and I feel it'd go great with some sauce or pesto on the side.We also had a brioche donut that was great as a small dessert. Order at the front, grab a seat, and enjoy the great service/food! I'll be back for the chicken sandwich for sure, and I'll bring some hot sauce hehe.,Best restaurant if you want a simple snacks but delicious.,"4.5 STARSThat moment when you walk in to no line AND see the very last strawberry cheesecake donut in the case...You silently scream: """"YAS!"""" and do the *IMAGINARY* Carlton dance because you don't want to look cray cray", though that's nothing new in SF. But, then...it gets taken away.*Whomp*I guess the donut gods weren't having it today. The staff was so nice and apologetic, and offered a free donut on my next visit. Ok, so within 2 hours of opening, nothing was left in the pastry case except loaves of bread. That's what happens when a Lazy Bear alum opens up his own shop! Automat opened yesterday and today for a sneak preview for breakfast and lunch. They'll fully open on 12/8 for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Indoor dining only. Parklet seating is in the works.If you're dining in, proof of vaccination is checked against your ID when you're ordering at the counter. Self-seating with self-serve water. Staff wore masks properly. M E N U* Pastries: Donut, cookies, sweet toast, banana bread, etc.* Loaves of bread * Sandwiches: Fried egg, sausage & egg, hot chicken, and veggie dip.* Drinks: Coffee, tea, wine. F O O D* California Hot fried Chicken Sandwich w/ chicken thigh, hot maple crunch, seaweed aioli, slaw, milk bun ($15): bit.ly/3G6NUO8I know everyone and their mama has a fried chicken sandwich on the menu but not many have one with a housemade bun. And, with seaweed aioli....what?!The fried chicken thigh was deliciously crunchy and hella juicy (brined). At first, I was like hmmm, this isn't spicy enough but the heat slowly crept up on me. It's a warming, mild-medium heat with the seaweed aioli adding a cooling, creamy umami layer, maple for a touch of sweetness, coleslaw for freshness, and pumpkin seeds for crunch. The sauerkraut's acidity (side) really helped cut through the richness with each bite.I really liked the toasted housmade milk bun. It was warm and crispy with a fluffy softness. But, the bottom portion was a bit drenched from the spicy oil so I just did without it. I don't need the extra carbs anyways. This is one deliciously satisfying hot chicken sandwich but it can get messy so grab plenty of napkins. They have the nice, soft thick ones. S E R V I C EWarm, welcoming vibes. Even though it's counter service, the staff took the time to check-in with diners. My order took about 10 minutes with no line. A M B I A N C EBright and casual with two-tops, booth seating, and window counter seats. P A R K I N GResidential street parking. Overall, Automat is a great addition to the area. Looking forward to revisiting for dinner when they have their parklet up and running!,Sneak PreviewTuesday - Friday8 am - 3:30 pmHurrah!Deliciousness!Friendly service!Regular hours on 12/8.Automat Breakfast Sandwich is definitely BEST!- the redesigned space is bright and wonderful with sunlight.Welcome to the neighborhood!Update: closed today and tomorrow Dec. 2 and Dec. 3,One of the best work spots in SF that I've been able to find so far. If you're looking for a place to go with your laptop or a book and just sit for hours, this is for you. Ability to work: There are plenty of 2-person tables and one wall has a bar-style of seating where you can look out into the street while you work. There are lots of outlets and wifi. The vibes are extremely cozy and neighborhood-ly, with lots of people walking by outside and lots of people coming in and out of the shop. I found it to be the perfect place to work on my laptop for an extended period of time (we sat here from 9 am to 3 pm when it closed for the afternoon), and we were able to just sit there without being bothered (we ordered coffees and a little lunch too). Food experience: We ordered the burger and it was surprisingly one of the best burgers we've had in SF. Their portions here are huge. We didn't eat too much so I have less to say about the food here. I will say that one of the reasons why we didn't have too much food here is that they don't have many lunch options and some of the already few items were sold out by the time we were ready to order around 12 pm. For those looking for healthier options, there aren't too many here.Ambiance and Environment: Great ambiance, on a sunny day there is a ton of light, and it was consistently bustling from open to close. This would be a great brunch spot for friends because of the energy, but also a great place to people watch a bit as you grind out work or a nice place to tune out everyone as you read a book with one of Automat's huge cookies or sandwiches. Service: Good, nothing special but also didn't have any expectations given this is a casual place.,Come to Automat for their baked goods, especially their focaccia! I've come here 3 different times specifically for their focaccia that seems to change every 2 weeks. It's the best focaccia in the bay area (check out Nabolom in Oakland for a close 2nd) - amazing texture, flavor and creative toppings. Their breakfast sandwich is also masterful. I believe Casey Wentworth is the head baker - amazing job!,Highly recommend this spot! They serve delicious pastry and plenty of seatings. Located on the quieter end of Fell street. Great spot to work :) Plenty of parking available too,Came on a Wednesday morning for breakfast, was able to walk in with no wait. Beautiful spacious interior with a relaxing mid century modern vibe. Food: Zadie's Sandwich - a fluffy light milk bun with a runny fried egg and melted American cheese. Pretty simple but very delicious, would have loved a bit of hot sauce to spice it up but they didn't have any. An added textural element like greens would have been nice. Automat Breakfast Sandwich: two slices of white bread well toasted with square slab of sausage and an omelette. A bit bland sausage could have used more seasoning and crisping. Brick Toast: Delicious, taste like french toast, topped with a rich cheesecake like creme. Little Wedge Gem Salad: Really interesting, crunchy seeds and grains add great texture. Flavor seemed reminiscent of seaweed mixed with green goddess dressing. Garlic pretzel focaccia: brought this home to enjoy, overall pretty tasty, good fluffy crumb and interior with a nice balance of crispy exterior to chewy interior. Overall really enjoyed breakfast at Automat would definitely return to try more on the menu. Just a note 20% gratuity is included for all purchases.,Got takeout on a Thursday afternoon for lunch. It wasn't too busy, and ordering online was easy. I got the California fried hot chicken sandwich, the bulgogi big mac, Zadie's banana bread, and the garlicky pretzel focaccia.The focaccia was huge. The amount of salt was nice, and it was so soft inside. I wish there was more garlic flavor though.The chicken sandwich was amazing. The best I've had in the city. The breading was superb. The chicken was moist and juicy. The bread was soft. The aioli was unique and matched with it so well. It wasn't too spicy which was great. The big mac really smelled like a big mac. The mushrooms were so good that I didn't really miss the meat.The banana bread was heavenly. It was so moist and flavorful. I only wish that it had nuts for a textural component. The staff are really nice. They saw I had a lot to takeout and held open the door for me as I left. I will definitely be back to try more of the menu and for sure for the chicken sandwich and banana bread.,Stopped by for lunch on a Weds. just before noon. Popular and busy. Easy friendly service. After you order and pay you get a number and take it to your table. Gratuity is included in the price as they bus the tables, so no need to add more tip. I tried the fried chicken sandwich and an iced tea. Coffee, wine and beer are on offer as well. They have simple syrup and sugar to add to the tea. I mistakenly ordered hot tea instead of iced and they gave me a cup with ice.Modern, updated interior as it's a newer place. Younger crowd, seemed like a lot of USF students, and folks on laptops thanks to the wifi.Chicken sandwich was amazing. Big, delicious and messy. Fresh fried whole thigh with sweet honey, some special sauce, pickled cabbage and onions on a tasty bun. Get extra napkins as this is messy-licious. Saw fries on a nearby table and they looked great.Fortunately the gender neutral bathroom was clean, large and a good place to wash my hands.Good choice to get something to go for a picnic in the park. Pricey but worth it for high quality, interesting combinations, and well made food.,New neighborhood spot alert!! From what I understand it used to be a pop-up but now has found a permanent home in Nopa (lucky me!). Came on a Wednesday morning around 9am (should have came at 8 when it opened cause half the menu was already sold out!) and waited in line for about ~5 mins. I got the Sourdough Chocolate Chip Cookie ($3 on the menu although they charged me $4), Brioche Donut ($4), and a Honey Tahini Whole Wheat Sourdough loaf ($14). I will also note that they do charge a 20% service fee on top, even for takeout.The cookie was very good, crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle (would have been better to warm, but I couldn't wait on my way home). The strawberry cream cheese donut was also filled with delicious goodness- a bit on the sweeter side. The bread I thought was a bit expensive, but man is it good. It's perfectly baked with a pillowy inside!! You can also taste the tahini, but it's not overbearing. I am a big bread person, and I think this might be my favorite whole wheat in the neighborhood. I could literally eat it plain. Service was quick and super friendly despite the chaos. I will definitely be back to try their garlic pretzel focaccia bread and breakfast sandwiches...as well as their dinner menu when it opens fully :),Amazing! Service: the hostess was friendly and we got seated right away. Our server, Kayla was really attentive and super nice!Food: we were a family of 5 and ordered the following," majority of everything we ordered was fantastic and very delicious!  Our favorites was the fish stick & brick toast. Garlicky Focaccia. 10/10Bulgogi Broccolini 10/10BABY CORN ELOTES 9/10 Tuna Sashimi 10/10 Pancake 10/10SMOKED PORK BELLY 8/10 Grilled Duck 10/10BAKED ROCK COD """"FISH STICK 12/10!!! Cheezy Buddy w/ Fries 10/10Chocolate Chip Cookie 10/10Brick Toast 11/10All in all", we definitely recommend and would visit again!,Came here for the special Fnnch dinner.Food was fun with some really neat takes on classic dishes with portions that were small," but allowed you to sample lots of dishes. Apperently it was a rework of their usual """"Automat"""" course menu. Added a """"Birthday Twinkie"""" for giggles. Everything here is a fun conversation piece", and if you're one for the gram, you'll love it.Our server and the other staff that came to the table were kind, not pushy, and sweet.The only gripe I had was some abrasiveness from the host. After struggling with parking (It's SF, par for the course, mea cupla) we were greeted by the server who first asked why we were there," then let us know """"yeah...I gave away your table...I have the counter or you can wait for later and...I have...well nothing else really.""""  Definitely on me for being late to the res", but I guess it's disheartening as for the special event we had prepaid for our meal weeks ago and was kind a looking forward to enjoying the exhibits with my partner, which we still did but it is weird looking past occupied tables.Seems like the kind of place that because it's new, hot and trendy it does such great business that zero fluffs given about that kinda thing. Give it a try on a normal day? Don't prepay.,I swear I'm not being dramatic - this place ruined my day. I ordered lunch for myself and it was $40.00!?!?!?!?!?!?!? I got a veggie dip sandwich and it was terrible. You can barely hold the sandwich," let alone take a bite out of it. The gross sauce was dripping down by hands and the service doesn't even bring you napkins. Literally need to take a shower to get the sandwich stench off of me. I also ordered """"French fries"""". I don't even know what I was served. The fries were so over done they tasted like salty bricks. The sauce the """"fries"""" came with was okay. I went with two other friends and they had subpar experiences. To make everything worse", I paid then entered a tip. After I did so the cashier told me gratuity was included. ‍I would not recommend this place to anyone.,I know I should be used to the San Francisco price but I just wanna say it anyways. A little pricey for a chicken sandwich but no doubt it really tasted good.,pizza bun was very good would tasted better warmed up. ordered the automat breakfast sandwich the eggs were oddly gooey weird texture (if you're hungover it is not a great choice). got a latte and the mugs are super small so recommend getting it into a togo cup! 3 stars since it was very overpriced for quality of size of coffee and egg texture (but that's sf for you),Although the dinner menu is decent, I don't recommend this restaurant for evening dining because of its unpleasant lighting. The lighting inside is bright and cold, reminiscent of an office building. And red neon lights from the outside MUNI station will pierce the gaze of anyone who dares look towards the north of the restaurant.Staff are great and the restaurant has a lot of style, but come here for brunch unless and until they improve the nighttime vibe.,Really enjoyed our dinner here. Food: we had a few things. Bulgogi broccoli (4/5, missing a kick), scallops (4/5, also missing something), sourdough pancake with sturgeon dip (6/5 soooo delicious), pork belly (5/5, loved the way they cooked and presented it) and rock cod (4/5). Had the semifreddo for dessert (5/5). Drinks: had the gose beer since I love gose. It was great Ambiance and service all great! Looking forward to coming back and trying their famous fried chicken sandwich for lunch,Got there early on Wednesday & the place quickly filled up! I was very impressed of course with the food but also with all the employees, everyone was smiling and very friendly. The vibe is very relaxed, there were couples, groups and families with kids. The food is comfort food with a fusion twist. I had a glass, or two lol of the hammerling sunflower sutra, crisp & bubbly,very nice! We got a bunch of things to share. The cheez buddy (cheese burger) the ricotta gnudi, tasted like springtime! and brown butter seared cabbage, that brown butter sauce was so good! all delish!,We ordered takeout on a Saturday morning. I seen Automat featured in some foodie gram posts and blogs so excited to try it out. The spicy chicken sandwich was yum!  Just the right spicy for me (a lightweight). Not spicy enough for my husband who prefers The Bird & Tokyo Hot chicken's spice level. The bread on this sandwich is great and the chicken is crunchy layered with layers of crunch with slaw and sesame that's really interesting for the mouth.  The fries are really good here -- I don't know what they put in the seasoning, but it is like crack!The brick toast is this big fluffy on the inside, caramelized on the outside toast with the most delectable vanilla cream? Custard sauce? We split the above between 2 adults and 1 4year old and it was satisfying and delicious. It IS pricey when they automatically tack on the 20% service charge as others have mentioned. However, SF is an expensive city and I support businesses that pay theirs employees as living wage.,Bomb food, wide range of price options ($4-40), eclectic;) menu, bake their own bread, and is two feet away from a muni stop. Automat breakfast sando: 5 star hangover foodThere's a bunch of other bugogi/brioche/fancy fish stick stuff on the menu I want to try.20% gratuity on everything including to go, so you know they're willing to lose business to take care of employeesWalking distance from panhandle, golden gate park, usf, painted ladies and divisadero street which had a bunch of fun stuffStoked to go back,Tried the Fried chicken sando today and it was awesome! Definitely one the the best I've had. I'll be telling my friends about this one. And Will be returning for sure.,Had a very dry cheese danish and a cup of coffee. Was also charged a 20% tipping charge. I literally was taking these to go. The tipping culture is outta control in SF, we're all struggling. It was just mediocre. I won't be back.,One of the members of our group was interested in eating here. Although it wasn't crowded when we arrived, there was a long enough line for us to browse the menu and decide what we wanted before placing our order. I chose the chicken sandwich," and there were enough fries for everyone at the party.The chicken sandwich and the chips both had decent quality. I had no idea if the chicken was properly seasoned or if the flavor came from the sauce. Those members of my group who ordered pizza buns stated they were """"""""good",""" but did not exclaim their love for them", and others remarked that it was greasy.However, I wasn't particularly impressed.,Lovely shared meal. It's great to go with more people to try more dishes. Between the six of us, we had 5 smaller plates and 4 bigger plates and two each of the three desserts and everyone walked away satisfied. All the favors were on point. My favs of the evening were the ricotta gnudi (so super fluffy that I wished I had a whole plate to myself) and the little gem wedge (herbed buttermilk dressing is the bomb!). Super friendly service. Only wished they were closer so I can eat here more often!,Have come back a few times now - the chicken sandwich remains my favorite but the other items in their menu are worth exploring too. The breakfast sandwich is solid - the eggs are so fluffy, the bread is excellent, the cheese gooey and the dash of herbs is a nice touch. Not a huge fan of sausage in the sandwich but that might be a personal preference thing. The Zadie's sandwich is also good, although I prefer the fluffy scrambled eggs of the breakfast sandwich. The mushroom bulgogi Big Mac I found underwhelming, too much bread relative to filling and I didn't really like the pairing of the spicy sauce with the cheese.The cinnamon roll was a surprise win for me - I liked how fluffy the roll was and that you could moderate how much cream cheese frosting you wanted since it was slathered on top. The pretzel focaccia is excellent (soft, good flavor) and could make a great showstopper if you ever need to bring something to a potluck. The apple brioche was okay, I wanted more filling relative to the bread. The space remains one of my favorite parts of the Automat experience - nice and airy, casual, with plenty of seating.,Have been wanting to try Automat since it's opening, and I'm glad I did! The food is delicious, you can really tell they take time preparing the highest quality ingredients. My favorites were the fries, chicken sandwich, and cheezy double. The only hesitation I have about automat is the higher prices. There is a 20% automatic gratuity added to any order, so it does add up. Regardless, the price you pay does guarantee a delicious meal. Id come back to try their pastries (they were sold out by noon on a Saturday morning)!,This is hands down the best cuisine you will get wearing flip flops and a hoodie.This has become one of our regular spots since it opened because 1. We can roll out of bed, throw on a baseball cap and go there and 2. The veggie dip sandwich haunts my dreams.The environment is family friendly and casual but the food belongs in a Michelin restaurant. The attention to detail in quality, combination of ingredients, and thoughtful presentation hits a grand slam.If you truly appreciate good food, you will love this neighborhood restaurant.,The chicken sandwich ($15) is so damn good. By their powers combined, it's crispy and crunchy and tender and juicy! I was wildly impressed to say the least. Be warned that it will take them about 20 minutes to make. So worthwhile. The baked goods are also excellent. Faves include the sourdough chocolate chip cookie ($3) and the savory scone ($4).,I know this is a bold statement but Automat might have the best chicken sando I ever had. I only say might because I wish it was spicier, but all the other flavors were top notch! I also ordered the garlicky pretzel focaccia bread. FYI- it's huge!! I did not expect the size when I saw photos online. I wish they sold half a loaf or a slice. The entire pie sized loaf is $12. Brioche donut- I was pleasantly surprised when I bit into the donut and realized there's a cream filling inside. It was sooo good. We went on Saturday at noon and there was plenty of street parking nearby. The line wasn't too bad and there's a bunch of indoor seating.Ooo they serve beer and wine too XD,While taking COVID into account and having some familiarity with restaurant economics and current wage pressures, I still can't recommend coming here.Food cost is one of the LEAST costly expenses in restauranting, yet Automat had a price-to-performance level that is not good for visitors.  I'm not being harsh below, but I am being exactly accurate.The good-quality smashburger is $16. I repeat:  16 full dollars.  Smashburgers aren't known for their size," yet it's the same cost as a fully-dressed 5"""" tall", totally-filling bacon-cheese half-pounder from somewhere else that's similarly working through wage and pandemic issues.  And it's allegedly got cheese on it.  It does, barely.  You literally would not know it was there unless you took the top bun off the burger.  My guess is equal to a Babybel cut in half the long way.The well-crafted hot chocolate was very chocolatey and tasty, but miniscule.  It's $7.  For a serving equal to about half a standard coffee cup.On a super-positive note, the staff was stellar, the front of the house is clean, organized and not noisy when 2/3 full.Automat would be great if it was half the price or double the portions.  YMMV.What's pictured was $29.98 including their well-deserved, 20% tip, charged in advance when ordering.,This place is for some people, but not for me. The chicken sandwich was really messy and oily. The sauce and oil just drip everywhere so make sure you lean over the table as you eat. Your hands will definitely get greasy. The cheesy buddy (their burger) comes with a ton of meat; to the point where the meat doesn't fit in the bun when served to you. Needless to say, the meat ends up falling apart onto your plate (or lap), so this too is really messy. That being said, there are plenty of customers so there must be plenty who like this place.We had 3 people in our group. The bill was $73, including a required 20% tip (2 chicken sandwiches, a cookie, and a cheesy buddy). They give the option to tip more if you want but keep in mind the price displayed at the register includes that tip, which isn't as apparent on the screen. All you see is the total price. Approx $25/person (fries not included) is probably on the high side for me, and is indicative of the prices for other items. Perhaps I'm just going through inflation shock these days, but I think I'll look around for cheaper eats.,PSA: do not online order when hungry. I ordered enough for my entire family + picnic. A couple of my favorites: chicken sando - so super crunchy with sweet brioche bun *chef's kiss, bread with vanilla pudding of some sort - crunchy, sweet, and just scrumptious, beet salad - the ground chicken or something that looked of it was an interesting addition, quiche - spinach and feta, and some mushroom pie thing! Things that costed -1 : greasy burger like I mean soaked bun kinda greasy and overly salty garlic focaccia bread. Either way, I'll most likely be back again! :),My friend wanted to come here for brunch. There's basically nothing here except a vegetarian salad if you can't eat gluten / are gluten free / celiac. I've been medically restricted since 2008, and found over the years most places give folks at least some option, even if you still have to worry about cross contamination. Going to drink my cappuccino and find food elsewhere. Also not a fan of the 20% included gratuity. I usually tip well but at least like to be able to opt in before I pay almost $7 for a cappuccino.,I ordered for pick up the fried chicken sandwich, the pizza bun and the pretzel focaccia. Everything was excellent. The fried chicken sandwich is outstanding, super crispy and so well seasoned. Strongly recommend!,I have eaten here 3 times. 2 breakfasts and 1 dinner. The first breakfast was amazing which made me come back the next 2 times. I ordered their breakfast sandwich the first, it was one of the best ones. Something new. Dinner expectations were high after the first breakfast. We ordered some fries, which were amazing. We got some sourdough pancakes. They were served without any syrup or sauce which meant they were dry to eat. It was something new but not impressive. The entrée was a trout dish, which was supposed to be family style, and was served with less food on the plate than the appetizers. I tasted good but shouldn't say family style. It was served with some base sauce and no carbs. Overall the dinner was nice, but disappointing the price paid and didn't left me satisfied. And my latest breakfast, where I write this review, I ordered the breakfast sandwich again to dissect it in detail. For some reason, I was not impressed the second time. The sandwich was not layered properly, and it broke apart with the first bite. Most annoying thing ever. There was too much sauce in the sandwich, made it all soggy and hard to eat and I ended up making a mess. It had a layer of sausage, which was alright. Not something I was craving maybe. Overall, I think the sandwich is one time order. Overall, the place looks amazing, and I will definitely come back to try something new here. Their pastries looked amazing, which is something on my list to try.,I don't believe in restaurants piggybacking on their sister restaurants (Dynamo--Lazy Bear) but Automat is amazing. From the moment we arrived, it was perfect service. But, more on that later. The food was impeccable and the timing was everything. We ordered 5 things. The big winners were the little gem salad, the pretzel focaccia and the pork chop. I did see other plates served nearby and I had a little fomo so, that seems like a good thing. But, back to the service. If the food was terrible I would have given Automat an amazing review because of our server Jake. He was personable, charming and warm. He killed it at every turn. Professional and genuinely likeable. In a word, perfect. I swear they didn't pay me to say this. Try it. Ask for Jake. Don't mention State Farm.,Please do not go here. They apply an automatic 20% gratuity fee to every order. And this is not even a waited restaurant. You have to pay at the counter. So wrong. My chicken sandwich ended up being $20 with no fries. So I thought this better be the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. Nope. It was dry with no flavor. Lastly, we ordered 5 chicken sandwiches and they gave us 4. It took over 30 minutes for them to give us the last sandwich after having to prove to them we bought 5 and not 4. Everyone finished their food and finally we got the 5th one. If you want a real chicken sandwich, do yourself a favor and go to Hot Bird for the best chicken sandwich in SF. It's actually cheaper than this place.,The people, aesthetics, and food, all just fantastic. The everything bagel sourdough loaf was a spiced revelation, the regular sourdough was also solid though a bit dry (nice graininess to it, tasty crust, mid-range sour), breakfast sandwich was solid but real standout was the vegetarian Big Mac Bulgogi a Korean spiced mushroom animal style sandwich, and then finally garlic pretzel focaccia was just heavenly. Great airy space, nice looking wines, and really cool people as staff, good vibes.,They automatically charge a 20% gratuity to all checks, even if it's all to go. I wouldn't mind that so much if the service was on top of it. Although service is friendly, 2 out of 3 times I have been, they have forgotten completely to make my entree. Both times my friend who was on the same check got their food first. Both times i tried to stay patient but after 30 mins I said something and it is clear they completely forgot. A quick apology was provided but nothing else. Even tho the food is good (although) very heavy and decadent, I doubt I will be back.Also there should be a rule on weekends that people can't sit at tables with just a computer for too long. Our food started coming to us after 15 mins and we still didn't have a table because 4 different people at different tables were working on their computers with no food and empty glasses. I consider this place more of a restaurant than a cafe so I'm surprised they allow that when people have spent over $50 for a meal and can't get a table.,One of the best meals I've had in the city! It wasn't too difficult getting a reservation for 3 a week in advance, and we were seated immediately despite arriving sliiightly over the grace period which I really appreciated. FOODGarlicky Pretzel Focaccia (5/5) - Must order!! Aesthetically this is not the most beautiful looking bread but taste-wise I almost cried a little it was so good. Had to hold myself back from ordering a whole loaf to take home. Little Gem Wedge (4/5) - Crisp and refreshing but I probably wouldn't order it again. We were just craving some veggies and this hit the spot perfectly.Squid Cavatelli (5/5) - Somehow they got the sauce to taste like the ocean. If you're not a fan of really fishy tastes/smells this is definitely not for you, but everyone in my party loves seafood and loved this dish. It was saucy and the pasta had a great al dente mouth feel -- definitely a pretty unique dish.Brick Toast (5/5) - The most amazing way to close out our meal, and the fluffy custard was the cherry on top. This was essentially a thick slice of french bread that's custard-like on the inside, but sugary and caramelized on the outside. Was super buttery and rich so not for the feint of heart, but I loved how there was a bit of saltiness to it too that cut through the richness of the butter and sugar.AMBIENCEThe music was on the louder side here. I was catching up with friends for dinner here and had some trouble hearing them, so wouldn't recommend this for a first date. Definitely great vibes for a more casual get together though. OVERALLMy only regret is going with 2 people who were deeply hungover for dinner, so we weren't able to order as much as I had hoped. The server recommended 2 dishes per person to feel full and we only ordered half the recommended amount, but I will absolutely be back again in the near future to sample the rest of the menu.,"AUTOMAT"""" could alternatively stand for """"automatically charged your tip."""" They take an extra 20% straight up no shame. I wish they'd just make their food more expensive and let us decide if we're going to tip.The burger", no matter how I go about it, is sour tasting overall. I know that awesome beefy cheesiness is in there somewhere, but something sour overpowers it all each time. I just can't get into it, and even tried it on two separate occasions. I love sour beers too, just not sour burgers.The fried chicken sandwich literally tastes like sweet, crunchy powder flakes. It's caked in seasoning so much I could not even taste the chicken. I also generally don't like sweet in my savory but I'm not feeling the balance in this dish. You could take out the chicken and it'd taste the same.There's other interesting things on the menu but I'm just not a fan so far, unfortunately, even though I really want to!On a positive note their ingredients seem fresh and of high quality.I recommend giving them a try and see what you think.,The food and service were great! We came here for dinner with a reservation made a couple weeks back. Though we were quite full from a late lunch, we ordered small plates of the spicy beet salad, garlicky pretzel focaccia, and the pepperoni peppers. Also got the duck (wish the crab was still in season/on the menu)The salad was super generous for a small plate; the blend of flavors and textures from the beets, radicchio, and their homemade croutons were very refreshing! I've never really had any salad similar to this and was pleasantly surprised.Pepperoni peppers had an interesting texture. Almost slimy? but the flavors were poppin! We actually ate this with the focaccia, which tasted more like a soft sourdough loaf rather than focaccia, but still very delicious.The duck was very chewy, and the rhubarb they served next to it reminded me of apple pie? Anyways, I was a little confused with the flavoring of this but nonetheless the duck was good, though I prefer my duck to be a little less chewy. This main dish was on the pricier side of $33.I'll definitely want to come back during lunch, or if I can get another reservation for dinner some time. The menu items are fun to try, and you can try some of the small plates without breaking the bank.,Automat is definitely the new go to restaurant in our neighborhood. We walked past here on a dog walk one morning and it looked delicious and super trendy. They are a coffee shop/ bakery in the morning, make tasty looking lunch like fried chicken sandwiches, and then turn into a lovely vibe date night restaurant in the evening. Tonight we had dinner here and tried a bunch of the small plates - shishito peppers, spicy beet salad, asparagus Caesar, and the sourdough savory pancake. We also got the pork belly dish and sourdough chocolate chip cookies as dessert. Everything we had was delicious and very reasonably priced. Favorite of the night was by far the sourdough pancake. I wanted to eat like 4 of them! The pork belly was awesome - a combo of flavors - jalapeño, grilled pineapple, and tender pork belly with a sweet red sauce. The dessert cookie was also very tasty. We will be coming back regularly to this wonderful new institution. I wish I took photos - presentation of every dish was intentional, simple, and a work of art.,I've come here for both brunch and dinner before, and can say that brunch is 100x better than dinner. The sandwiches are supreme, the breakfast sandwich is the perfect eggy/sausagey combination with that buttered toast, while the hot fried chicken sandwich is a delicious option too. Dinner menu is not as exciting and good as the brunch options IMO!!,Wow - everything is DELICIOUS here! Key tip - order the french fries. They are out of this world perfect with a great fry sauce.,Fried chicken sandwich is $15. The sandwich is average- not amazing but not bad. The chicken is thinner than Hot boys sandwich and is more breaded. However, each order is automatically charged tax and 20% gratuity which brings the sandwich to $20. Steep gratuity considering the organization of the restaurant is self-serve (you order at the front, you pour your own water, etc). Came in with party of 5 and ordered 5 fried chicken sandwiches and 4 were delivered. 4 of our 5 friends had finished their meal while 1 waited over 30 minutes and asked the server. I had to show my credit card statement showing how much I paid, the order number, and direct the server to our order on their iPad in order for them to finally get a 5th sandwich going (that we had already paid for). Overall, food is decent but customer service could be vastly improved esp for 20% gratituity. Won't be coming back again.,Had an amazing dinner at automat tonight. We had the cheeseburger with fries, the sourdough pancake, the short rib, the cavatelli, and the brick toast for dessert.I'd recommend everything, but we especially enjoyed the sourdough pancake and the brick toast. And I loved the dill pickle seasoning on the fries.The service was excellent and the food arrived hot and fresh. I understand that they add a 20% tip to the bill, but I think that is fine. That is really what we should all be tipping these days anyway.,Oh my gosh I've had my fair share of chicken sandwiches in the city and this was one of the best. I can't get over the breading on the chicken...it was soo crispy while the meat was juicy. We also tried the beet salad (I don't eat beets often) and it was also amazing. We finished with the chocolate chip cookie and the sea salt on top really made it special. There were so many other things that sounded good on the menu. I'll definitely need to try them soon.,Super good, makes me more ok with green Chile not being there. The gem salad was awesome, as was the chicken sandwich and breakfast sandwich.,not amazing food. paid about $175 for wholefoods grade food for 2. The service and the waitress was super nice but the food was so so. 3 stars for the service.... none for the menu.,"I went there with a friend who told me that """"they say the chicken sandwich is the best"""". It's both our first visit", so we ordered the chicken sandwich," and it did not disappoint. A wild party of tastes in your mouth kept us entertained and grateful. Finished it with a sour bread chocolate chip cookie that was also very good. Will be back to try the rest of the menu.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nopa,"Squeeze onto the bar and enjoy the burger - it's why you're here. Can be tough to get a table, so plan in advance if you don't fancy your luck.,Bottom line: this place did not disappoint. Most of the reviews and raves were correct about the service, atmosphere, and most importantly the food. Reservation: It's a bit difficult to get an indoor seating reservation so try to plan ahead if you're trying to patron this trendy establishmentService: from start to finish, the service was amazing. The hosting staff was very courteous and quick. Our waiter checked on us frequently and ensured our drinks were filled.Food: most importantly, we tried a little bit of everything. Had some friend chicken, Bolognese, Pork Chop, and dessert! All came out perfectly and aesthetically pleasing. The cut into the pork was juicy and cooked perfectly. Normally these type of meats end of dry but the temperature on the meat was good and the vegetables that accompanied it was seasoned nicely. Definitely a MUST visit when you're in town!,My favorite restaurant space on my favorite corridor of the San Francisco. Such a beautiful restaurant and it truly does feel like a gathering place in the center divide of the city. I love that the mains are relatively fixed, while the starters are seasonal, everchanging, and where the restaurant's creativity and uniqueness shine. California cuisine through and through. Minus one star as the food is however not always consistent. The amount of times I've had to send back the burger after asking for it medium rare is a huge head shake. But don't be afraid to ask for your needs in life, folks, as the service is always good here and they will ensure you eventually get what you desire, and more.,I've heard about this place for a while and finally got reservations to this place through Open Table and I will say the food is good but not absolutely ""amazing."" Over all hit or miss for us and this is why: I will say though that the cocktails were indeed AMAZING, pricier price point but amazing for sure. So u would recommend going here for nice drinks if you are looking to take someone out somewhere with an elevated ambiance and innovative drinks that is worth the bang for your buck - this is the place. Food wise like I said it was good but wasn't better than some other places I've been with a lower price point. The pork chop was actually kind of salty, moist, perfectly cooked but salty for sure. I liked the house made pappardelle actually but I felt like I had better at other more authentic Italian places in the city. The desserts though - AMAZING, they used very creative flavors and the guava tartlet we had with the scoop of cream cheese ice cream was sooooooo good! I still think this place is worth a try and would probably come back to try their other dishes.,You absolutely have to make a reservation well in advance for NoPa. I had heard rave reviews, so I finally made my way here. The ambiance here is excellent, and the decor is so lovely, with a tree in the middle. The service is great, as expected. We ordered the roasted vegetable tagine and the roasted black cod. - Roasted vegetable tagine: very generous portion; the vegetables were perfectly cooked. I particularly liked the Meyer lemon yogurt atop the tagine. I could eat spoonfuls of that. Overall, a very comforting meal. I would order something else next time, but only because I want to try other things on the menu too, but I would recommend it! - Roasted black cod: My friend really liked this! The fish was perfectly roasted, and the vegetables were perfect too.,A great place to chill with your Friends.. very local .. a bit tight from table set up .. 7 appetizers we ordered 1) FRIED BRUSSELS SPROUTS, LEMON AND PARMESAN a MUST 2) WARM MARINATED OLIVES Olive Lovers3) DUCK RILLETTES, QUINCE PASTE AND GRILLED BREAD more than enough as this is soooo good4 ) I'll pass on the salad as others on the menu are really good 5 ) if your a group of friends get a bottle!!!,This place has a cool factor to it, but we weren't too impressed with our meals. Had one of the better seats in the bar, at the top level looking over all the action. Our drinks and the goat cheese appetizer were delicious! If I were to come back, this is all I'd eat. Especially for the price. The Moroccan spiced chicken was good, but not sure if $29 worth for 4 pieces. The flatbread was sorta a joke, presentation looks like someone dropped it and then put it back on the plate lol. Taste was good, but not a lot of of food and very bready pieces.Come here for the aesthetic, but it's not the best restaurant on Divis.My star rating:5  - must go!!! 4 - liked it, give it a try!3  - it was alright2  - I probably won't go back 1  - turnaround and run,3.5/5 - decent food with some outstanding dishes, decent drinks, cute interior but definitely pricey. MUST make reservations.Ambiance: *Sat outside but the inside looks incredibly cute*; even with the warmers above the tables it still gets really chilly so make sure to bring layers if you will be outsideService: standard - no complaints. Our server definitely knew the menu which was really helpful; her suggestions on drinks and dessert were much appreciatedFood: The good: the trout salad was absolutely amazing. Flatbread and Fried chicken were also very very good. The persimmon dessert was to die for. The meh: The Pork Chop - the pieces i got (we split amongst 4 ppl and i didnt get any of the fatty pieces) were really dry unfortunately. Flavor was good but i kept guzzling water to help get the meat down.I know this is what they are known for, but i would not order this again. Bread was good but not amazing.,My oh my cocktails are amazing, foods delicious and the atmosphere is great.  The only thing that sucks is you'll almost always have to make a reservation in advance to get a table.  However, there is a communal table, but even that can be tough.  But back to the food and drinks.  The Blue Bottle coffee cocktail is a must and a drink menu staple.  Even if you're not the biggest coffee cocktail fan, it's worth it.  A perfect blend and the coffee is not overwhelming.I've eaten here many times, and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu like the pork chop and roasted chicken.  But maaaaan, their burger is still my go to.  It's always cooked just perfectly and I love the brioche roll it's comes on w/ super flavorful aioli.,I brought some friends from out of town here last Thursday night. Due to the weather, we were lucky enough to get reservations the night before. We got there 2 hours early since we were already in the area, and they did not turn us away and took such good care of us! We even got seated an hour earlier than our reservation. Hands down, the service is phenomenal here. They took care of our coats and did not rush us during our dinner (which tends to happen a lot close to the end of the night) The meal was obviously great, the food here is so fresh and simple and executed so well.,Came here to celebrate my boyfriend's new job and has an absolutely wonderful experience.We had a reservation for two for 8:30, but for some reason our reservation wasn't ready yet. We were however invited to sit at their bar, and start by ordering some drinks. Although some might see this as an inconvenience, I found it wonderful as I was able to talk to the bartender myself, and find a delicious cocktail that I enjoyed. Everyone at the bar was kind, fast, and even provided us with menus and water, even though we were to be seated shortly.We then were seated (inside, instead of our reserved table outside but I wasn't complaining! in fact, I was glad we were put inside. the vibes were immaculate). We started with the tomato bruschetta which was fresh, juicy, and incredibly flavorful.For our main course, we split the Moroccan Fried chicken and the 8 hour bolognese. We were pleasantly surprised to find that they had already split the spaghetti into two plates for each of us to enjoy. It made it a lot easier to split and appreciate the dish. The Moroccan fried chicken was delicious, especially paired with the spiced honey sauce. However, I found it to be a little bit over-fried, with the breading being a little hard, and falling off the chicken. The bolognese however, was one of the best dishes I've ever had. It was so complex and delicious and flavor, the noodles were perfectly cooked, and the sauce was perfectly balanced.We ended our dinner with two of their delicious and gooey chocolate chip cookies, as well as a couple of espresso shots. It was the perfect cap to an amazing meal.I can't wait to come back and try their ever changing menu.,Came by for dinner the other night and it was a fantastic experience. Nopa is one of my favorite spots in SF with a new Californian farm-to-table concept.Made a reservation via OpenTable and our table was ready upon arrival. Both indoor along with heated outdoor parklet dining are available. There is a communal table along with bar seating that is available for walk-ins at 5:30 pm; hence the long lines at 5:30 pm right when the doors open. There also is a mezzanine level too.Street parking is available and can be tricky. Best to arrive early and park a few blocks away.Service by the staff is always excellent starting from suggestions on the menu to checking up on us throughout the evening.Started off with the fried halibut the other night and it was excellent. Lightly breaded half a dozen pieces of fish along with a side of aioli. This was a new addition to the menu.Moved on to the mushroom toast and it was also excellent. The bread was a thick piece of super fresh bread over a bed of super delicious mushrooms along a light vinaigrette. For the main, opted for the classic pork chop which was world class. The pork chop was super thick, was bone-in, and cooked to a perfect medium/medium rare. This is the best spot for a pork chop in SF. The potatoes and swiss chard complemented this phenomenally. Definitely a must try.For the secondary main, opted for the eggplant parmesan and was blown away how perfectly executed this was. The eggplant was super fresh, the tomatoes were fresh and the bread crumbs were excellent with a nice crisp from the oven.Ended the meal with a fig tart which was also excellent. The tart was super flaky and the figs were super fresh.~$80/head after tax and gratuity.,This place did not live up to its hype at it. We walked in for date night on Friday around 7:30pm with no reservations, and luckily we got seated instantly without a wait. Unfortunately, we both agreed that dinner here was just okay at best and not memorable at all.We started off with some cocktails and shared the blueberry warm goat cheese crostini appetizer. I didn't like the cocktails I tried, but the crostini was pretty good! The warm goat cheese melts in your mouth, and the crostini was perfectly crispy. However, the blueberries didn't really complement this dish well. For mains, we shared the Moroccan fried chicken, pork chop, and veggies. The fried chicken was good in terms of flavor, but the meat was slightly dry. At the same price point, the fried chicken at Blue Plate is so much more moist and tastier than the fried chicken at Nopa. Meanwhile, the pork chop here was disappointing because it tasted bland, and I didn't even want to consume more than a couple bites. Lastly, I don't remember the name of the vegetable side dish I got because it wasn't memorable at all.After hearing great things about Nopa for years, I was very disappointed with my dinner experience here. While the service was good, sadly the food left a lot to be desired.,After living in the neighborhood of NOPA for 2 years, I FINALLY got the chance to dine here! I'm always a little hesitant going to more upscale restaurants, but after hearing all the hype, I'm so glad I was able to try it out before I moved!NOPA is definitely on the pricier side, but they make up for it with great quality food and excellent service. You pretty much have to make a reservation in advance, or else you'll end up waiting a WHILE for a table (I once asked a different time and they gave me a 3 hr wait omg).The inside is very warm and bustling - the tables are lil crowded together, but glad to know they're squeezing as many ppl in side as they can lol.Now for the food, it was excellent. Here's what I got:- FRENCH FRIES - I'm a fries fanatic, but these weren't my favorite. A little too crispy, and not potato-y enough. However, the sauces were quite yummy!- BRUSSEL SPROUTS - super crispy and delicious! would order again- PORK CHOP - VERY GOOD! Definitely on the pricier side, but I saw so many Yelpers recommend this entree, so I decided to try it. It was beautifully cooked and sooooo juicy on the inside. It felt like it really melted in my mouth. Salivating now just thinking about it. The potatoes and the strawberry sauce were also delicious.- CHOCOLATE CAKE - nice and thick and rich, but not as memorable as the pork chop lolol- My friends also ordered the FRIED CHICKEN - and its verrrrry good. another great entree option. the skin is super crispy and very well spiced & the chili honey is SO GOOD.,Great service here. Staff were very attentive. I spent ~$100 with entree and dessert, splitting appetizers, $125 riseling (that I was told is hard to find), and corkage fee $35.Priced at $26 for a cheeseburger and fries, it BETTER be good. And hey, it WAS. My medium rare patty couldn't have been done more on point. The pickled oinion was a nice touch. They give you a side of ketchup and pesto. The fries were fluffy and crunchy. I usually only eat several fries but I was finished half of my fries along with half of my burger. The burger was massive and this entree was comfortably enough for two meals for me. For appetizers, we shared fried little fish, beans, and flat bread. The flatbread was my favorite, wonderfully cheese with thin slices of crunchy apple. The fish was fried well. The beans were okay. For dessert, I had the fig leaf ice cream with melon granitas. I admit I regretted getting this ice cold dessert while sitting outdoors without a jacket and the granitas and strudel crumbs were okay but the ice cream was the best part. Wonderfully creamy. Food is good enough depending on what you order but pricey for what it is.,Wonderful restaurant. I had been wanting to try this for a long time and I ended up getting a reservation really late on a Friday night. Buzzy atmosphere. Our waitress was very friendly and helped us navigate the menu. I wish, as many of these types of restaurants, that there were more vegetarian options. The crostinis were amazing. The baked beans were OK. The vegetable stew was nice, almost like a chili. The waitress did mention that if you have several vegetarian's in your group, you can let the restaurant know beforehand, and they may be able to accommodate more dishes. I also wish there was more room in the front to wait, there. You can wait at the bar.,Nopa is amazing!! A great spot for date night. You can tell the chefs put a lot of thought into the menu. The drinks were really good too.,Headline: DO NOT GET THE BURGER Had to make sure that was seen first. The positive is that Nopa has a cool atmosphere in a good part of town. We also had some appetizers that were solid (although way overpriced). My cocktail was awful with the taste and texture of melted ghee. Our food also took over an hour to come out after ordering and when it did...gosh. We ordered the burger ($26!) and the duck ($42). The duck was pretty decent. Tender and good flavors, but nothing unique nor delicious. The burger was actually one of the worst meals I've ever gotten at a restaurant of any level. Without exaggeration, any fast food burger would top this atrocity. If it wasn't taken off our bill, this would be a 2* review. And it's probably the most expensive burger I've ever ordered. Management if you're reading this, please do something. Anything.,Nopa is a restaurant that focuses on combining quality, seasonal ingredients without over amplifying their menu. I got their smoked tomato Caesar salad, warm goat cheese and brie, and the pappardelle bolognese. All of which were amazing. The smoked tomato caesar salad was a dish I enjoyed more than expected. The goat cheese was good - a little thick to where it was hard to spread on the crostini but the flavors with the fresh fig and blackberries were great. The pappardelle was exactly as expected in a delicious, hearty home-cooked bolognese. I also appreciate that Nopa has a changing menu based on the season while also having their staples that they always offer. I think Nopa is a very unique restaurant where every meal you have there can be different yet always maintaining its high quality!,Made reservations on a Wednesday night and the place was packed. Great to see a SF staple still generating good business. Their menu changes daily depending on ingredients.Smokin 'Beats: their take of an ol'fashioned served up. Delicious!The best approach to take on their menu is to do family style. The left side of the menu are appetizers, top right are entrees and bottom right are sides.Tried their flatbread, brussel sprouts and fries. All were solid, especially the flatbread.Since we were a large party, we were able to try their moroccan spiced fried chicken, pappardelle with bolognese and squash, smoked brisket with celery root puree, pork chop and apple sauce. I wouldn't say any of the dishes really blew my mind and the brisket and fried chicken are especially pricey for the size and quality.Overall, if I came back, I would skip the entrees and just get a variety of appetizers.,Nopa is a mainstay of Divisco (the Divisidero Corridor) and consistently offers some of the best food in the 'hood, and arguably the best cocktail program in the city.  Also, you can't beat the atmosphere - Nopa is packed 7 days a week.  Recently we came to celebrate a birthday and the experience was perfect.  The menu changes daily, so you're likely to find similar items week to week, with slight tweaks based on ingredients that are available and seasonality.  We started with two cocktails (Sneak Peak, and Smokin' Beats) - both were incredible!  We shared the wood grilled pork chop and the wood grilled steak.  Both were incredible.  We lated agreed that this might have been the best pork chop we'd every had!  Unfortunately the sides (potatoes, sliced apple, and house made sauerkraut) were only OK that night.  The steak was the opposite, although perfectly cooked, and very good, the sides stole the show - (roasted carrots, broccolini, and celery root puree) were off the charts!  We finished with the sundae, which, was a little much (though unique and delicious).Honestly, this place is one of my top-10 restaurants in SF.  I'm always subtly ""wow'd"" and never leave disappointed (by the food or service).,Food is just okay - definitely does NOT justify their high price. Terrible Service. Just a few examples: (1) It took them about 30 minutes to take our first drink order.  (2) It took them 40 minutes to bring our first ordered bottle of wine - and then, they needed a special person to open the wine bottle so once we got the bottle on the table we had to wait another ~10 min for someone to open it. Totally unnecessary. And it's not like the person who opened the bottle was a connoisseur or someone giving us some type of facts or history on the wine. She basically just opened the bottle and that's it. (3) And the second bottle of wine we ordered (ordered about 10 minutes prior to receiving our main dishes) arrived on our table once we were almost done eating. I would not go back there and I would not recommend it. 2 stars because the atmosphere is good, and the food is not terrible - it's just ""okay"" (too expensive for what it is, though!),I went to the restaurant and I felt that there were racist undertones when it came to sitting patrons. I was told that tables were for people who had reservations only, but that was not the case for some. I will never go here again. We waited 45 minutes for a table and another 20 min for drinks. Do not recommend.,I'm not sure what happened but what a shame. I feel like the food quality is very subpar combined with the high prices equals not worth it. Had a reservation at 5:30 pm on Wednesday evening and had a short wait which was understandable given the line of people. We were seated upstairs and at first glance couldn't help but notice that the other 2 tables were Asian as well. Definitely felt a bit odd and segregated by being upstairs while all of  the customers downstairs were Caucasian. There were 2 other tables upstairs but they were of mixed ethnicities and the last table were all Caucasian.Felt it was odd that the manager went up to the Caucasian and mixed tables but didn't say anything to the other 3 tables. Now onto the food, ordered the Josey Baker Bread which was good and the corn salad which was refreshing and had great flavors. The flatbread was good as well but that's it.The cheeseburger was medium rare but was dry. Also, for it to take 45 minutes to come out was ridiculous.House made pappardelle, bolognese was very underwhelming. The meat sauce was salty to point of not edible. The pasta was good but was basically just eating pasta and broccolini. The service was pretty good. But all of the above did not make for a nice dining experience. Did not even bother ordering any dessert.,Really so scrumptious. What I like most about Nopa is that they have an elegant, beautifully presented menu but without the pretentiousness. The vibes are trendy and bustling--this place was very full on a Friday night and we had to make the reservation a few weeks in advance. They have both indoor and outdoor parklet seating with heaters. You don't have to get super dressed up or think about things too formally here, and yet the quality of the food reflects fine dining. Of course, the price of your meal will also match the quality (expect about $75-100 per head) but if you want to treat yourself, this is a lovely option in Hayes Valley!Parking as with anywhere in the neighborhood, is very painful, so come 15min in advance and be prepared to pay $20 for a lot or fight for a street spot like we did lol. The menu rotates seasonally so I found a lot of corn, romano beans, basil, and tomatoes featured in July. Love that! It also meant there were a lot of new entrées that I couldn't necessarily find reviews for so we just kind of ordered by what sounded good--of course you can't go wrong at a place like this. The portions were surprisingly big. Our app of Kennebec fries for example, was HUGE. I wasn't complaining; they were so crispy and delicious. You could share this with 4 people. We also tried:Wood Baked Butter Beans: kind of a tomato-based casserole with a crunchy panko topping. Braised Pork Fusilli: a smaller side-sized portion but delicious nonetheless. Pasta was perfectly al dente and the seasoning wasn't too salty. Eggplant parmesan: very elevated, not greasy. Lots of cheese and sauce, yum!Sweet corn pot de crème for dessert: unique and kinda of sweet-salty. Would recommend if you're obsessed with corn like I am. Malted chocolate ice cream: sooo rich and creamy and good. The portion was gigantic as well (3 scoops!) so I'd definitely order this to share with multiple people next time. Ay Bay Bay cocktail: forgot to snap a pic, but we ordered this twice because of the name. It's strawberry, clarified coconut milk, and of course a bay leaf. Delicious and strong. I want to try their other drinks next time for sure. My biggest complaint is the service. I understand the slow food nature of this place but every single item took so long to come out. It was about half an hour between our appetizers and entrées. We were seated for about 2.5 hours total because of all this waiting time for the food, dessert, and check.That said, our server was kind so we tipped well but it seemed like the tables next to us were getting served much more quickly by other servers. The busboys who came over to grab empty plates and clean any spills were so friendly and accommodating as well. We will absolutely be back to explore their autumn menu. Highly recommend for a special occasion dinner but if you don't want to be too formal: a loved one's birthday, an anniversary, a hot date. Hip restaurant with a cool atmosphere and fresh, well-curated food. They will be super impressed!,Nopa lived up to the hype!  Normally I'd never order pork chop, but theirs is so beloved that we had to give it a try -- it was huge, very juicy, and complemented very nicely with tart tomatoes. The real standouts of the night were our two starter dishes, though. The combination of duck liver mousse and strawberries on toast? All of my favorite things. The flatbread was also incredible - really nice cheese and the kick of the peppers made it extra memorable. Overall, hearty portions and delicious food; it's clear why Nopa has remained an SF staple. It is insanely loud inside, but I suppose that is part of the Nopa experience :-)Dined: July 18, 2022,The ambiance and food were magic. But what really did it for us was the service. Ashwini created the best possible experience we could have had. She recommended all the greatest things but didn't pressure us into anything. She was so kind, fun, and attentive. A true 5 star experience.,Nopa is great! I've never gone at a reasonable dinner time, but it's pretty easy to walk in late night and get a spot at their big shared table! The first thing I have to mention is that their service is exceptional! Last time I went I had one of the best waiters I've ever had - she was kind, funny, and gave great recommendations!I've had a few of their starters and they're all good, but what you really need to know about is the burger. This is probably my favorite burger in San Francisco. It's a really big fat patty on a nice bun, with good toppings and great fries. The first time I came here, I ordered the burger medium rare and it came out very rare - like the middle wasn't just pink, it was straight up raw meat. This isn't my preferred way to cook a burger, but I ate it anyway and was blown away by how delicious it was. The next time we came, my boyfriend and I wanted to guarantee that we got the burger the same way, so we ordered it rare. This time it came out well done - no pink in sight. We ate it anyway and again, blown away. No matter how they cook it, their burger patties are so juicy and flavorful. You'd think I'd be mad by this inconsistency, but I honestly can't be, because both burgers I had were exceptional. Getting reservations here would be a good move, but I really just recommend it for when you're out on Divis!,totally lives up to the hype. i had been here a few years ago for brunch (which they no longer do!) but dinner blew me away. we got the mushroom toast, goat cheese, fried chicken, fries, and broccoli. everything was amazing. i feel like i can still taste the chicken on the tip of my tongue and want to eat it forever!,My gf and I had a really nice date night at Nopa. We were a little late to our reservation because we couldn't find parking, but we were seated without an issue. The restaurant had high ceilings, a nice open kitchen, and was very lively. Lamb Riblets: I'm not a big fan of lamb, but the lamb riblets were great. The lamb was incredibly tender and fell off the bone. It was also seasoned perfectly. If on the menu, I would definitely get this! Moroccan Fried Chicken: Great dish to share as the portion was pretty big. The chicken was very juicy and crispy. I could tell the quality of the chicken was much better than most places. The flavor itself was a little bland as it tasted under seasoned. However, it came with delicious spicy honey on the side, which helped the flavor. Burger: The burger was pretty good, but definitely not the best. The meat itself was very juicy and cooked perfectly medium rare. Since the meat was so juicy, the bun was a little soggy. The cheddar was great as it was perfectly sharp. The burger also came with fries, and they were decent. Considering the cost, I probably wouldn't order this again. Overall, each dish was made from very high quality ingredients and the service was excellent.,Ok, finally got to Nopa. It was definitely an error on my part not getting there sooner. And yes, you must try the fried chicken. It is the best ever. But one must also give another couple of entrees a try, as well as some fantastic cocktails!   I highly recommend the Little Fried Fish and the Duck Liver Mousse. As an aficionado of the Japanese style of cooking small fish, I loved the LFF.  Skip the sauce it comes with and eat the LFF right out of the basket while still warm. Fantastic! And the mousse, oh so good. Then there's the cocktails, I'll confess I had too many, including all three of their Bee's Knees Week limited cocktails. Get there before those are off the menu.  Also recommend the pork chop, cooked perfectly and the lamb tartare. But if you're having only one entre, go with the fried chicken! Great service and great food in a happening atmosphere. Do enjoy!,Had high hopes for this place but did not live up to it. The beet salad was probably the most memorable. The pork chops and ducks were done very well but they both weren't dishes that wowed me. What ruined it for me was honestly the dessert -- the meal was quite heavy so we wanted something light and chose the sorbet. BUT the sorbet literally tasted like Haagen Dazs raspberry sorbet. I hope restaurant can improve on the dessert menu!,Came here at 5:30 on a Friday, party of 2, without any reservations and got seated right away at the communal table. The place is great but I wasn't a fan of the food. Cocktails are pretty pricey $18 each & didn't really taste that great. I got the beet cocktail. Food was very meh. The fried fish was just anchovies or sardines and batter. No real flavor or seasoning on top of it except a dip & the French fries were very dry and disappointing. It was a huge French fry portion though.,Nopa is a classic American brasserie with Mediterranean influences, so named after the San Francisco neighborhood in which it resides on the corner of Divisidero and Hayes Streets. The NoPa neighborhood stands for North of the Panhandle, which is near the narrow eastern strip of Golden Gate Park that has hip cafés, quirky shops and colorful Victorians most notably the Painted Ladies which is located in nearby Alamo Square. Chef Lawrence Jossel has been curating his organic wood-fired cuisine for over a decade and a half now and the buzz he created when they first opened is still here as we recently came on a weeknight evening for dinner and the place was still buzzing both inside their dining room, and the massive outdoor parklet they created along Hayes Street, which is where our party of six were sat, thanks to being able to make reservations at no extra charge on their website via OpenTable. The dinner menu at Nopa is fairly simple as their smaller dishes or appetizers are on one side of their menu and their entrées and sides are on the other side of their menu. To start our meal, we opted to order two suggestions from our server, including their Flatbread topped with Nopa bacon, Padrón peppers and cheddar, and their Roasted Corn Salad, which was topped with Green Plums, avocado and spiced chickpeas. I loved their Flatbread as it was warm and tasty with every bite thanks the abundance of ingredients that topped every small bite. For 22 dollars it was a nicely priced deal that easily could have served as a full meal for any one diner. The salad, although well composed and prepared, was a bit on the smaller side and therefore not the most sharable dish and not worth the 19 dollar price point.Then it was time to decide what entrée each of us would order, and although a number of options sounded delectable, we broke out into two camps, pasta and protein. I opted to order their Country Pork Chop served with Roasted Summer Squash and Stone Fruit Mostarda, others in my dining party opted to order their House Made Pappardelle topped with a nine hour Bolognese and dragon tongue beans, and their Moroccan Spice Fried Chicken served with Chili Honey, in addition to a side of Kennebec French Fries, which was served with a side of Basil Parmesan Aioli. To pair with our meal some of us ordered a little libation including their Alebrije, which was a combination of Morro Espadin mezcal, apricot shrub, cacao, espelette and lemon, and their Pisco Punch which was a combination of Quebranta Pisco, pineapple gum, preserved meyer lemon cordial, and makrut lime leaf. Our meal came out in due tim",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
, and the Pork Chop was a thick cut of meat cooked medium rare to medium just the way I like it and when combined the generous amounts of squash and stone fruit, it made for the most delectable and reasonably priced meal. I got a little sample of their Pappardelle and it was a rich combination of noodles, sauce and meat that tasted perfectly. We actually enjoyed so much food that everyone in our party had a little bit of extra food to take home with us.Then it was time for dessert, and we previously let our server know that we had a birthday in our party and our server graciously complimentary gifted our recipient a scoop of their Malted Milk Chocolate Ice Cream. We were all so enamored with a little amuse bouche of sweets that we decided to split two more desserts. We opted to order their Dark Chocolate Pudding Tartlet which was topped with a passionfruit mousse, pistachios, and roasted strawberries, and their Warm Peach Crumble which was topped with toasted almonds, raspberries and a scoop of vanilla bean bay leaf ice cream. We loved all of the compositions of the desserts as it was the perfect combination of sweet and savory with that extra kick of flavor. Every dish we experienced this evening was so perfectly composed that it proves that Nopa has still not lost any of the rustic homemade flavors that put it on the map those many years ago when they first opened. They contributed to the overall rebirth of the area that continues to bustle with a number of other restaurants and bars that are as equally at home as Nopa is, and this includes their sister Mexican restaurant Nopalita, which is mere block and a half away. This is my third time at Nopa, but first in over a decade, and it remains as good as it was the first time I went, and I didn't even get to rave over their signature Wood Grilled Cheeseburger, which had me coming back for more and no doubt is one of the best in town. At Nopa, they've become almost a neighborhood destination for locals and out-of-towners alike, and after decades of success, I don't see them slowing down anytime soon.,I have been wanting to have dinner at Nopa for a while now. It is always so hard to get a reservation at a decent time. I was finally able to get a reservation for 8:15 last night, which is still on the later side but earlier than the availabilities I usually see. My friend and I shared the pork chops and the bucatini pasta. We also got the Ay Bay Bay cocktail. I didn't particularly enjoy the cocktail and that is partially why I took one star off. The cocktail was quite strong and I personally didn't love it. I still enjoyed the coconut flavor but felt the alcohol was way too empowering to truly enjoy it.  As for the pork chops and bucatini pasta, we loved them! The pork chops were cooked to perfection. The outer layer was somewhat crispy and the inner meat was juicy and tender. There was corn, peaches, and some beans on the side and corn topped on the meat. It was overall a delicious dish.   The bucatini pasta was also very decadent and delicious. It had so many different textures and flavors. It was nice and creamy and the pasta was the perfect al dente. The peas and mushrooms were yummy and paired well with the cream and pasta. Overall we enjoyed this dish a lot as well.  One of the other reasons I took off a star was because it took a little over an hour for our food to come out and we put in our orders the first time the server came to us. The other tables around us had a similar experience, so I know my table wasn't alone in this.,Well frick. That was excellent. Service was perfect, recommendation by bartender of the burger was perfect (and honest), drinks were fabulous. Nothing to gripe about, only things to be pleasantly pleased (and stuffed) about. Thanks nopa!,Nopa Ratings: 4.2/5Food: 4.75/5 - NOPA has always been on my list of MUST try restaurants in SF. My boyfriend and I came here with four other friends, and we had a fabulous time here. We loved the food, good vibes, and great and consistent service they provided. We ordered a variety of small dishes and appetizers a la carte and shared them family style. See the items we got for dinner that night. - Warm Goat Cheese [GET]: One of my favorite dish of the evening. The goat cheese is warm, creamy, and airy; it got a texture of a chocolate mousse almost. There's medjool dates on top, shinko Asian pear and olive oil crostini on the side. Make sure to get a bite with everything. All the flavors pairs extremely well with each other. The Asian pear makes the goat cheese more refreshing and the crostini added a nice crunchy texture to it. This is a MUST try small dish. - Mushroom Toast [GET]: If you are a big fan of mushroom, then this is perfect for you. The mushroom was grilled perfectly, seasoned-well and fresh. The toast was buttery, pillow-y, and warm. The caramelized onions and balsamic dressing added a nice sweet and tangy flavor to the toast. Finally, the melted ricotta cheese on top was an amazing touch to it too.- Smoked Trout [GET]: This is a refreshing salad, perfect for an appetizer or even as an entrée. Dish is interesting, which consist of a soft boiled egg with a running egg yolk, beet hummus, and topped with cara cara and rye crumbs. The highlight was the beet hummus. It was sweet and complimented the smoked flavor of the trout very well. I like the crunch, crisp, and mixture of all ingredients, definitely gave the dish lots of different textures. - Country Pork Chop [GET]: Probably one of the best pork chop you will find in SF. It was unbelievably tender, juicy, and grilled to perfection at medium rare. It was a huge size too. There's a nice char from the burnt, nice crunch from the toasted farro, and slight sweetness from the flame raisins. They all pairs nicely with the sauce and the wilted greens underneath the pork chop was amazing. - Local Dungeness Crab [SKIP]: This dish was average. The Dungeness crab was tasty and freshly prepared topped with blood orange, fennel, and cara cara. I think there was a slight dressing on the crab, but not too noticeable and a bit bland. Honestly, I just cannot justify the portion and the flavors to the price listed. Save your money for something else on the menu.  Ambiance: 4.25/5 - We sat outside in one of the booths, and although it was chilly, there's heaters available to warm us up. It still got a good and cozy atmosphere. The interior is chic, modern, and stylish with a fancy yet still somewhat casual atmosphere. There's an second floor as well, so if you are looking for a date spot, then NOPA is the place to go. Price: 3.75/5 - We got some small dishes to share such as the warm goat cheese, mushroom trout, and local Dungeness Crab for $18,$19 , and $25 respectively. I got the smoked trout for $19, and my boyfriend got the pork chop for $36. Prices are on the more expensive side, but I think some dishes are worth the try. Service: 4.25/5 - The service was way better than expected, and staffs are welcoming and well-trained. Our server was attentive and polite too, filled up our water glasses each time. The food also came out in a timely manner. They gave us new plates and silverware each time we get a new course. BLUF: A decent experience here for sure. Lots of tasty food, amazing vibes, and great customer service. In terms of the dishes on the menu, I would recommend the warm goat cheese and the country pork chop. I will probably, maybe return again, but not anytime in the foreseeable future. I am just not crazily craving for the food at NOPA. If this is your first time, then go try it out, and make sure to make a reservation, because it is packed every night, especially on the weekends.,Five stars, all around. This place is amazing. It's a perfect date night spot or to come with a large group so you can try more! It's a bit loud, but on Divisadero, so there's a lot around if you want to walk after getting stuffed. Nopa is a farm to table restaurant with a constantly changing menu. It's nice that they design menus based on the quality of food that they receive, but I had so many delicious dishes that I'm sad I may not see again. We ordered: - Country pork chop - great, very tender- Bucatini - LIFE CHANGING pasta. Very rarely do I love a pasta dish, but this bucatini will stand out in my mind for quite a long time. - Duck rillettes - I love duck- Local Dungeness crab - my least favorite dish of the meal. Still good, but not as memorable I would highly, HIGHLY recommend Nopa. You should try to make a reservation a little in advance, because it's always busy! I love how they keep the menu fresh, it makes it an easy decision to come back.,Staff and crew were really nice. We walked in without reservations at dinner time on a busy Saturday and they accommodated us immediately. Cheeseburger is a little bit dry. I love their pastas. The breading of their fried chicken's a bit hard. But overall, nice ambiance with wide array of drinks from their bar.,After months of wanting to try this place out, we were finally able to get a reservation for Friday night around 8:30 pm, and even though the time was fairly late, this place was still super duper busy! Once seated we ended up ordering:*pork chop - absolutely delicious, crispy and juicy with all the best flavors. The chili sauce thing was super yummy and the broccolini and fingerling potatoes just added a nice crunch and texture. *burger - we got this with Gruyère cheese, bacon and avocado and overall this was yummy, but not my favorite. This also came with fries*pavlova dessert - this was coconut pavlova with a raspberry sorbet and this was super yummy and flavorful*dark chocolate cake with espresso ice cream - this was more average but not bad and went well with the toffee chips it came withOverall, food was great and service was also amazing!,I ate dinner here with friends during the week and had a nice time. Definitely make a reservation far in advance because even on a Wednesday it was crowded and we booked about 2 weeks out. We got the bruschetta and corn salad to start, both of which were really tasty. There were 3 of us dining and we split 2 entrees and it was the perfect amount of food. We ate the fried chicken and the papparadelle. In my opinion the food is definitely worthwhile, although prices seem a little steep for what it is. Great spot for a date night or upscale dinner with friends!,Nopa = Flavor Burst Was in the area at Alamo Square and needed to get some food. I have heard some great things about Nopa and wanted to try it out.We didn't have a reservation and were able to get seated immediately around 8pm on a Wednesday. We sat at the community table which was very comfortable.We ordered three dishes and a glass of Chardonnay.Highlights: Everything!!- Wood Baked Butter Beans: so tasty and the perfect textures from the crunch of the bread crumbs to the Al dente bite of the beans. Such good flavor and tasted like chili if it was an entree and not a soup (if that makes any sense)- Flatbread of Roasted Mushrooms: this was so light and buttery. A tremendous amount of unique flavors paired together with the perfect textures . The buttery mushrooms paired so well with the gruyére cheese. Amazing.- Wood roasted cauliflower and hazelnut romesco: the simplicity plays a big part in the success of this side. The sauce is incredible. Exactly what you need paired with a simple cauliflower. Light and filling, amazing.- Warm peach Cobbler - the berries, granola, and ice cream come together so perfectly. The best way to end the meal with some hearty and flavorful bites to close out the meal.All in all, Nopa was outstanding. The service was very professional with great recommendations and tentative service. Can't wait to come back, try more, and experience the ever changing menu.,Place charges $35 for a single bottle cottage fee and refuses to open a second regardless of the group size. Food is decent but nothing you won't find at 90% of other SF eateries. Overall would avoid.My recommendation is to go somewhere with better vibe, service, and value.,I love this spot. They have amazing food and the service we had was just wonderful. The server was so knowledgable and enthusiastic. She was lovely  and I wish I knew her name so I could shout her out.The food was so tasty and delicious. They had so much on the menu that looked good but I could not afford much the night I went and had to settle but was super happy with how my food came out.Delicious !!!,Had an amazing experience here for our anniversary.The hostess and our waiter kept congratulating us and even gifted us with honey ice cream by the end of the night!The meal was great and the mushroom bread was BOMB. You won't regret that one!,Nopa is one of those spots that you are passing by and see always bustling and busy. Once I saw the interior and the dishes on envibe app I knew I finally have to come try it. It didn't dissapoint - food and service are on point!,"What did the rebellious British son say to his dad? """"No Pa!""""  Menu changes everyday but get a burger if they have one. I appreciated the welcoming nature of NOPA and will definitely be back for good food and great service. Sorry to headchef for not knowing you were the man while I was talking to you!",The experience at Nopa was pretty disappointing. We were seated at 6:15PM and our entrees weren't delivered until 7:30PM. That's one hour and 15 mins. That is so unacceptable. Likely the issue is that they overcrowd the restaurant compared to the size of the kitchen staff. We were seated pretty tightly between two other tables," even the waitress had trouble squeezing in to deliver our plates. I don't want to hear that """"sorry your food is late"," we have a lot of tickets to fill."""" Optimize your restaurant operations better so that the number of customers vs kitchen staff doesn't cause over an hour wait for the food. Unacceptable.",So disappointing! A favorite place just gone downhill. I ordered the burger and it was dry and dense. A burger? If you cant get that right...just saying, that is not a quality place, and for 26.00. The fried Chicken my partner had was also dry and the fries came out cold.,Hands down my favorite meal in the Bay Area so far. This is not the easiest restaurant to get into due to (understandable) popularity so make sure to book a reservation early on! I went with a group of 4 and we ordered a bunch of items to share for the table.The food:- Butter Lettuce salad: my god the butter lettuce was delicious and so sweet. Someone at our table said they could've easily had this as their own meal and I agree.- smoked trout: the COLOR! It looked beautiful when placed on our table. And it tasted as good as it looked. What a winner- broccoli: love me some roasted broccoli. And the pieces were fairly large and filling. The topping gave it an extra crunch which was nice.- Porkchop: this was oh so flavorful. And the Chinese broccoli on top tasted amazing as well. I'm not as huge of a fun of porkchops typically, but this one was very well done. Also, it's a fairly large dish so great when sharing- everyone got a bunch- Lasagna: we were all so surprised with this dish. It tasted both light and hearty at the same time. They add lemon zest to the ricotta cheese and it adds layers to the flavor. Definitely get.- Mushroom & cream pasta dish: this was my favorite dish. So creamy. So tasty. So perfect. And it was FILLED with mushrooms. Amazing.- Moroccan Fried Chicken: perfect for sharing as well. The fried chicken was juicy and had nice flavor, although I wish it was a tad spicier! They also provided some hot honey to eat with it and damn that's a great combo- Cookie: it was my birthday so they gave me a free order of cookies. We were all stuffed so didn't plan to eat dessert, but those cookies disappeared real quick. Nopa knows how to make an amazing salted chocolate cookie.The drinks: We got a few wines recommended by the sommelier. Overall, no complaints on them. Was a little pricy, but I was please to see that that wines we got weren't super marked up!I'll definitely be back. The meal isn't cheap (~$100+ after tax/tip between the food and wine), but definitely worth the splurge every once in a while!,Brought my boyfriend here on a quick weekend trip to San Francisco. Food & beverage was good as always but prices are very high.Service was lacking compared to the last time I was here, which was disappointing. We were (in my opion) a fairly easy table, as we knew exactly everything we wanted in the first round of her stopping by the table but she checked on us maybe once more throughout the evening and seemed a bit scattered all around - could be because she had too many tables, I'm not sure. Overall, a good experience.,I have eaten at Nopa twice. I recommend it. I had the cheeseburger, both times. That was delicious, and, of course as it always is, regrettable. That apparently is their most famous menu offering. It deserves the praise.Other than that, I'd only add that Nopa is a loud, festive place. There is a Chinese word, re nao," which an internet translation says is the equivalent of """"bustling with noise and excitement."""" That describes Nopa. You have to be in the mood. A curmudgeon would not enjoy it", especially since they also have shared tables. You should go if you want to have a good time in the company of others, possibly strangers; you should avoid it if you want a quiet, intimate spot.,Came here with a group of friends on a Monday night and fortunately, we were able to make a reservation a few days earlier though we had to sit in the outdoor seating area. Thankfully, the outdoor area was really well done as the space was enclosed and full of heaters allowing us to be warm in the classic SF cold nights.We ordered:* Duck Liver Mousse - 9/10: the mousse was light and fluffy, making it a perfect pairing with the crispy and meaty bread* Local King Salmon Crudo - 7/10: really nothing special, just a small charcuterie plate* Flatbread - 5/10: a bit generic tasting, probably can order this at any new-American restaurant* Fried Chicken - 8/10: very good fried chicken, but for 1/4th the price you can just go to Popeye's across the street* Bucatini - 10/10: pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was a perfect complement to our bread* Pork Chop - 10/10: star of the show, the pork chop was cooked perfectly making it meaty and juicy, the flavors were outstanding* French Fries - 8/10: just fries, but went really well with our drinks and wine* Strawberry Rhubarb - 7/10: a very fruity dessert that I enjoyed* Salted Chocolate Chip Cookies - 10/10: outstanding cookie, layered with a ton of chocolate and sprinkle of salt to balance the flavor* Dark Chocolate Fudge Cake - 4/10: a bit mediocre, you can find this style dessert at any sit-down restaurantMy group and I had a fantastic experience dining here as the food was scrumptious (for the most part), drinks strong and interesting, and the service was excellent. The staff constantly switched out our plates, wiped the table, and checked in on us without interrupting our conversations. The ambience of the place was lovely, though didn't really have a chance to take a look inside since we were outside.Next time, I would definitely get a bottle of wine recommended from the in-house sommelier since it seemed like he wasn't too keen on the bottle we picked.,It was a nice visit. The simple decor was trendy and cute. Wish I could have sat outside but it was too chilly. The waitress wasn't very helpful with picking items, but she provided good enough service, especially for how busy it was. The food was so good. I forgot a photo of the Flatbread, but that was really good.  Nothing, I mean nothing, compares to the moroccon chicken. The lasagna was surprisingly good to me. I wasn't a big fan of the bucatini, but it wasn't bad. The next table over ate all of theres. I would definitely visit again.,My brother and I were in attendance here about a month ago (in between Phish shows...)We had a 7-pm rezzy, had phenomenal service from Celisse.Everything from start to finish was a smash #1 hit.  The drink, the apps, the main course...  We left happy, and full...Some highlights:lamb meatballs - yummycountry pork chop - still moist and deliciousservice - exceptionalEager to return..,I don't often give five stars to American restaurants as it tends to be a fairly straight forward menu offering that doesn't really WOW you.But Nope definitely changed my assumption.Atmosphere:Just perfectly San Francisco. You feel at home, and you also feel this sense of community after stepping into this beautiful restaurant. The chefs are just ahead of you as you enter, and the hustle and bustle of San Francisco is just in the air.Food:Unbelievable. Impeccable. Delicious. While the menu wasn't extraordinary in that sense of the word, the execution was perfection. And isn't that what makes a restaurant amazing? I find simplicity lacking in a lot of high end restaurants. Too often the higher the price, the more restaurants feel the impulse to overcompensate by introducing too many flavors while underpinning the execution.Staff:Nothing to add other than they were extremely knowledgeable about their menu and the seasons. I can't enough great things about the wait staff here.Would I go back? Without a heartbeat. What an amazing restaurant for us San Franciscans,Just gotta shout out for the Melon Granita, Fig Leaf Ice Cream, Tapioca Pudding, and Coconut Streusel dessert. It's hard to describe, but it's one of the best, most interesting desserts I've ever had. Made me thankful to be alive; almost brought tears to my eyes....This dessert is perfection. It comes in a chilled bowl to make sure the icee doesn't melt. The light sweetness of the granita dances with the creaminess of the fig leaf ice cream, roundness and sweetness of the tapioca, and salty, crunchiness of the coconut streusel. It's really fun to eat, too. And one of the crazy features of this dessert -- the fresh melon rounds act as a palate cleanser so that the dish can be enjoyed maximally the full way through. Hats off to Nopa's dessert chef. Such a good dessert program!!,My sister and I were very excited to try this place. To start I had a wonderful martini and a pretty tasty corn salad that came with an outstanding creamy something (maybe the basil creme fraiche?), though it was very small. Then there was a very long wait before our entrees arrived. My sister had the House Smoked Brisket and it was kinda dry and hard- and not tasty. She sent it back for a burger right away and they were very kind about it. My Pappardelle, Nine Hour Bolognese and Summer Squash was just boring, but not bad enough to return. I just picked at it and my sister said she'd split her burger with me when it arrived. One of the wait staff saw that I'd only taken a couple bites of the pasta and took it off the bill without me even asking, which was very nice of them. It was a passable burger, much better than our original entrees, but nothing special.The service was wonderful and the place had great ambiance and a fun, hip feeling. I might try it again if someone invites me. Maybe it was just a bad night? But it was a pretty big let down after all the recommendations, so I wouldn't invite someone again myself!,Nopa exceeded my expectations!AMBIANCE: I thought the ambiance was great. The restaurant has high ceilings and an open kitchen at the back, so it feels really airy and modern inside.RESERVATION: We got a reservation two weeks in advance. I logged on around 9 AM and got a reservation for 4 people at 8 PM. When we arrived at the restaurant, we did have to wait outside for 20 minutes or so, and we got seated at 8:30 PM. It didn't bother me since this has happens to me frequently in SF, but it is something to consider. DRINKS: Prior to coming to the restaurant, we called and inquired about corkage. They have a 1 bottle limit per table, and the corkage fee is $50!!!!! I thought $50 was very steep... but their tactic worked on us, and we didn't bring our own bottle of wine. Half of our group got a bottle of wine (they are some more reasonably priced red wines on the menu, $40-$60 range). I had the For the Bees cocktail first. I also had the Purple Rain Dance. Both cocktails were excellent. FOOD: We loved everything that we got.- BRUSSEL SPROUTS: super crispy with a lemon-y sauce on top. If you like brussels, these are wonderful and you should definitely get them- PADRON AND SHISHITO PEPPERS: also very good. The padron peppers were SPICY, and they blend in with the shishito peppers well.. be warned- EGGPLANT PARMESAN: I had seen on a couple of other Yelp reviews where people spoke really highly of this. It was definitely good, but it didn't live up to the hype for me.- ROASTED COD: THE HIGHLIGHT!! The cod is super buttery and flaky melts in your mouth. It came with broccolini and mashed potatoes," which had some type of lemon caper sauce on them. It was amazing. I would come back to the restaurant just for this cod. Two of the friends I was with also got the pork chop and vegetable tagine. They both really enjoyed their dishes.Overall - was the food super inventive or creative? No. The food is very """"normal"""" California cuisine. However", their execution is impeccable. They do all of their dishes extremely well. This is a great date night restaurant that you don't have to make reservations 2 months in advance to go to.,The food is good and presentation is very nice, but there was nothing exceptional about the menu items to warrant the rather high prices. In other words, there isn't anything being offered here that you wouldn't be able find in any other gastropub. The service is excellent though and their outside dining parklet is done very well.We were happy with our food and desserts and would say if you happen to be in the neighborhood and are able to find parking, stop by for a drink and food but don't make a special trip.,I normally don't like pork chops because they have a strong scent to it, but this one was amazing! It was tender and so flavorful. All the other dishes were very fresh and delicious as well. Our server was so friendly and she managed to convince us to get dessert even though we were so full! I recommend eating family style so you get to try all kinds of dishes. It is a nice place for a date night but it gets pretty crowded as the night goes on so make sure to get a reservation or show up earlier during dinner.,Excellent excellent service!! We wanted certain bottles of wine and asked for the SOM and he did a fantastic job pairing 2 bottles for us. The food was superb, you can't go wrong with anything you choose. This is a must go to when in SF.,Can't-miss dining experience in SF. Fresh food, lively ambiance, and great service. You've got to have the tomato, crispy chickpea, and ricotta appetizer and the cornbread. My boyfriend had the fried chicken, which he loved, but heads up that the portion size is really big enough for two people. During COVID, they're requiring proof of vaccination (which I LOVE). Give that diners are squeezed into the space, I really appreciated this extra safety measure and felt totally safe dining inside. Lastly, make a reservation ahead of time! This is a poppin' spot. You'll be waiting a long time if you don't reserve.,I've heard so much about this restaurant and I understand why! Love the ambiance and how the menu changes seasonally. Definitely means I'll have to keep coming back to try more and more options. DRINKS: one thing you'll learn about this place, all the food/drink options have a twist/unique aspect to it. The drink menu had quite a few options for signature cocktails (mainly mezcal or gin based drinks)," but it seems like they were fairly accommodating if you didn't like one or the other. My friend for their take of a hot toddy that would normally come with mezcal but they offered to use regular tequila instead. I do think the drinks are very good and would definitely like to continue exploring this part of the menu! Roughly $15 per drink. FOOD: very well done """"American"""" food. I kind of understand why they call it new American because it's like what you would normally think as American food but taken up a notch. Delicious flavors and decent portion sizes. We ordered eggplant Parmesan", buttered beans, fried chicken, pork chop, side of fries and a side of shishito peppers. Everything was great! I do think the buttered beans (something they mentioned was always on the menu) had a little more flavor. Tasted kind of like kidney beans and breadcrumbs - like that's it. It was good though. The eggplant parm was DELICIOUS. We enjoyed the fried chicken as well, but the real star for that dish was the honey served with it. The consensus on the pork chop was that it was cooked very well, but could have also used a little more flavor. Both of our sides were good as well, but nothing super memorable. I do wish there had been more veg options (I didn't actually try the chicken or pork). I feel like it was hard to tell what was okay for me to eat vs not. Seemed like most options were salads. If they could enhance the menu by including a (V) that would be great. AMBIANCE: fun place to bring friends or a date! Very cool/casual ambiance in a nicer area of SF. The inside seems a little smaller, but they've really turned the outside dining area into a cute spot. There are heaters that are very warm so you kind of feel like you're inside. SERVICE: 10/10. Everyone was so nice and helpful. The service was quite timely and super respectful. COST: expect to drop some cash here. The main dishes are minimum $20 and are not big enough to share. You'll probably want some sides as well. It's pricey so although I did like it, I wouldn't make it a regular spot. Regardless, I think it's worth checking out at least once.,Nopa is the quintessential Italian dining experience. Menu changes weekly if not daily. The spaghetti is so fresh and perfectly paired with a meaty red sauce.  Roasted Brussel sprouts bursted with flavor every bite, the pickled onion on top was a layer of bonus flavor!Dessert was a lemon macaroon coated in a lemon glaze topped with key lime sorbet and a strawberry citrus compote.. so incredibly delicious each forkful! Lavender lemon drop was something I wish I could have a pitcher of left at the table. It was the most refreshing beverage I have ever!No parking it is SF,I managed to snag a last minute reservation with some friends on a Saturday night, and we had such a great time! The food and experience were both fantastic and I would definitely come back again. Food: All the dishes were complex, creative, and delicious, but the real stars of the show were the duck and peach cobbler. The duck was spiced marvelously and paired perfectly with a wine off their wine list. The peach cobbler was delicious, and the sweet corn ice cream on top of it added a savory flavor to this otherwise sweet dessert. Service: The waitstaff were helpful and accommodating! They gave us great recommendations based on dietary restrictions our party had. Food arrived pretty quickly on a course-by-course basis as we requested. Vibe: We dined indoors on a Saturday night, which made for a lively dining experience. It was a great environment for socializing and dining with friends.,Fantastic service and food. Was pretty busy when we got there, but got seated immediately and our orders came out fast, fresh, and delicious. Biggest issue was figuring out what to order - everything sounded so good. For drinks, definitely go for the Educated Guess!,3.5 but rounding up. I still don't fully understand the hype! Came back because it's a friends favorite restaurant but still left underwhelmed. Drinks: cocktails were very sweet. Wine was goodFood: shared trout (4/5), Brussels sprouts (4/5), white beans (3/5), burger (2/5), pork chop (5/5). I would agree that the pork chop is probably the best I've had. Other than that everything else was ok.,From the drinks to appetizers to entrees and dessert every single delicious bite was amazing. The bruschetta is to dye for, the warm goat cheese, the pasta dish, the burger, and fried chicken all made the taste buds fly to heaven, we basically ordered everything and shared it. Absolutely delicious.,A great place for a late night fine dining experience. San Francisco typically shuts down around 9:00 pm. Where do the night owls, and the insomniacs, go to enjoy a late night fine dining experience? NOPA is a great solution to this mystery. Everything at this Divisadero street late night eatery lives up to its well deserved hype.,Variety of vegetarian options on the menu: 3/5Nopa is a great spot and it's clearly popular. Our seasonal vegetarian selection was OK in my opinion. The Moroccan vegetable tajin was underwhelming and the lasagna was definitely unique but not what we expected. We enjoyed the warm goat cheese, but I think we'll try the restaurant again when the dishes circulate.,Upscale restaurant great for a date or a nice dinner with friends. Smoked TroutDelicious light starter with crisp vegetables, Tzatziki, and crunchy Quinoa.  The texture and flavors in this dish were a great way to start the meal!PappardellePasta with bolognese sauce that was good, but not something we'd order again (because the rest of the menu looks so good)Duck LegThe star of this meal! The duck was extremely savory and fall off the bone tender. The dish game with risotto, morels, and broccoli -- all great. 10/10Chocolate MarquiseChocolate heaven -- light and airy with a refreshing cream and fruit flavor blast. The cocoa nibs around the side make for a great textural addition. The service was fantastic and overall we had a great experience.,This place is so fun to goout. You feel like you are in the action. Last time I was there Julia Roberts was eating next to me. The roast chicken is done beautifully and a huge portion. The sommelier is awesome and is the daughter of Erna Edelberry from Chateaux Surreau. She is so knowledgable and fun!,Nice location, atmosphere. I used Open table to cut through the Open Table app to cut through the wait and food even though I needed the lamb re-fired from rare to med-rare was great.The Moroccan spiced chicken is hard batter fried with a sweet chili dip. Perfect!The best part of the experience was the Peach, cucumber and rosted corn salad that had an whipped avocado sauce with it, sweet peach contrasting the lightly salted mini cucumber  was a good taste.. Dipping the biscuit in the avocado puree followed by the corn creates a whole another taste from just the same bowl.  Get this to start off your meal. It's a 5 star by itself; and 5 stars are hard to get from me.  Service was as expected, no issues or anything memorable.Moracan spiced chicken, my dish,Vodka & cranberry, Moscow mule (not in a tin cup) and 2 unmuttered Mohittos all for $210 incld 18%,Excellent place for good vibes - loved sitting outdoors here, nice and cosy with good music- great, consistent service Food was quite good, but didn't blow my socks off - salad, lovely and crisp. Liked the crunch and mixture of ingredients - butter beans, yum! Class, comfort fare - butternut squash lasagna, the bolognese was slightly too salty, but really enjoyed having the taste of butternut squash lightly present. - veggie tagine, hearty but underwhelming as a dish imo - panna cotta (really enjoyed the texture and taste) - chocolate chip cookies, really great with a little dab of yummy salt,one of my favorite restaurants in the city. the menu is constantly changing with lots of unique dishes. amazing drinks and great service.,Great ambience, awesome service. Loved the orange cream soda (very ugly color but tastes amazing). All of the egg dishes were solid, and the sweets were the perfect amount sweet. But the burger stole the show and is what I'll be getting next time I'm in town! Definitely worth sharing a custard French toast for the table (it is HUGE). Our waiter heard us talking when we came in and he snagged us the very last skillet cornbread of the day, which was one of the best dishes we tried. Overall, it's easy to see why this is considered one of the best brunch places in San Francisco!,I will give Nopa a 4. this time. It used to be better place. Even though it is still great place. Mojitos are not the same jaja. The squash soup is a 5.They lost our reservations but they took care well of the moment.Burger was ok and the fried chicken was good.They have seat outside, they are pet friendly, good service.,Stars for service, giant good, lack of stars for ridiculous price---way too expensive to spend close to $50 for fries, burger and a Shirley temple without refills imho.,Seriously not worth the hype nor the price. Idk what it's like for brunch, but for dinner, almost everything my friends and I tried here was mid, also service was really slow. (We sat down for our reservation at 6:30 and finished at 9. There was almost an hour wait between the time our appetizers came and the main course -- they just seem super understaffed.)Fried Brussel sprouts - way too much lemon, wish they added the lemon on the side bc the dish was too sour to be palatable. 2/5Chicory salad - nothing special. tastes like a premade caesar salad you can buy at any grocery store. 2/5Butter baked beans - pretty decent, beans are giant, pretty flavorful! 4/5French Fries - idk how you can mess up french fries but these were the worst fries i've ever had. they were crispy on the outside and dry on the inside. (think potato chips, but unsalted) you can get better fries at mcdonald's. 0/5Duck liver mousse - this was really good. very flavorful and balanced flavors. would come here again just for this dish. 6/5Lasagna - liked that there was a lot of crispy pieces on the lasagna, idk if it was anything special. but you can't go wrong ordering this. it's super solid. 5/5Fried chicken - Solid fried chicken. Wish they gave a little bit more honey though. 5/5Brisket - Smokeyness was nice but still really mid. Some parts extremely dry. 3/5,The cocktails are amazing! I wish the food had more vegetarian and vegan friendly options though.,Had a bunch of the menu to share, I think the best thing was the app we had of the smoked trout. The beet sauce was sublime and the smoked trout paired excellently with the salad. The lamb meatballs were decent, pork chop was well seasoned, and loved the richness of the bucatini with clams. Very busy so come with a reservation.,Milk Punch Review: Ay Bay Bay: gin, strawberry, clarified coconut milk, grappa, bay laurelThis was ok for me. Wasn't the flavor profile that I venture towards. My partner would enjoy much more. There was a medicinal taste to it that she loves. I appreciate the work involved in this.,I've heard a lot of mixed reviews about Nopa, but my experience there was absolutely fantastic. I thought the food was extremely well prepared, with interesting flavors and generous portions. The place is super busy and this reservation was booked three weeks out, but it was worth the wait.Dishes:Smoked trout salad with beet hummus, soft egg, and house bread - this dish was so interesting. The beet hummus was incredibly sweet and complimented the citrus and the smoked flavor of trout, which was great. The bread was really good too, although the crust was a bit burnt which is a pet peeve of mine.Country pork chop with sauerkraut and spiced apples - possibly the best pork chop I've ever had. It was unbelievably tender and juicy, which is rare for a pork chop, but also had a perfect grilled char on it. The sauerkraut and apples paired nicely with the juicy cut.Moroccan spiced fried chicken with spicy honey sauce - so crunchy and so tender! And the spicy honey sauce to top it off was too good, we got two more servings of it because we couldn't get enoughCitrus pavlova - nice and refreshing with clean citrus flavors and a light balanced cream. Really nice way to cap off the meal and sort of a palette cleanser.Mandarin pana cotta - similarly refreshing to the pavlova, this wasn't too sweet but had fantastic citrus flavors.Overall - 10/10. I'll be back here with more friends soon! It definitely lived up to the hype.,Sadly, another disappointment.Everyone goes here because it's the only upscale resto on Divis that's big enough to walk in and sit at the bar. Meaning it's way more crowded than it should be for the quality.The food is pretty okay. Not what I'd consider fine dining, but akin to what's available in the area. Maybe it's popular because the bartenders drizzle juice down the bar spoon. Oooh. Party tricks.I had the seasonal flatbread of mushrooms," shishito peppers and gruyere. Shishitos we're not necessarily.And two Grey Goose martinis.What I don't appreciate - and what dropped it from a generous 4 stars to a """"dang!"""" 3 stars is the mysterious $6.00 item on the bill.When I asked this is the response I got:Bartender 1: that's the standard upcharge for an extra pourMe: What?Bartender 1: yesI asked again...Bartender 2: yes the upcharge for an extra pour - it's 1.5 pour.Me: I've never been charged extra money for a martini.Bartender 2: I've been tending for 10 years and this is considered an extra pour.Me: I've been drinking for 20 years and I've never been upcharged for a martini.He took it off the bill.",NOPA is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. Every time we go, the service is absolutely fantastic. They clearly know their menu well and are always able to recommend great wine pairings. The food is consistently delicious. They use what's in season and have a wide variety of dishes to fit both omnivores and herbivores. My favorite by far, however, is when they have salmon on their menu; it is perfectly done. The only down side is that a reservation can be tricky to get, so you just need to plan ahead! Thanks, NOPA, for being a SF staple and exemplar for all these years!,Food - pretty good, but many other restaurants in the area serve at least as good. We had pasta and salad. My pasta was slightly overcooked and oversauced, my wife's looked much better. NOTE I AM DEFINITELY A SUPER TASTER just kidding, I'm sure the chefs here know better than me.Ambience - great, albeit they cram too many tables inside still. The wait staff regularly bump into folks.Price - $$$, two person dinner with a few drinks was ~$250.Service - All over the place. We had constant miscommunications, awkward long delays, and generally we had to get the wait staff's attention consistently rather than being checked on.. This put our rather modest dinner (two people, two drinks, a salad, and two entrees) at two+ hours.In the end, I don't really know how to feel. Definitely not worth the price, and for a date night it ended up being a dud. I think if I went with a larger group (maybe 4-6 folks) where sharing multiple dishes, and if their wait staff improved attentiveness then I might reconsider.,I went to Nopa two nights in a row and had an amazing time. The steak and chilled red wine were absolutely delicious.Both times we were taken care off by Anna and Truce. They were spectacular - so kind, welcoming and made many accommodations for our large (and un-expected) party of ten the first night. Looking forward to going back soon.,I had walked past NoPa a number of times, and it is always super busy. Finally decided to make a reservation a month in advance... and it was definitely worth it. The warm goat cheese starter was absolutely fantastic. Next, perfectly cooked fried chicken and pork chop for the mains. Would definitely go back and have to try the burger that looked so good on other tables.,Came here for our anniversary. So glad we came. Everything was so fresh and the service is excellent!!Antonio was our server and he was very attentive.,Cute interior with friendly bar service - even during busy nights! Fries were solid and drinks were beautifully presented. We had only a quick stop but I'm already looking forward to coming back to try the full menu soon!,We had a fabulous time at Nopa. The staff was so friendly from start to finish - from the host, to our server, to bussers, and food runners. We sat outside and even though it was a chilly SF night, there was plenty of warmth coming from their outdoor heaters. We ordered a bottle of wine that paired perfectly with everything we ordered. We got two appetizers and two entrees for 3 people which was the perfect amount of food. The smoked trout came with grapefruit, beets, and a delicious creamy sauce. Next, we had the mushroom toast which was my favorite. The bread was thick, moist, and crunchy. It was a perfect blend of flavors with the mushrooms, balsamic glaze, and cheese. Not too mushroomy - just right.The vegetable tagine was light and flavorful and paired nicely with the fried chicken. The fried chicken came with a delicious spicy honey which accented the dish perfectly. We had a lovely time at Nopa!,Very good meal, but I'd say not worth all the hype and a bit overpriced. The bolognese was good but not great, same for the eggplant parm. The pork chop was delicious, and had some of a lamb polenta appetizer that was also really good! The wine was also really good, but pricey. Also had a pizza appetizer which was fine. Overall probably just had too high of expectations going in.,Great food and the sweetest waiter. He was there with a smile and upbeat vibe plus great enthusiasm for the excellent food. We sat outside in the cool evening but were very comfortable. Just a lovely meal and experience.,We stopped by for a quick drink at the bar and had such a great experience.The bartenders were so attentive and nice when we were there. The ambiance is lively, and the decor is stunning.We also had some of the best fries I've ever had in my life here. :),Came here for a work dinner in a group of eight on a Thursday night. Place was totally packed. We were seated at a communal table at the windows of the entrance to the restaurant, and our event coordinator worked with the restaurant to build us a multi-dish, three-course menu.To start, we had the warm marinated olives, flatbread with Tasso ham, Asian pear, gruyère, and honey mustard, and a little gems salad with Bartlett pears, candied pecans, and feta. I don't like olives so I can't speak for those, but they came served with a delicious, rustic bread that seemed to be house-baked and was crusty on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. The flatbread was as pretty as it was delicious; the ham was just the right amount of salty and the pear and cheese created a nice mix of sweet and savory. Loved the salad and especially the pecans, which tasted more toasty than candied (a good thing).For the entrees we had Moroccan spiced fried chicken and chili honey, pork chops with orange glazed sweet potatoes," """"autumn greens", and hazelnuts, roasted vegetable tagine with almonds and lemon yogurt, and grilled broccoli with lemon and breadcrumbs. Everything was delicious. The pork chop was juicy and tender and getting a bite of the vegetables with each bite of meat was so good. Definitely recommend trying the fried chicken here, because the spices in the batter combined with the chili honey is fantastic. Loved the brightness of the broccoli. The tagine was the only dish that was just alright, but wasn't at all bad. I think just compared to the rest of the food it was a bit boring, but the sauce was great and since we had bread leftover I was able to scoop some up with it. The vegetables were also cooked well and didn't get mushy.Dessert was an apple ginger hazelnut crisp with whipped crème fraîche and spiced pear ice cream. Everything I love about fall deserts. Absolutely delicious.I washed everything down with a passion fruit cooler, which was the only non-alcoholic drink on the menu along with a number of cocktails and wines. Every drink was presented beautifully, as was the food. Attention to detail is valued here and it shows in everything, from the decor to the presentation of the food to the food itself and the wait staff, who were all very nice and came around regularly to check in on us despite how busy the restaurant was that night.Since this was a pre-planned work event I can't speak to the pricing of our meal, but peeking at the menu online, Nopa is a bit pricey. This is a treat yourself type of meal and had to have been particularly expensive given all of the food and alcohol for eight people. But if you're looking for a nice place to splurge on a meal for a celebration or just because, Nopa would be a very nice place to go.,Nopa will always be one of my stops whenever I go to SF. The menu changes, but the food is always killer. The pork chop is the best I've ever had - never knew a chop could be that tender. They make the simplest ingredients shine and form explosions in your mouth,This may be an unpopular opinion but overall I don't think NOPA lived up to the hype. It was good, really good in pockets but the entrees fell flat which is too critical to be as wowed as people are about NOPA. Ordered the butter beans, avocado beet salad, mushroom spinach lasagna and the veggie tagine.The apps were the real standouts. The beans and beet salad were really flavorful, good portions and knocked it out of the park. I made sure to clean the plates and lick the spoons after. Wish I ordered more of these instead of entrees.The mushroom spinach lasagna and the veggie tagine were shared. Both were goooood but not great and definitely not on par to the apps. Drinks were good, ordered a mezcal drink and asked to make it spicy which they obliged. Waiter service was exceptional! They're very nice, friendly and super polite.,I have been here a couple of times and each time I am reminded of why it's my chef friends' all time favorite San Francisco restaurant. First off, the service. They have somehow created a lively and classy atmosphere while also making you feel right at home. I think the owners are closely involved at front and back of house daily so I am sure that has a lot to do with it, but we always end up chatting with strangers about the delightful food and having multiple staff check in on us to chat, I am blown away at the hospitality. But we all know that's just the beginning at Nopa. Years ago, I first tried the warm goat cheese appetizer and I have thought about it many times since. It's truly phenomenal. Next I've tried the beans. The pork. The fried chicken- oh my goodness so good! The burger? In my experience, this burger is the best in San Francisco. Without a doubt. All of it is delicious and is consistent every time. I will never stop eating at or recommending Nopa. They also have a phenomenal wine selection! Lastly, the atmosphere. Nopa has a very chic and stylish indoor atmosphere that makes you feel like you're really on a night out but they somehow were able to emulate this same feeling in their outdoor parklet that originated during the pandemic, I think. Hats off to Nopa!,You can spruce up or go easygoing, you'll fit in any case. For simply my better half and I got two starters, two courses, three beverages each," and two pastries.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pearl,"Came here with some friends and it lived up to the hype. I highly recommend making a reservation because it is very popular. There is eating inside and outside of the restaurant. My friends and I shared pastas and the caesar salad. The caesar salad is probably the best I've ever had. Can't wait to take others here! Beautiful decor and ambiance.,A pretty unique place for italian food and cocktails (too bad I was in my dry January that day)The food came fast and delicious. The handkerchief pasta was really good, and the scallops were amazing. I am taking one star off because the other dishes that night was too salty. The guava sorbet came to rescue.see for yourself:youtu.be/8yxLh7ujEOw?t=1…,A neighborhood gem of a pearl it is! Was here on a Tuesday night with a reservation, was seated promptly at the bar for 2 at an earlier time. Service was friendly. We had the tuna crudo to start. Finely diced to accommodate the presence of  a starter, the ingredients were fresh and tuna firm but with a bite and not a fatty cut. Lightly paired with a freshening aioli, this appetizer exuded life and charm for an entree ahead. I had the duck leg confit - though crispy with adequate seasoning to accompany the texture of the meat, the mustard and pickled cabbage proved too strong and acidic to bear as the meal went on. A slight addition with a tone of sweetness would have been appreciated. Perhaps some elements of a puree or more neutral flavors to balance. The huckleberry compote just added unnecessarily so to the overpowering sour overtone of these preparations to the side which masked the flavors of the duck.The dessert was the absolute star! Bright, bold and unabashedly fragrant with notes of vanilla and apple, this was one of the best desserts I have had in a while. The spiced caramel drizzle was aptly infused with dashes of cinnamon and a toasted aroma, reservedly bittersweet. The ice cream was luxe to the tongue, milky, buttery smooth. The tart crusted and jeweled with apples executes a fantastic touch of pastry goodness.A cozy, candlelit environment with a the ambience of a neighborhood bistro right in the heart of San Francisco. Come visit for yourself!3.75/5,The cutest little restaurant for a cozy hangout or date night! While there is indoor and outdoor seating, I'd recommend getting a reservation beforehand since it gets quite busy and parking can be hard to come by.The menu changes by seasons so some items may be switched around depending on when you go-- but I highly recommend any of the pastas.For drinks, we ordered the morning glory: 4/5 --sweet, fruity, refreshing!handkerchief pasta: 5/5 -- creamy, hearty pasta with plenty of cheese. The flavor profile was very balanced, not too salty or sickeningly heavyclam spaghetti: 5/5 -- my absolute favorite pasta dish!!! The sauce was heavenly; a bit of umami from the clams, sweetness from wine and butter, this pasta was truly the star of the show. I had to stop myself from ordering another one! Overall, I really like the ambiance of this restaurant and would recommend to anyone in the area who is looking for a cute, homey dining experience,Came here for dinner on a Sunday and it was still pretty packed! Our server was super sweet and recommended a couple of their favorites. We ended up getting the steak tartare, the roasted cauliflower, and the sticky chocolate torte. The sauce that the cauliflower sits on was so good, it was super rich and nutty with a slight chili oil flavor. The steak tartare was also pretty good! I would def come here for small groups cause all their dishes are great for sharing!,Best date spot since it's cozy with so much warmth and low lighting. Definitely will be coming back again.Service 5/5 our server came around multiple times to make sure we were enjoying our meal and to make sure our glasses were always filled. She was really kind too! Squid ink bucatini 5/5Hands down the best thing we had. The Calabrian gives it the perfect kick and the tuna was perfect for the flavors of the noodles.Prawns 5/5Second best dish since it has a lime flavor with a chili kick to it too. I think they may have used bird eye chilis. Oysters 5/5Pork chop 2/5Very underwhelming compared to everything else and didn't really have a flavor but more of just straight up meat alone. Steak 3/5Wouldn't get again but the medium rare steak was good. They were precut into five thick slices and dint have too much flavor to it too.CauliflowerWe had broccoli instead I think but it was the same toppings. Despite it being broccoli, it tasted good still,An excellent meal with complex well-composed dishes that showed both solid execution and innovation.The cauliflower app is a must. So much going on there with the mole, almost, and sweet raisins. It's just a new set of flavors and textures to explore.The popular handkerchief pasta didn't disappoint. The pasta was perfectly fresh and chewy. The sauce was a nice balance of lightness and body.The torte I thought was just OK. It didn't have that intensity of flavor that was achieved in the savory dishes I had.,This meal did not miss. Went here on a Friday with friends and scored a 5:30pm indoor reservation day of, luckily. The inside is very cute and airy, sort of like a European cafe. Service was lovely and prompt as well. We decided to do family style and loved it. To start, we got the acme bread - warm soft with a lovely crust, oysters - fresh with unique and delightful flavors on top, and tartare - a generous portion with excellent contrasting flavor from the pickled onions and frisée. To share for the mains, we got the sole, steak, spaghetti, and handkerchief pasta. Everything was perfect. I really liked how the seafood spaghetti had a good flavor and nice coating of sauce, usually I find that seafood pasta has a more watery sauce that doesn't stick as well, but this one was great! The handkerchief pasta was delicious and rich, some of my friends mentioned it reminded them (nostalgically) of ""the best hamburger helper"" and were raving about how homey it tasted. I thought it was delicious too. The fish was delicious and well-cooked and the steak had a wonderful almost molé-like sauce that my friends also loved. As for drinks, we had cocktails and wine. I enjoyed all of the cocktails I was able to try (3 of them). All around, a solid spot with not a single thing on the menu I didn't like.,Whether it's a date night, dinner with parents, or a casual weeknight meal... Pearl 6101 has never disappointed. It's where I introduced my girlfriend to my parents.,Sometimes I feel my rating criteria has been skewed, adding a layer of emotion and understanding in forming my opinion.  Let's face it, it's a lot more difficult to enjoy that perfect meal these days.  Food, service, ambiance, and intangibles used to be the criteria.  These days, situation is a factor.My friend invited me to dinner here on an early Sunday September evening.  We were third in line after finding street parking up the block and arriving ten minutes early.  We were seated at one of the 23rd Ave tables and quickly offered water and menus.  After a quick study, we gave our waiter our order.  For my drink, I asked for something fruity in ordering the ""not so cocktail"", the one with bitter apertivo, grapefruit, and citrus n.a. spirit (yelp.com/user_local_phot…); it was tasty, refreshing, and visually attractive with the grapefruit rind spiralling in the tall glass.  For food, my friend and I discussed what dishes we were considering and she hatched a great plan.  We started by sharing an entree  as an appetizer, the seared scallops (yelp.com/user_local_phot…), that came with corn, spaetzle, braised onions, and espelette; this was delicious as we both considered ordering this for our entree.  The smoky scallop flavor meshed well with the sweet corn niblets, slightly tangy onions, and rich spaetzle.  For my main, I had the pork chop (yelp.com/user_local_phot…), garnished with barlotti beans, Jimmy Nardello peppers, Romano beans, and black garlic; the pork was cooked a medium well which was fine, given the variety of ingredients and boldness of the flavors in this dish.  I was going back and forth with different combinations of items to fork in pairing with the pork and they all worked, from the tang and spice of the peppers, the crunchiness and clean flavors from the romano beans, to the richness of the barlotti beans, it worked well.  The black garlic also left no hint of blandness in any bite.  For dessert, we shared two items with the sticky chocolate torte (yelp.com/user_local_phot…), which came with raspberries mascarpone, and candied hazelnut and the melon sorbet (yelp.com/user_local_phot…), dressed with basil oil and sea salt.  The torte was brownie-like in being a thick and heavy chocolate bar, lightened by the mascarpone and the tartness from the raspberries.  The hazelnut gave it a crunch factor.  The sorbet was honey dew flavor this evening, being light but one-note in flavor.  The only side note is that my gracious host commented that her dish (sole) was heavy on the salt. Service was prompt and efficient though water glasses need not be refilled since we were given a carafe of ice water.  They did refill that once or twice when it ran low.  A variety of staff members came and went in clearing our table and bringing dishes out.  In fact, a kitchen staff (one of the chefs, I believe) brought out dessert out.  It definitely has a neighborhood casual food as couples and families comprised the outdoor dining crowd.  I didn't walk inside but, waiting for my friend who needed to go in, I noticed the noise level is definitely higher inside.  I would rate this a four plus star experience but bumping it up for my thoughtful host's judgment in bringing me to a relatively new dine-in experience since this has been rare since 2020 for an enjoyable meal.,Food: 3/5Service: 4/5Ambiance: 4/5Overall: The food was standard fare in my opinion.Food:Seared Tuna Crudo - 3/5 - Pretty standard fare in terms of taste.  The fish tasted fresh.Stead Tartare - 3/5 - Similar to the tuna the taste was standard fare.Duck Leg - 3.5 - This was a little different with the crispiness which was a nicer touch.  This did dry out the duck a little bit though.  Spiced Pear Upside Down Cake - 3/5 - I really couldn't taste the pear that much.  The good thing is that the cake was moist.Chocolate Creme Caramel - 3/5 - A very rich and dense chocolate creme for sure.  A nice take on the standard creme caramel and by far more decadent.Service: 4/5 - Very friendly and attentive staff.Ambiance: 4/5 - A cute ambiance inside along with good outdoor seating.,Need to make a reservation early. Great service and atmosphere.  Relaxing, great pasta dishes.,The menu already sounded appealing, but amazingly enough, the food tasted even better than expected. Nothing we ordered was disappointing. For two, we had Acme bread and butter (I can never say no to Acme) and split the cauliflower appetizer. I had the crab gemelli for my main. We also shared the pear upside down cake for dessert. Every bite of food was delicious. I loved the crab gemelli- the pasta was cooked perfectly; the sauce was creamy but not heavy; there was a generous amount of sweet crab meat; and the herbs, thin slices of chilis, and breadcrumbs kept the dish interesting and had me going back for more. The spiced pear upside down cake with ginger ice cream was decadent. I loved the thick slice of cake drizzled with caramel sauce. The spices and the candied ginger made the dessert so comforting and warming. For me, the ginger ice cream didn't taste strongly of ginger. It actually leaned into savory notes, which was perfect for cutting the sweetness of the dessert.But the best bite of the night (and for me, probably of the year!) was the cauliflower. It just had my tastebuds singing! The herbaceousness from the chermoula, creaminess from the black hummus, crunch from the almonds, and the sweetness of the raisins. Chef's kisses.,Second time here since 3 years ago and it was just as good as I remembered! We got the cauliflower appetizer which was so unique and delicious. We couldn't choose just 2 pastas between the two of us so decided to get all 3 - handkerchief pasta, squid ink bucatini and radiatori. All 3 were amazing but I'm partial to the handkerchief pasta - so fresh and with just the right amount of kick. The squid ink bucatini was crunchier and spicier than the ones I've tried from other places and it was quite good. The radiatori was my husband's favorite. All in all a very good evening spent, and the service was excellent!,We decided to dine at this lovely restaurant after a fun beach outing on my husband's birthday. Delicious &  Creative menu options with seasonal items as well! Portion sizes were great to share & flavors were unique and on point! When we got here, the server told us that we had the table for only one hour because we made reservations on the same day. Anyway, we agreed and started placing our order. Cocktails were delicious & well presented! We could easily have three rounds of them! For appetizers we ordered the Roasted Cauliflower in Black Tahini Humus, topped with almond and raisins. THE BEST!! Even our kids LOVED it, who do not really care for Cauliflower otherwise!For mains we tried their Ricotta Cavatelli!! Yum!We were full but always have space for dessert! So, we ordered their Blueberry Crostana with Formage Blanc Lavender Ice Cream. SOOO GOOD! And the presentation was BOMB!The kids had the Banana Coconut Cream Pudding topped with Pecan Streusel! It was amazing! Next time we're here, we will definately try their Duck Leg Confit with Cous Cous!Roadside parking.Advance reservations recommended.Heated Patio dinning available although it still gets chilly.,I'm just an occasional visitor to San Francisco, but this is the place I most look forward to dining.  Every time.  The squid ink spaghetti may be in my Top 10 entrees I've ever tasted.  But also the scallops are perfection.  And the chocolate crème caramel is beyond description.  Love this place.,I love that a Cal-Ital restaurant is located just a short walking distance from my home. This is a fantastic restaurant with excellent food, great service, and a cozy, warm and trendy feel. I've come here several times over the years, and more recently during the pandemic. Inside dining is charming, but the outside is equally charming, and equally warm too. They have a fabulous parklet, and have made good use of their space on the sidewalk, without feeling cramped. Service is great here too. They are pretty friendly here.The food here is solid. Between my husband and I, we ordered most recently the steak tartare, Roasted Delicata Squash, Handkerchief, Spaghetti, and Ricotta Cavatelli. All dishes were fantastic. I would say the standout dishes were the Steak Tartare, Handkerchief white bolognese, and the Ricotta Cavatelli. The Spaghetti with clams got a little boring to eat after a few bites, as well as the delicata squash, although they were well executed. Things I think they could improve on is changing the menu. I've been here about 4 times since May 2021, and the menu has virtually stayed the same, cocktails included. That being said, it makes me not want to come on a regular basis, which is quite a bummer. I guess I will revisit again sometime in the summer.,My girlfriend and I love coming here for some delicious food. We always end up getting the handkerchief pasta and an entree.  The ACME bread is a definite must as well. It is crunchy/crispy on the outside and warm on the inside and served with a side of butter. The most notable entree that I have had so far was the swordfish. Next on my list to try is the hanger steak. All of there cocktails are delicious and they have a good variety to suit your mood.,Want an incredible place just a few blocks away. Came to Pearl for a celebratory dinner and this place was perfect. The service was excellent and we were well advised on our meal and wine selection. When we were told the pasta was made in house I was sold on a pasta dish. We end up sharing the Radiatori and Grilled Hanger Steak. Both were amazing! The pasta had a wonderful balance of flavors and the added mint was a perfect touch. The Hanger Steak had a Chile Rojo sauce I wish I could buy in a jar to take home.Wine wise we went with Trediberri which I loved!! Don't be afraid to ask for recommendations wine wise. The list is long lol Looking forward to returning and to trying more dishes. Highly recommend!,A busy little place with ample outdoor seating on California st, this a delightful experience you must not miss! The food is great, the cauliflower starter has the best sauce and the nuts for dressing add to the flavor and makes want you for more! The peppers are not for people you can't take spice, it was warm and spicy! The missing one star was for the veggie pasta, though the veggies were really fresh and well made, just a butter sauce weakened the pasta a little. A pesto sauce would have nailed it. The dessert was befitting finale to our meal. Loved it. We would definitely go back again and enjoy this beautiful restaurant with a great menu and wonderful staff. Street parking can get tricky but you should be able to find with some hunting.,What can I say about perfection... nothing because a it's perfect! The staff are friendly and kind! Let's not forget about the cute dog outside the restaurant at the host stand! The food... was stunning!!! The taste was out of this world! Thank you for being amazing!,Their pastas are SO GOOD. I really liked their spaghetti pasta and their handkerchief pasta. The spaghetti pasta was so flavorful and the seafood was super fresh. I also liked how creamy the handkerchief pasta cream was, and the pasta itself was so perfectly thin and was a really elegant take on bowtie pasta. We also tried their shishito peppers which were tasty as well! The steak tartare is also a great appetizer to whet your appetite.We also ordered the grilled hangar steak which was pretty good as well, but definitely doesn't compare to how good their pastas are.We also ordered all of the desserts on the dessert menu...and ALL of them are worth trying! Lemon Verbena Panna Cotta, the Apricot Upside Down Cake and the Sticky Chocolate Torte were all delicious.We also tried their Melon Sorbet - this has basil oil which had added a really refreshing taste (and the sorbet is already refreshing!) and I was really surprised at how well the flavours went together.If I lived closer I wouldn't feel the need to have ordered four desserts but my friend reallllly wanted to so why not?? Definitely check out this place for cute date night vibes too, the interior is so cute!,Review #200, and I'm thrilled to write this one. Restaurants like Pearl 6101 is what makes San Francisco really special. It's a cute neighborhood corner bistro that has a laid-back yet chic vibe with extremely well-executed food and cocktails. A group of 4 of us visited on a bright and breezy Sunday spring evening, and sat outside near some heat lamps. Some folks are going maskless these days, but our household continues to mask up and opt for outdoor dining when we can. Parking can be a bit tricky in this neighborhood, so plan on arriving about 5-10 minutes early to scope out a nearby space. Here's what we ordered along with several tasty cocktails:-Ahi crudo-Steak tartare-Roasted broccolini (this was so good that we ordered another one)-Roasted cauliflower-Green garlic rigatoni-Seared scallops-Grilled hangar steak-Glazed crispy pork belly-Chocolate almond tartWe loved everything. Joyfully ate every delicious morsel. Every dish had beautiful bright flavors and fresh, crunchy elements that were well-balanced and thoughtful.Service was friendly, fun, and efficient.  Well done, Pearl 6101!  You guys are a truly a gem!,Drove by this place a couple months ago and was charmed by the outdoor seating, adorned with twinkle lights, tucked on a neighborhood corner. Told my partner a date night was in order. We had that night tonight and while the overall experience was good, we were both pretty underwhelmed by the food. It was all really quite heavy (too fatty) and not as much flavor nuance as I would expect from a place with such high ratings. I felt like I needed a palate cleansing sorbet between entries to help balance out the weight of each dish. My favorite thing was the yogurt pana cotta with chamomile and strawberry preserve. I wouldn't say I didn't like anything, it just wasn't a well balanced meal especially for paying nearly $200 for only 2 people.,This a is a great neighborhood staple.  Can be a little salty but ingredients are fresh and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.,Came here Friday evening with reservations. Very quaint atmosphere and friendly service. The roasted cauliflower was a nice surprise. The black tahini sauce had a citrus flavor which complimented the veggies. We also ordered the pork chop which was nicely grilled to perfection. The red peppers added a pop of spice. I was pleasantly surprised with their signature handkerchief pasta with white sauce bolognese which has bits of veal and pork and it was not heavy or rich. Definitely worth trying. The sorbet was really refreshing and a perfect dessert to finish our meal.  We want to return to try other items on the menu since it listed all our favorites.,I didn't know what to expect here because I let someone else pick a restaurant for dinner. I was very pleasantly surprised by the food. We got the acme bread & butter, halibut crudo, roasted cauliflower and oysters to start. The bread had great texture; the exterior had the perfect crunch. The halibut was a vessel for all the toppings and FLAVOR! the marcona almonds on top were a great touch as well. I saw reviews that the roasted cauliflower is a must order and everyone was right. The sauce was Smokey, and the cauliflower still had a crunch without tasting raw. For my entree I ordered the tuna spaghetti. The pasta had the perfect texture and was garlicky and a had a kick to it. The bread crumbs on top were a great touch. My dessert was the apricot sorbet with urfa honey and crushed pistachios. There was some spicy afternoon, not sure what it was but it was interesting.For sure would come back! I had dinner on Saturday at 5pm and it was full so make sure to make a reservation!,One if the best experiences in restaurants of SF. Food is great. Our server Kat did a perfect job. Interior is nice. Kitchen is  visible. Bartender brought our drinks.   Nice place. Will come here again soon.,Awesome food and ambiance in a neighborhood. NYC type of vibe for such a cute spot. Bar is awesome seating and experience.,Overall: 9/10 experience at Pearl. We found this spot simply by realizing we haven't ventured into the Richmond enough and simply googling around. While I was interested in something light with seafood offerings, my boyfriend was craving pasta and this was a perfect middle ground.What we ordered:- Drinks: Trediberri, Barbera, by the glass ($13)    - Drinks menu had a great variety of ages and varietals. Though the Wine menu looks a bit overwhelming at first glance for beginner wine drinkers, the limited ""By the Glass"" optionality narrows the selection just enough to be approachable, but still provide balanced.- Appetizers: Acme Bread and Butter ($4) and Roasted Cauliflower ($13)    - The Acme bread was perfectly warm and we found the flaky salt sprinkled on top of the butter to be a nice touch. The only thing I would change here is perhaps adding just a bit more butter on the plate.    - Cauliflower was not too crispy and not too soft, a mix between warm and crunchy with the shaved almonds on top. I prefer my cauliflower a little softer while Dylan prefers it on the more firm side when cooked, and we both really enjoyed this dish.- Main Course: Seared Scallops ($30) and Handkerchief Pasta ($22)    - The scallops hit the spot for me. I wanted something light and summery, and these just melted in my mouth. Found the presentation to be a nice +1 as well.    - The Handkerchief pasta is one of their most famous dishes, it sounds, as Stuart told us it is one of the only dishes that is never taken off the menu. All of Pearl's pasta is fresh and homemade, and that rang true with this dish.Other: Heard the scallops may be off the menu as they are seasonal, so if you are excited about this menu item - hurry over to Pearl! Staff was incredibly friendly, clearly knew the menu well. The staff also replaced all of our silverware after our appetizer course, which we found to be a nice touch.As most restaurants in SF, I do wish the inside was larger as it looked very aesthetically pleasing and it would have been great to snag a table inside. But for making a reservation day-of on a Sunday, we had a very nice table outside. :) Special shoutout to Stuart, our server at Pearl. Thank you!Great kitchen and a great way to support a female chef. :),Fine dining in a quiet neighborhood. Visited on a weekday at opening time (5pm) to secure a seat and skip reservations.You might consider Pearl an even more upmarket version of Fiorella just a few blocks down. Prices are even higher, and portions are smaller, but dishes are cooked exquisitely - like what you'd expect in a restaurant in a 5-star hotel.Ordered the bread which was fresh and came with salted butter for an appetizer, with swordfish as the entree. Finished with a delicious panna cotta.Take note that they bundle a 4% health tax together with SF's standard 8.5% tax on the receipt.,One of the best meals I've had in SF in a long long time. The combination of unique flavors, generous portion sizes, and seasonal menu items really sold it for me.We started with the steak tartare and the tuna crudo - both were excellent. Texture was fantastic, and the sauces topping both were a perfect pairing.For the main I got the crab gemelli, which had a perfect level of light spice from the sliced red chile peppers in it, and a generous helping of fresh, melt in your mouth dungeness crab.Since the appetizers and mains were so good, we went all in on desert and got three - the guava sorbet (incredibly balanced, not too sweet, a great palate cleanser), the chocolate tart (not too rich or sweet, great cream on top), and the spiced upside down cake (gingerbread esque and amazing). Will definitely be going back here - the pastas are so unique and well prepared, and everything else we had was as interesting and tasty.,The cutest restaurant in Inner Richmond -- my bf & I came on a Tuesday night and there were a good amount of people. We had reservations so we didn't have to wait too long -- I would recommend making reservations on Resy but you can also request to sit at the bar to avoid the wait. The drinks were delicious and very unique. Be sure to ask what their speciality drinks are. Things we ordered:- Acme Bread and Butter (warm, fresh, and crispy) - 4/5- Spaghetti (by far, the best spaghetti I've ever had, it was so good, we ordered this dish twice). ***MUST ORDER*** - 5/5- Grilled Swordfish - the fish was moist and the white beans complimented the fish well - 4/5- Seared Scallops - I still dream about this dish, the scallops were perfectly cooked and paired well with the risotto - 5/5I highly recommend giving this place a try if you're looking for a cute date night :) it's also great for coming with friends as the restaurant can also accommodate big parties.,Was introduced to this restaurant by a friend and haven't had a bad experience since returning. I've introduced my friends to this restaurant and the crowd favorite is the steak tartare. It's one of the best you can find in the Bay Area. Handkerchief pasta always seems to be a staple on the menu and is absolutely delicious and lightly creamy with the perfect ratio of sauce for the noodles. Pork chop and beans had a delicious Smokey tone which I normally don't prefer but enjoyed this one time I had it. Also very moist and thick! Can't recommend this place more!,*** In Short ***Delicious dishes that surprise and delight.*** In Depth ***Pearl was, hands-down, the best new restaurant I've been to since the beginning of COVID. And while that might not be saying much given I largely stuck to places I'd previously frequented, Pearl stood out, even among those. While not every dish was a smashing success, every one was enjoyable, and more-over, every one was _interesting_: the first bite of every new dish was a delightful surprise because we'd imagine a particular flavor, and while we would get that, we'd also get a little something extra that we totally weren't expecting, that just worked so well with the rest of the flavors.While you can't go too wrong with their menu, some of the standouts included their cauliflower, duck confit, gnocchi, radiatore, panna cotta, and devil's food cake.Solid 4.5 stars that I'm dying to go back to so I can try more of their menu!***Accessibility Info***Venue - Outdoor seating was fairly spacious and accessible, but be warned, even with the heaters, it can get pretty chilly out there at night, given the proximity to the water.,This place is incredible! The ambiance inside is so cozy and comfortable, the food is amazing, and the service was good! It's a perfect spot for a date night or dinner with a friend. The food here is so unique and everything we ordered was cooked to perfection. Highly recommend the scallops, little gem, and crudo but you couldn't go wrong no matter what you get.,Pearl is on our rotation.  Consistently well prepared offerings. The crudo, any version of it, is a must.,Very decent place. They were full on reservations when I called but they always keep a few tables open for walk-ins. For a Friday night the wait was 20-30 minutes - not bad. Interior is pretty casual but the food is top notch. Halibut crudo appetizer (not pictured) was very limey with lao gan ma sauce. Everyone orders the handkerchief pasta and it's easy to see why. Seared scallops were salty but the bed of corn mixture gave it a good balance.,Good food, wine, music, decor, staff and price. Perfect date place but di reservation beforehand,Spontaneous date night after walking the dog! We came here on a weeknight without reservations and we're lucky enough to get a table outside with our pup. The host let us know they typically save a few tables for walk-ins. By the time we were seated there was a wait. All the food was delicious and fresh. You can't go wrong with ordering anything on the menu. Even the bread was amazing and worth paying the $4 for. Their handkerchief pasta is one of their more popular dishes and it did not disappoint. Not too heavy but the right balance of flavors with the meat and cheese. I took some home for leftovers and it still tasted good the day after. The chicory salad was a little salty with the pancetta and garlic croutons but still good. For the oysters you can order by the piece at $3 a pop. Not sure what kind of oysters we had but they tasted very fresh. To top it off I got the  lemon panna cotta dessert. Not to sweet and a perfect end to the meal. Notes: -Heating lamps outside to keep you warm. -Indoor seating is available and they have a bar area. -Parking in the area can be a bit challenging but if you go 1-2 blocks away you can find some open spots. -Nice spot for a date night or to bring visitors from out of town -Very friendly and attentive waitstaff,Even thought we were about 15mins late to our reservation, we still got seated right away when we arrived. They seated us in a cute booth. The restaurant is super cute inside and they have plants hanging by the windows. Every dish that we ordered was delicious and flavorful. My favorite dish is the Seared Ahi Tuna Crudo! Each dish serves about 2-3 people. I can't wait to come back and try more dishes! Bathroom situation: there's only one bathroom stall by the kitchen Fun fact: I was told it was a once a laundromat and they still have the same floors.,One of my favorite restaurants in all of SF. The crudo so tasty. Light and refreshing, with savory fish sauce and sweet strawberries. It's a good shareable item. Oysters are also always fresh. The cauliflower on black tahini hummus is also so tasty. I'm not even a hummus fan, but I love how it pairs with the cauliflower. The handkerchief pasta is a staple here, but last time I went I ordered the squid ink pasta and it is to die for. Highly recommend. Every time I've dined here, the food has been incredible. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. They currently have indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor setting is nice with string lights above",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and heat lamps. The ambiance has a cool, relaxed vibe. Great spot for a date night without feeling stuffy.,Ordered a steak from the hangar, which was delivered to my table in forty-five minutes. There was no more than 2-3 ounces of steak. Thirty bucks is a scam,i dream about their handkerchief pasta and every time i go back and have it, it's exactly how i remembered, perfect. this has to be my favorite restaurant in the outer richmond. the vibes, the staff, the outdoor patio, the dogs, 10/10. also don't skip out on their bread & any seafood that they have on their appetizers!!,The restaurant is  nice. Food and Drink  is so tasty. IG : Sunnys.Secret⁣FB: Sunnys Secret,I first noticed Pearl on a visit to Pizzetta 211, a wonderful little (previously little, as since the pandemic they have expanded) artisan pizza place, which I just learned is Pearl's sister restaurant. Both the plates and the ambiance at Pearl looked, good so my gf and I made a mental note to return. And return we did over the weekend. The outdoor area is cute and the service is very good. We began with some bread, which came out hot. It was a perfect specimen of petite bread loaf: crusty on the outside and light/fluffy on the inside. For our entrees, I ordered the scallops and my gf ordered the radiatore. Both were excellent. I always like scallops," and these were lovely: slightly caramelized on the top and bottom and succulent perfection on the inside. One thing that really pushed me to choose this dish was that it was prepared with """"chhonk""""", which I thought was a made-up word, but which I found upon a quick tableside Google search was an exotically spiced sort of butter. Anyway, the chhonk added a delightful dimension to the risotto and fennel. The whole thing was great. My gf's radiatore was better. The heaviness of the lamb was delicious and well balanced by the creaminess of the ricotta and brightness of the lemon. The texture was also fabulous: the combination of the softness of the pasta, the grit of the lamb, and the crunch of the pistachio came together beautifully. I would recommend this highly.,Very nice place. Liked it so much. I came here for the first time a few weeks ago and was really happy with my food. So we decided to spend our day off dinner here with my boyfriend. We enjoyed the food it was so delicious! Everything was really tasty and well seasoned. My food was so fresh and the taste was just magnificent. Paired with a glass of wine I couldn't ask for a better meal.Staff was super friendly. Really great customer service.Prices are pretty reasonable and the portions are good.Everything very clean: from the outside to the restrooms.Would definitely recommend this place.,*Mission*Evening dinner with my food partner in crime to enjoy some new food and the SF weather. Also to support local businesses is a plus! *Ordered*Steak tartare ($15), local halibut crudo ($15), and seared scallops ($29). With a cocktail: Bird's Eye -Steak tartare (shared plate): pretty good overall. Served with potato chips so finger food item. Shareable plate and prepared similar to steak tartare we've had in Paris except no egg on top which most steak/beef tartares to enhance the flavor. -Local halibut crudo: very fresh and a nice appetizer to share that is light enough to not spoil the main course. They do add what seemed to taste like a similar Vietnamese fish sauce I have had before that adds saltiness and umami flavor, so just something to note when trying. It did leave us wanting more though!-Seared scallops: if you enjoy scallops, definite recommendation. Perfectly cooked with butter and hint of salt, not chewy or dried out with each bite. You get 4 pieces on top of some mash/fresh sweet corn which went well when paired with the scallop pieces if you enjoy salty sweet combos. Otherwise, eating each separate was also a delight!-Birds Eye: nothing too spectacular about this cocktail, tasted like an old fashion at the end of the day.*Restaurant*at the corner of the street with a lot of outdoor seating and some seating indoors but it was busy when we went around 6pm on a Friday. We had reservations to sit outside, but some were able to get seats as walk-ins with a wait. Overall, service was great and the food came out at a reasonable time with drinks despite being packed. Pro tip: There was the typical SF wind sitting outside, but our table had a heat lamp above which some of the outdoor tables have. If you need to request one in advance remember to ask them!,Ambience is amazing. Food is some of the best we have had in San Francisco. Can't wait to come back!! Service and staff are great as well.,Sadly they no longer do takeout which is a bit unfortunate though I guess makes sense given it's a pretty small and busy place. I did get a chance to stop by in person so thought I'd write an updated review.Reservations: I've seen them really slammed when they were outdoor only but now with a mix of indoor and outdoor tables, it did seem a bit less wild. That being said, I would definitely make a reservation if you can. There was nothing available on a Saturday night initially but I signed up for a Resy alert and there ended up being a bunch of indoor and outdoor tables that opened. No idea if that was a fluke or happens regularly but if you are thinking about going to Pearl 6101 and there are no reservations available, I don't think there is any reason to not be notified if something opens up.Parking: It's pretty bad which I will never really understand about this part of the Richmond. If you get lucky, you'll eventually find something but definitely don't recommend driving if you have the option. Food: The food here is really good. Highlights for me were the chicory caesar, pastas (basically all the ones I've tried), and the seared scallops with spaetzle and vegetables. The steak was also really nicely cooked and tasty but the different items on the plate didn't really complement each other like the scallop dish and its sides did. The hot out of the oven Acme bread with soft butter is also delicious and worth ordering to munch on.  Dessert was delicious too.  I'd definitely suggest ordering a few different things from each section and sharing. Price wise, it's not cheap but the portion sizes are pretty good especially on the appetizers and pastas and the quality of all the ingredients seems excellent. Overall: It's four stars from me partially because there have been some dishes I've had that were alright but had some minor issues. They definitely excel at balancing different flavors and textures. The service was fine, not amazing but part of that might be how busy they were. Cocktail list is solid, though they won't make any modifications, even leaving things out, which seems kind of odd but oh well. For dining in, I would come back here again if it was convenient but wouldn't rush back. Four stars from me.,This is seriously one of the best pastas I've ever had, including many meals in Italy. This is a destination for amazing food. The outside dining is nothing notable at all. It's not pretty or attractive. It's just utilitarian. But it helps to avoid covid and the service is very attentive. The cocktails were just delicious. I highly recommend having one instead of a glass of wine.,Best overall meal I've had in a long time with SF dining coming back. Pearl 6101 has a great date/intimate vibe, low lit at dinner and not too quiet or too loud. The interior is so cute, and the outside is lit up with bistro lights and looks super inviting. But the drinks and food took a great spot over the top. I had the Franciscan Wallflower to drink and I can't remember what my hubs had but they were both excellent cocktails. They have a good wine list, with a small but great by-the-glass selection. They had 2 beers available. We got the asparagus, and I don't normally like asparagus and it was SO good. We almost ordered a 2nd order. We also got the roasted goat cheese with strawberries and it was also excellent. I had the handkerchief as the main and my hubs had the hanger steak. It's nearly impossible to get a white sauce pasta that isn't too heavy but the handkerchief was sooooo freaking good and light. The couple next to us got the octopus and I will def be heading back to try that and the rest of the menu. Also would love to check out the brunch. They have a decently large interior (for sf) and a large parklet that is well appointed with lights and heat lamps. We ate inside so can't speak to how warm the patio is, but it looks like  it would get sun during the day. They take reservations on Resy. So pleased I found this place. Same people own/run this as Pizzetta 211 which is next door and has AMAZING pizza. Check it out.,Pearl is perfect for any occasion - date night, work dinner, birthday, making it through the day. The ambiance is cozy, yet aesthetically pleasing. The menu is perfectly composed and the cocktails and wine options compliment the items on the menu. My colleague and I started with the oysters, local acme bread and salted butter and then split the Hamachi Crudo, Seared Scallops with dill spaetzle, romano beans, cherry tomatoes, espelette, and the Spaghetti with tuna conserva, spicy anchovies, tomato confit, capers, breadcrumbs. I was painfully full and yet I couldn't stop eating the spaetzle and all of the accompaniments on the scallop dish. There are so many good restaurants in SF, but Pearl is fresh and constant and home base worth making part of your regular routine.,it genuinely puzzles me why staff at restaurants in charge of reservations and seating can be rude. isn't your job to encourage diners to seat at your restaurants, especially when the customers literally have soo many alternatives?anyway, we wanted to try Pearl based on all the great reviews. we didn't get to. the person handing reservations/seating were rude and snobby. if you can't even carry on a conversation with a prospective customer without having attitudes, you don't deserve our money and I think perhaps the services and hospitality industry isn't for you.,Pearl 6101 Ratings: 4.4/5 Food: 4.5/5 - We had two oysters and the acme bread as our snacks. Oysters were fresh, delicious, but sadly there were only two left for the night. The bread came out hot and pillowy soft, tasted amazing with the butter. For starters, the roasted cauliflower for sure blew my mind. The smoky black tahini hummus with chermoula, crushed almonds, and raisins added a good twist and texture to the dish. Cauliflower was crunchy, but not raw. The dish was a bit sour and acidic, but opened up our pallets. Seared tuna crudo was interesting too, especially the puffed wild rice on top and salsa verde was great. Both pasta were phenomenal, just too salty. The handkerchief was a white Bolognese sauce with granan padano, sauce was meaty and homey. The spaghetti with tuna, spicy anchovies was lovely. The bread crunch on the top was a nice touch, love the fusion twist. Great al dente and chewy pastas too. Lastly, the seared scallops were divine, just too salty agan, but the pickled grape and barley salad on the side was amazing. I would say it tasted better than the scallops, LOL. Salad was refreshing, and helps with the saltiness. They are excellence at balancing out flavors and textures, but the pastas and entrees were all too salty; we had to drink a lot of water. Ambiance: 4.5/5 - Located in a quiet neighborhood in inner Richmond, and probably one of the cutest restaurant for a date night. The ambiance is cozy, yet also aesthetically pleasing; pretty flowers as décor. It is dimly lit with candles on every table, so definitely gives off a fancy and romantic vibe, but more on the causal side. Great spot for any meals and occasions, and I would say this place is a gem. We both had a great time on our date. Price: 4.25/5 - For dinner, we got two snacks: oysters and acme bread with butter, two starters: seared tuna crudo and roasted cauliflower, two pastas: handkerchief and spaghetti, and finally one entrée, the seared scallops. Yes, that was a lot of food for the two of us, but we can eat a lot, LOL. The total after tax and tips were around $135. Agreed that all dishes were set at a pretty reasonable prices and good quality. Service: 4.25/5 - All the staffs here are extraordinary and excellent. When we arrived, the host greeted us and handed us a menu while we wait on the bench outside, very cute. The staff came out and ask if we needed some water while we waited. Our server was attentive and good at what he was doing. The only downside was that the food took a while to come out, so there was a bit of a wait. Our server was backed up too, since he had multiple tables to take care of, but was understandable. BLUF: This place has lots of potential. They nailed each dish on the flavors and textures. Everything was amazing, and the only downside was some of the dishes were way too salty, otherwise it would be perfect. I highly recommend the oysters, roasted cauliflower, and the spaghetti. Make sure to try it out and make sure to call ahead for a reservation.,It was amazing!  My favorite dish was the scallops with couscous. I loved everything! .,This is one of my goto restaurants for friends in town. Always an excellent meal at a fair price. The menu changes but is fresh and creative. Drinks are unique; servers are knowledgeable about the menu and attentive.,After trying the delicious food at their sister pizza restaurant next door, I wanted to try Pearl's California/Mediterranean cuisine. With outside and indoor seating available, we made reservations on Resy for an indoor table for four since we didn't want to chance the possibility of the cold and foggy weather in the Richmond district. We had to book three weeks out for a Saturday night reservation.Arriving at our 5:30 time, we were promptly seated at a window table. Our waitress answered questions we had about the menu items and we decided to share some starters before our entrees.Oysters on a half shell - the oysters were very fresh with a sweet and briny taste to them. They were topped with some fermented hot sauce, horseradish, lemon and dill on top.Local Halibut Crudo - the fresh slices of halibut had a mixture of strawberry, marcona almond, nuoc cham, serrano and cilantro. Very tasty.Chicory Caesar was topped with crispy prosciutto, roasted garlic croutons, shaved parmesan. Not your typical Caesar salad or Romaine lettuce. The salad consisted of lightly dressed mixed greens. It was probably our least favorite of our dishes.Roasted Cauliflower - the cauliflower sits on top of black tahini hummus and topped with green chermoula, almond slivers, and golden raisins. This was so delicious. Wished we had ordered some bread to sop up the hummus.Entrees:Kobe Bavette Steak - the perfectly cooked slices of medium rare steak were on top of roasted eggplants, sweet peppers and harissa with a side of cucumber salad. Delicious!Seared Scallops - the nicely seared scallops were atop dill spaetzle, romano beans, cherry tomatoes slices and espelette. Had a taste of the scallops and they had a nice sear and were tasty.Grilled Swordfish - tomato-braised white beans, pickled pepper-olive relish, basil aioli. Friend enjoyed his swordfish entrée.Overall it was a delicious meal and all four of us enjoyed it. Efficient and friendly service by our server. Recommend and we'll be back again.,Lots of potential here. Food combinations were inventive, but everything was a little too much taste. Steak was delicious but no carb and no side option. My foodie 8yo loved the steak," but was """"still hungry"""" after (she wasn't after she waited a minute). Scallops were cooked perfectly", dill spaetzel worked and not too dilly. All the dishes had a spice component which was not necessarily needed, like on the sunflower seeds in the salad, but was also not bad. I'll comeback with my husband, but not necessarily a go to place for me.,Update: Looks like Covid is over and some places are back to complacency.  That was really the vibe we got on 4/19/22.  We live in this neighborhood and as you can see from our reviews we like to eat local.  We came in about 5 for an early dinner - no problem with getting an outdoor table with a view of the front door.  The host was abrupt and I never saw an ounce of personality from him.  The server was quiet and professional but quite frankly the service was flat - not just ours but at all the tables.  Hubs ordered an ice tea - came in a tall skinny cocktail glass of about 6 oz.  Which he drank right up.  It took a loooong time and had to ask 3 people to get a refill.  And, call me petty, but they charged for a refill.  The Green Garlic Pasta was too salty, the Spaghetti with gulf shrimp was just plain.   We both left hungry.  We had skipped apps to save room for dessert which we decided to have somewhere else.  Ended up at a pizza place for dessert! Overall - there are soooo many local places that are welcoming, gracious and less pretentious.,Really wanted to give this place 5 star. Really cozy heated outside area. Some complain it's dark, but I loved it. Fresh nicely garnished oysters, a bit overpriced. Steak tratar with homemade chips--superb. Little Gem was a centerpiece of the evening, one of the best I've head with perfect ajoli, tiny seasoned popcorn, little pieces of what tasted like heirloom tomatoes. However gnocchi disappointed. The texture was too dense, like in a supermarket kind. The cacophony of too many not bound together eclectic ingredients, like pesto, some yellow sauce, cherry tomatoes, herbs, sweet corn, chanterelles, which also tasted bland like if they were boiled--preparation that wouldn't allow the flavors of these delicious mushrooms to pop. I gave half of the dish to the local doggo. Very sweet doggo by the way.The waiter was running around super busy, checked on me only once, never allowed more than 30 seconds for an (initiated by me each time) interaction--not that kind of service you'd expect at restaurants which charges $30 for a gnocchi dish. The host was stuck-up and not at all friendly. Will probably give this place another chance primarily for the outside sitting and the Little gem, but not at all sure they will deliver the rest.,This place is so cool! The food is amazing. Portion size is just right. The ambience has such a good vibe. The lighting is perfect. It's understated, with no real signage on front. It's on the corner, has great outdoor seating available as well. Waitstaff is super friendly. We just moved to Lake Street and this will be a frequent haunt of ours!,Pearl is as lovely as it gets for a neighbor corner restaurant. The small west coast oysters with hot sauce already in them are a perfect starter. The Cesar salad is the stuff of childhood dreams and far better than anything I remember from growing up frequently eating them. Agnolotti with mushrooms and white sauce, incredible. The steak was perfectly cooked and severed over delightful veggies. The wait staff are super friendly and really amazing. The rye based cocktail was something really really special as someone who prefers a classic rye Manhattan. They even gave my dog a raw hide to settle in as we ate outside under the night sky and a heat lamp. Last, we finished with the huckleberry chocolate desert to celebrate my fiancé's birthday.,Every time I've passed by Pearl, every table has been occupied. I'm so glad I finally got a chance to try it! I was able to snag a reservation for dinner the day of.My boyfriend and I split the chicory caesar salad, steak tartare, and handkerchief pasta, and honestly were full from just those three dishes. Every single item was AMAZING. I had never had crispy prosciutto before but it was so crunchy and tasty. The lavash and garlic sauce that came with the tartare made each bite extremely flavorful and satisfying. The pasta was creamy and cheesy and the perfect dish to satiate our hunger. This is the definitely the type of restaurant where people come to wine and dine and take their time. As someone who really only cares about the quality of food, I still enjoyed myself.,I love the mushroom spaghetti here and the cocktails are also very tasty. Will come back next time to try more dishes here! Parking was not easy around this neighborhood tho.,Had this bookmarked for a while! I thought it was good but wouldn't make a special trip to come here (30 min drive for us). The crab pasta we had was our least favorite dish. Best was the crudo. Also had the Caesar (but too salty for me) and the trout. Drinks and service were good,For brunch, dinner, appetizers and drinks or just dessert, this place is a gem. The servers are extraordinary, the food is excellent, and the ambiance is very comfy yet polished.This is a great place for a date night, impressing the fam, or having a small friend reunion brunch. Drinks $13 Mains ~$20Appetizers ~$10,Everything here was absolutely delicious and it's such a cute little spot!We got the oysters, bread & butter, handkerchief pasta and Duck Milanese.Oysters were fresh and the fermented hot sauce just takes it up a notch. While waiting for our entrees we were super hungry and got the bread but the entrees ended up coming out before the bread lol. BUT THE BREAD IS AWESOME - perfectly baked, so fresh and chewy no ragrets.Handkerchief pasta has an interesting white bolognese sauce, I really liked it because it's lighter than a usual red sauce and very flavorful! The pasta was super fresh as well, definitely recommend.The duck Milanese is super interesting, kinda reminds me of a katsu but the mustard sauce and peas go super well with it.YUMMAY YUMMMAY MEAL,I've only been here twice --- once for brunch and once for dinner but I can see why this place has a cult following.  Both times there was a hopeful crowd outside the door.  The people who hadn't gotten reservations but might get an early table.  The food is absolute perfection.  Pick anything and it will be spectacular.  Make sure to start with a drink, even if you are having brunch.  My favorite is wine --- sparkling (brunch, but ALWAYS appropriate) or still (love their reds).  Not to miss are the cold, fresh local oysters.  The roasted cauliflower with almonds and golden raisins was so flavorful.  My friend and I each had the grilled hangar steak.  It came with hen of woods mushrooms and the most delicious don't-talk-to-me-I'm-eating potatoes, super crispy and buttery. We ended with the chocolate creme caramel, which had cocoa nibs in it.  That meal was incredible.  Note: it was so lovely that we overstayed our welcome, which was a no-no.  The management was very generous with us but at some point we did have to leave as others were patiently waiting.  Until next time, Pearl...,The food was delicious and the service was excellent! We made a reservation a few weeks ahead of time (something to be mindful of). The day of, we arrived at the restaurant about 5 minutes early. Once there we got seated pretty quickly, the restaurant had just opened up. The service was incredible, the staff was highly attentive and very courteous. We ordered some drinks along with the Acme Bread and Chicory Caesar. The bread was warm and fresh and the salad was crunchy and delicious. We also ordered the Ricotta Gnocchi and the Grilled Swordfish, and the Chocolate Torte for dessert, everything was delicious. The gnocchis specifically had a very refreshing taste. Overall the experience was great, We plan on going again to try out the rest of the menu.,I cannot complain about Pearl! We reserved a table a few weeks in advance for our anniversary dinner. Before we arrived they texted to confirm our reservation on the day of. Parking can be a little difficult since it's only street parking and spots stay taken. We arrived and were seated immediately at our outdoor table, which had a heat lamp right above it.To start off we got some cocktails, oysters, and the acme bread. The cocktails are pretty delicious all around. The oysters were very fresh and the acme bread was nice and sweet. For our entrees, we got the seared scallops and the bavette steak. Both were delicious! The scallops came with risotto unlike any risotto we've had before. The steak came with cucumbers which added a very nice crunch and peppers which gave a nice kick. Both were delicious!For dessert we had the panna cotta. There were many textures on it, from jiggly to crunchy. It came with a peach compote that made the dish.I would definitely recommend this place!,Friendly staff and absolutely delicious and inventive food! We tried the crudo the first night it was on the menu and it was exquisite! We thought we might be cold eating outside in 50 degree weather but the heating elements the restaurant has were great!,This is a wonderful and quintessential SF spot to take your friends and family who are visiting from out of town. Located in the Richmond area, the restaurant takes over a corner of a relatively lively street. Note that it is an outdoors only venue at this time and the patio isn't protected/sheltered from the wind (although there are heat lamps). Luckily, we went during a warm, sunny evening so the patio was the perfect spot for dinner.Ambience/service - 5 stars. Even though the place was pretty busy, our server was attentive and our food came out promptly. With the outdoor setup, the restaurant had a wonderful European vibe to it with drinks and conversations flowing.Food/drinks - 4.5 stars. The cocktails were amazing! You really can't go wrong with anything on the cocktail menu, from the interesting Pearl Martini to the sweety and bubbly Coastal Scrub. Cocktails are a good price at $13! For food, would recommend the squid ink pasta and the steak. I had the scallop risotto and was super impressed with the scallops (I had 5 on my plate! Unheard of in SF) but not so much with the risotto that came with it (tasted very much of just...corn).Again, I think this is a great place to bring your out of town friends/family for a not too pricy but still fancy meal.,I love this place. We first tried it as takeout during the height of the pandemic and fell in love with their pastas and cocktails. When we were looking for a new apartment last year, prospective places got extra points if they were close to Pearl and Pizzetta. Now we live 3 blocks away and it is SO amazing to have them in the neighborhood. We're very covid cautious so we've never dined inside, but we've had several wonderful meals outdoors here. Their outdoor setup is great - on a Slow Street so not a ton of traffic or people walking very close to your table. Tables are well spaced and heaters are strong and effective. I don't know that it would be a pleasant experience in the rain because only a few tables are under anything, but when it's just a bit chilly it's still quite lovely. Service has always been good. Their drinks are always excellent - I'm especially partial to the Pearl Martini but I've liked everything I've tried. I love the caesar salad and we often get a few oysters to start. I also really enjoy their crudos. We were there for NYE and someone got the olives, which I thought seemed silly since I'm perfectly capable of opening a jar, but they were in fact special enough to merit ordering. Their pastas are consistently amazing - I'm drooling just thinking about them. The entrees are always perfectly executed and have really interesting side components (though sometimes I wish I had just gotten more pasta! but I'm a carb-o-holic). And save room for dessert because they're always inventive and delicious. I feel so lucky to have a place this excellent within stumbling distance of my home! Covid sucks but having such wonderful outdoor options has really made a huge difference in our lives.,I'm going to start off by saying I'm a snotty New Yorker and have been incredibly disappointed by the food in SF; I now walk into SF restaurants with some trepidation. Pearl 6101 has two dishes that are absolute stand-outs: the spaghetti (perfectly al dente with a lovely kick and yummy clams) and the chocolate creme caramel. I'm not usually a huge fan of chocolate desserts (I know, leave me alone), but the sesame cocoa nib brittle and creme caramel transformed this dish. It might be one of the best chocolate desserts I've had.The trout was also cooked perfectly, but everything surrounding it was so salty we didn't finish what was on the plate (rare for us). The chicory caesar would have been excellent except it, too, was too salty (and again, we left some on the plate, which makes me sad -- I love a good salad). The bread was, in my partner's words," """"basic"""" (still good)", and the oysters were OK.I'm learning that when an SF restaurant has 4.5 rating that I'm probably going to think it's a 4. Overall this was very, very good but wow, please notch down the salt!,So many great items... the handkerchief pasta, the spaghetti, the scallops or the hangar steak are all great choices. The halibut appetizer is amazing and full of flavor too. I wasn't a fan of the signature martini because I don't like gin but they have many other delicious craft cocktails to choose from.,five stars is not enough. pearl is my absolute favorite restaurant in the city. their menu is always evolving yet stays consistent. their cocktails and bar are top tier. the staff is always knowledgeable, friendly, and overall superb. the ambience is cozy and chill. great for celebrating or for dates or just because. you will not be disappointed.,Excellent food and service!Food: We had the marinated olives, hanger steak, and upside down cake. I can see Pearl from my living room window and think about that steak everyday.  The combination of ingredients on that plate comes together in perfect harmony. I also had a gin martini that was a perfect accompaniment to my steak. Service: We did not have a reservation and the host, Miles(?), was super nice and accommodated us after an hour and a half on the wait list. After being seated, we had another friend unexpectedly show up and the staff happily moved us to a different table. It was definitely not a classy move on our part but the staff was just incredibly nice about it, even though I'm sure it was very inconvenient for them.,i love pearl! it is a great neighborhood restaurant for a fancier night out. the menu changes with the seasons so i love to try new things. i have come for brunch and dinner and even came on my birthday! dishes like the octopus are well cooked and unforgettable. the space is decorated wonderfully and the servers are all very nice. it can get crowded so a tip is to make reservations and get ready for great meal.,Half of the staff look miserable. Smile a little! The service was flat from the host to the female bartender. The food is good but some items are pricey. Service left a bad taste in my mouth.,Very disappointed. Ordered the Hangar Steak which took 45 minutes to get to my table. Was no bigger than 2-3 oz of steak. For $30, that's a rip-off.,In love with this place. Amazing staff INCREDIBLE food amazing area. I could really go on and on Food : - oysters : so fresh and delish, recommend atleast getting yourself one- handkerchief pasta : best white sauce with the meat and cheese. Perfect combo. It was on the oilier side which I wish wasnt the case, but it was so incredible - scallops : came with seasoned risotto, and the scallops were seared to PERFECTION!!! A really good size as well- panna cotta : perfect way to end. It was light and flavorful. Next time I want to try the chocolate torte, but I was too full to have something that heavy Pls come here it's so amazing. Will 100% be back to try everythjng else on this menu!!!,Pros: The Food - excellent! Elevated flavors. Really enjoyed Seared Tuna Crudo, Steak Tartare, Roasted Cauliflower, Handkerchief pasta, Grilled Swordfish, Seared Scallops, Duck Leg Confit. Can't wait to return!,Wow. This place should not be as easy as it is to get a table. It's been a while since I've had such a surprising meal at a mid price point restaurant in SF. It used to be our sweet spot as a city but we lost so many good spots over the pandemic. We kept our order simple: Oysters, salad, pasta, seafood. The depth of a simple dish like a Caesar salad with Radicchio added a peppery punch with the amazing dressing. Entrees wise I opted for the gnocchi and the scallops and I am glad I did. The pesto, corn, charred tomato combo was a huge winner. The scallops we got were on a bed of corn, Spaetzle," chili oil and pickled onion. Absolutely delish. I scrapped a good mix of the ingredients in my first spoonful and while tasting I was already thinking of my return visit. The only miss were the oysters. The accompanying ingredients didn't do anything for the oysters. I would probably opt for another appetizer (there are some other good ones) on my next visit. We ended the meal with an absolutely amazing fruit Galette and """"the best scoop of pistachio ice cream"""" I as a half persian man have ever had in my life. I am pretty sure they used pistachio extract in the making. I've never had any pistachio ice cream hit so hard before. Unreal good. I will return for a punch bowl of it.",Stellar service quality and atmosphere. The food was creative and simply delectable. It is a pleasure to save five star reviews for places like this.,10/10 would recommend. great atmosphere, great food, amazing service, friendly staff! an amazing richmond gem. we're from the neighborhood & this will now be a go-to! cocktails were delicious too. stewart was our server and they were so sweet, funny & helpful so a huge shout out to them!!,Picked up on this gem while looking for something to eat last night. We were not disappointed. The service was great and the food delicious. We got the Oysters, Steak Tartare, Squid Ink Pasta, and Strawberry Panna Cotta.Highly recommend checking them out,Pearl 6101 was a delightful treat. Their menu options are truly unique in the sense that they bring together food combinations that harmonize so beautifully together, yet you would never expect them to! My group and I ordered the oysters and roasted cauliflower as our appetizer. Both were incredibly delicious. The cauliflower had a very well balanced hummus coating and green chermoula sauce. They added almonds and golden raisins which added a perfect crunch to the fish! I ordered the Kobe steak which was tasty as well. Although I was not quite feeling the peppers and veggies that came with it, the steak was cooked to perfection -- the most amazing and juicy medium rare you could find. Easy to cut and seasoned well. Dessert was our favorite part! The Strawberry & Black Sesame Sundae was an odd ice cream pairing to me at first but it exceeded all expectations! It was so rich and creamy in texture. The favors blended beautifully with one another! There was a raspberry sauce on the bottom and some whipped cream on top that pulled everything together. Also -- the portion size was huge! They were 4 heaping scoops of sundae in a bowl! So filling.My colleagues ordered the apple tart which they loved! Additionally, service was exceptional. Our waiter was frequently attending to our table and an absolute joy.,First time there. Family with two teenagers. All of us loved it. Started with oysters and marinated olives. Oysters had a little kick and were pretty tasty. Things went up from there. Chicory salad was crunchy, well dressed, with perfect crotons. Heirloom tomatoes with ricotta and black garlic was really really tasty. Daughter and I shared steak with harissa and peppers. Great flavors and perfectly cooked. My favorite was spaghetti with tuna and spicy anchovies. Delicious and crisp breadcrumbs a great touch. My wife and son split scallops and radiatore with lamb merguez sugo. They were all smiles. Service was great and friendly. Very good Italian wine by the glass. Chef checked in which was cool. A+,A really excellent restaurant. The dishes, tuna crisp, oysters,hanger steak were all perfectly prepared and delicious.the butter beans with the steak were also amazing. The drinks innovative and well executed.  The place is a really nice environment, keeping the remodel from a laundromat in step with the vintage of the building and neighborhood. My service was friendly, and tried to handle special requests well.,Whomever handles reservations is WILDLY rude. Called to see if there was any chance of making our reservation from 4-6 which i can understand not working out but at least wanted to check, and she was so insanely rude and then proceeded to HANG UP ON ME. Fine if you cannot accomodate but at least try and be somewhat polite holy smokes.,How incredibly lovely. I've been meaning to come here for a couple of years and finally did for anniversary dinner. The food, drink, ambiance and service are all perfect. A new favorite in SF - will be back soon for sure.,The 3 of us had a very satisfying weeknight meal to celebrate a birthday. The meal was really great from first dish to last, and the service was top-notch. I could really tell that the kitchen was highly-skilled, and the waitstaff was very well-trained.We started by sharing 3 starters. The Brandade Fritters ($6) were very good, but there were only 2 small fritters. The Little Gem Lettuce ($13) was flavorful and full of nice flavors and textures, and enough for the 3 of us to all enjoy. The Blistered Shishito Peppers ($12) were the favorite of the table, with a very nice baba ganoush to balance the only-slightly spiciness of the peppers.We share shared a pasta and 2 entrees. The Handkerchief ($19) was very well-executed - flavorful, and the pasta was cooked just right. I'm glad we shared the dish, because it is quite heavy for one person to eat it all. The Kobe Bavette Steak ($29) was very tender and tasty with no fat or gristle. The server didn't bother asking how we wanted the steak done, and it was served medium rare just as it has to be. The Grilled Octopus ($29) was tender, smoky, and the butterbeans and chimichurri-like sauce was really good. One of the better octopus presentations (and we order it almost every time it is offered).Finally, we shared 3 desserts. The Chocolate Creme Caramel ($10) was very rich and deeply flavorful. The Lemon Pound Cake ($10) was light, and the peaches were great. The Strawberry and Black Sesame Ice Cream Sundae ($11) was yummy and a huge portion; we almost couldn't finish it, but manned up and got it done.One more nod to the service. Although the restaurant and the patrons were fairly casual, the service was really top notch - attentive, precise, and very well-trained. It made the meal very pleasant.Finally, as advertised, parking in the neighborhood is very challenging.I would highly-recommend Pearl 6101, and look forward to coming back.,This place is a gem! The name fits perfectly.  The flavors of all the dishes are nicely balanced/coordinated and out of the ordinary. We ordered a number of salad/veggie appetizers as well as a pasta and fish dish.  Every single thing that came out was met with rave reviews at our table.  I can't remember the last time that's happened. Kudos to Pearl 6101 for creating such a wonderful meal and menu. And also for having such helpful and pleasant staff. I can't wait to come try out new dishes as the menu changes throughout the year.,We managed to sneak in a reservation when someone else cancelled - and I'm so glad we came here! Firstly, the service is AMAZING. My friend and I couldn't decide on a wine, and she was so patient and friendly with us, letting us try a splash from two of the open bottles, and when we liked neither, she listened to our preferences and made a recommendation. The food is top-notch; I honestly can't remember another time I've had such good food. We ordered the oysters and shishito peppers to start - oysters were wonderful; peppers were delightfully roasted, had a nice crisp texture, and the aioli it came with complemented it nicely. We shared the seared scallops and kobe bavette steak - and here's another shoutout to the incredible service because she gave us two additional plates so we could split the entrees without us having to ask! The seared scallops were perfection (and my favourite, though both dishes were great): light, buttery, flakey, and paired so well with the risotto, which was creamy and light as well. The kobe bavette steak and eggplant were rich and flavorful.Loved the interior of the space - it was very cute. Would 100% recommend coming here - if I lived in the city or closer to it, I would definitely visit more often!,Excellent food and drink. Roasted squash was flavorable and complex. Excellent main dishes, drinks and atmosphere.,The food is amazing. Crudo was phenomena, spicy, curry notes that perfectly compliment the fish and so was the gnocchi - perfectly tender pillows without any density. The cocktails are on point too.  The wait can be long and the staff isn't the friendliest. But I'll put up with it for great food.,Amazing food !Wonderful service House made pasta Get the handkerchief pasta with white bolgnese Awful parking situation Take an Uber and save the stressJYW highly recommends for all the right reasonsVery clean decorA bit noisy on Mother's day but hey get used to it.   Loved the whole dining experience from start to finish.,Talk about over rated. Just because it's in the Richmond doesn't mean it's superb. Slow service, aight food. One star for okay food and slow service.  Trust me on this, I've been around.,Amazing food, amazing wait staff. Food was healthy," cooked to perfection. Can't wait to go back!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wooden Spoon,"Amazing drinks, delicious food, cute decor, and super cool staff. Specifically picked this location because the reviews said they had good vegan options and one of the people in our group was vegan. We all loved what we ordered. I got the hash and a Bloody Mary (I was hungover lol). Loved the pickled veggies in both. My friend got the Honey Bee cocktail and it looked AMAZING - will definitely be trying it next time I'm in. There was quite a long line to get seated but it moved really fast. Seemed like they had a good amount of seating between the bar area and the tables. Since we sat at the bar the bartender took our food and drink orders and he was awesome. Didn't catch his name but was incredibly friendly, great service, and made our overall experience at Wooden Spoon go from great to amazing! Will definitely be back!,Highly recommend checking out Wooden Spoon. You almost miss it because it's right next to the The Swedish Music Hall. The wait was not terrible. They have a sign up sheet and you put your name and party size. The wait staff is pretty fast at seating people. I has the eggs Benedict sub potatoes for salad. They were super tasty. All of our food came out pretty fast. We were seated at the communal table and it was not awkward at all (lol). They waitress left a seat open on both sides to create a buffer. We didn't get a chance to try their cocktails but they looked great. Will definitely come back.,I honestly can't forgive myself for not discovering this place sooner! I've been taking my friends visiting the city to all of the wrong brunch spots... THIS is where it's at!I view this spot as very, very underrated. It seems that it doesn't get as much hype as it deserves. This is the kind of brunch spot that deserves to be raved about and featured all over reels and TikTok!We came on a Monday morning (the Monday right after Christmas) around 10:30 am. There was ample seating available, and we were offered the spot right by the window. Within five minutes, the restaurant filled up! So we came at the right time.Our server was Alissa, who also seated us. We ordered the soft scrambled eggs with salmon, greens, potatoes, and fruit, along with the house hash, which had short rib, eggs, mustard cream, and potatoes. My bf got the lemonade spritz and I got the hot chocolate. I don't know what else to say except that the meals were perfect. Everything we were expecting and more. Very interesting flavor combinations. We were very, very impressed.We received all of our orders quickly - and we were out of there within 40 minutes! Very impressive for a busy restaurant, and I'm highly impressed with the service - Alissa was very sweet and attentive, and she made sure that we were doing okay throughout our breakfast.We will definitely be back with friends. Now we know where to take them!,Bomb spot, difficult for groups but they make it work..just have some patience. I've always had to wait but it's a popular spot that isn't that big. The food is amazing and it's normal city prices, I only wish the portions were more generous. I finished my House Hash entree in literally 5 minutes. That's how good and small it was haha. Their pancakes with lemon curd and berries are served in a thin crepe like way, I could finish it by myself. It was sooo good. Definitely a place worth trying.,This place was really good! I'm not that big on scrambled eggs so I wasn't expecting to be wowed by my soft scramble order but it was so good! The salmon mixed in was perfect, and the dill crème on top went with eggs so deliciously. The potatoes were perfectly crispy and the salad was also on point. We got sat at the high top seating by the kitchen so it was really cool to see the chefs prepare everyone's orders. Our service was also great. We went here on a Sunday at noon and waited about ten minutes. I would definitely come back!,The French toast omg delicious!! Services okay cuz I went on the weekend and it was busy!! But the place inside is big,Wooden Spoon is a brunch classic! I've 'only' been here 3 times for catch-ups with friends, and after each experience I wonder why I don't come more often. The menu offers a great selection, whether you're looking for a sweet or savory breakfast or a more hearty lunch dish. I had a Mimosa along with the Market St. Benedict and it made for the perfect late lunch on a lazy weekend.They don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait by adding your name to their clipboard. Overall, definitely worth a visit!,What a dependable breakfast establishment! Usually Wooden Spoon has a line outside, but we went around  half past 10 on a rainy Saturday and were seated immediately at the bar. From here we overlooked the kitchen and chose our meals based on what we saw was being made and looked good!Bloody Mary was good, gave more hot sauce if you wanted. Huevos Divorciados had Vegan Chorizo but you wouldn't be able to tell. Actual quite a lot of Vegetarian items on the menu! French Toast was delicious and thick. Bacon and Potatoes were so good too! Food came so fast and we were out of there within a hour. We'll be back!My star rating:5  - must go!!! 4 - liked it, give it a try!3  - it was alright2  - I probably won't go back 1  - turnaround and run,Absolutely love this place! I had the rooster drink and it was delicious. Bourbon and cold brew, who knew? For food I had the huevos divorciados that included the house made vegan chorizo and it didn't disappoint. My friend had the pear Margarita and the granola crunch French toast. The French toast was delicious as well, I plan on having that on my next visit. Definitely recommend checking out the Wooden Spoon if you are looking for a great brunch spot!,Food is prepared in perfection the taste is just phenomenal. No condiments the taste is just perfect.When in SF you have to try.,Dog friendly brunch spot! The food is really pretty and aesthetically pleasing. Also love the ambiance: lively, pretty, and perfect for catching up with friends. Would recommend! :),Okay I had to come back here again because I was craving that soft scramble again! Once again my experience was the same just like before! This time I got a mimosa & it was made with freshly squeezed orange juice which made it taste better!The service here is amazing. They greet you immediately when you come in. Sat me very quickly and was served too. The food didn't take long to make. I love the consistency and how small the menu is. Not sure I want to try another dish because that soft scramble has my heart. I'm excited to try the crab version if it ever comes back!Definitely one my new favorite brunch spots. Probably will be here again soon!,Came here for brunch on New Year's Day and there was barely a wait for three. The morning bowl with fried chicken was delicious, and the textures and flavors really mashed well together. However, the extra $8 for the small amount of chicken was unjustifiable, so in hindsight it would've been more worth it to pay $3 for avocado or egg instead. The market st Benedict was great, but the house hash portion size was unexpectedly small.,Doris approved. Great brunch. New waiter. Wonderful selection of drinks and a self-serve wait list. When you go... don't ask anyone or talk to anyone first... put your name on the list! If all parties aren't there, you'll be skipped. Brunch was yum. We had a party of four and everyone plate was clean upon pickup. It's a great size plate. So you will (at least we felt) feel full but not stuffed! I highly recommend. In a great location froma beautiful park, and welcoming neighbor.,A group of 4 of us came to Wooden Spoon on a Sunday morning around 10 am for brunch after an early morning soccer game viewing at a nearby bar. We were all extremely hungry after a couple hours of adrenaline and shouting so we were eager to fill our bellies. The parking situation on Market St. is a bit tough on a Sunday but if you pull off onto a side street on the Wooden Spoon side, it's completely doable to find a spot within a few minutes! When we got to the front of the restaurant, we put our names down and we had about 6 or 7 parties in front of us - it made sense since it was the Sunday brunch rush.To make the wait pass by, we stopped by Ampersand to take a look at the various bouquets, cards, and handmade goods next door. It was a great way to pass the time and our table was called soon after we had finished perusing and window shopping!Overall, Wooden Spoon was a great place to grab a bite to eat for a group of 4. The decor on the walls were all - wait for it - wooden spoons and the service, speed, and experience was fantastic. The food was good and consistent with what I would expect from a well-known brunch spot but I wouldn't say it blew me away! I didn't get to try other dishes that my friends had gotten but I'll give my review based on what I did try below. I would still definitely say to stop by if you're in the area but based on the wait, I personally was expecting a bit more.House Hash - 4/5 The egg, cook on the potatoes, short ribs, pickled veggies, and spinach was perfect! It was a homey portion of food and when it came to the table, my mouth was watering. When I took the first few bites, I had thought that the flavor was good but was missing a bit of pop. It could absolutely be a personal preference but I'd have loved more depth. Overall, still a good dish.My group also got the Big Spoon and Morning Bowl, see the photos attached!,I chanced upon Wooden Spoon during the midweek, in search of a hearty breakfast in a comfortable, warm setting.  Wooden Spoon dot the bill. The dining area is well appointed and comfortable, the service was great, and the Huevos Divorciados we absolutely delicious.  I'll keep the Wooden Spoon on my list of go to mid-week breakfast spots.,I got the huevos divorciados, but veganified. They don't really advertise this on their menu, but they offer vegan egg substitutes, which is amazing. I love brunch but there's always egg and I'm not a huge fan of the taste or smell. The food came out pretty fast and tasted really good. I felt a little rushed to leave though. The restaurant itself is pretty small and there's always a long line during brunch time on the weekends. I don't recommend coming here with a group larger than 3 people to be honest or else you'll be waiting a while to get seated during prime time. Overall, a 4/5. I got seated the second time I visited. Not the first because I came with a pretty large group (6 people) and the staff by the door turned us away even though they have one large table for large groups that just got taken.,Came at around 10:30 on a Sunday morning and there was no wait. Very cute vibes and good service. Good classic brunch spot with good vegetarian options. Two people got the crunch French toast and I got the vegetarian biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were nice and fluffy and liked the flavor of the mushroom gravy but wanted it to be more flavorful (I ended up adding hot sauce). Also thought the portion was pretty small and there could have been more gravy compared to the biscuit. But still would come again and def would love to try other things on the menu.,Visited here this past weekend for an early afternoon Sunday brunch at the recommendation of my friend. Glad we decided to stop here!  My friend and I both ordered a mimosa (it's Sunday, so why not?!) and the Big Spoon breakfast plate.  The Big Spoon ($19) was very filling and hearty, which included pancakes, toast, two eggs done in whatever style you want them, some bacon, toast, potatoes, and condiments (e.g. jam, syrup, and butter). I finished my entire meal and was stuffed to a very content level. Food was not only well presented but also tasty. Pleasantly surprised, there wasn't a wait when we arrived, as there was plenty of shared table & counter space for my friend and me! We went around 1:30PM (they close at 3PM), but I hear that there can be a wait if you go earlier in the day. So if you don't want to wait, I'd come here in their later opening hours. Parking is limited (e.g. street parking).,Decent brunch place. Came on a Sat and waited about 20-30 min for seats for three people. Bar & counter seating open up faster than tables. 5 stars for the Swedish pancakes - super light and delicious with the jam and lemon curd. 3.5 stars for the hash - it was good but could use some salt5 stars for service with a smileMy companions had the Benedict and soft scramble and said they were good but also not wildly outstanding. Will come back to try the breakfast sandwich!,Wooden Spoon has been on my brunch list for a while, and I'm happy to have finally tried this place recently! My friend and I came around 9:30am on a weekend, and didn't have to wait for a table. By the time we left close to 11am, there was quite a line outside. I ordered the Soft Scrambled Eggs, which was absolutely delicious! Portions here are definitely on the bigger side, and I found myself very full after the meal. My favorite part was the smoked salmon (super savory and smoky flavor!), as well as the crispy potatoes that were served alongside the dish. Overall, Wooden Spoon is a solid brunch place in SF that I'd definitely come back to in the future!,We came on Sunday around 1pm and they had open seats at the bar and counter, so we were seated at the counter right away. We got the banana pecan pancakes, house hash, and breakfast panini.The breakfast panini was my favorite! The scrambled eggs were soft and the ciabatta was really good and crispy on the outside. The house hash was more like short ribs from a stew than a breakfast hash. The banana pecan pancakes could have used more pieces of banana but they were fluffy and I liked them overall.,Arrived before 9am on Saturday and had maybe a 15-20 min wait - not too bad. We were seated at the bar facing the kitchen where you can see all of the food being prepped and cooked and the sanitation practices gave me pause. Many of the cooks and kitchen staff weren't wearing gloves. Some were wearing only one glove on one hand. One in particular was touching different utensils and skillets to cook, then turning around and grabbing handfuls of potatoes with his bare hands and putting them on plates to be served, not wiping or washing his hands in between! The food was cold. Ordered the biscuits and gravy. Gravy was delicious and hot but served over a cold and hard biscuit. My pancakes were cold. My bacon was cold. The system the cooks seemed to have was to make a lot of the items in batches ahead of time and then plate them as they're ordered. There was a large batch of potatoes that had already been cooked sitting over to the side and the same for the biscuits and bacon. When someone ordered a dish with one of those items, they'd grab from those patches and plate them so, a lot of the dishes aren't made to order in the first place. Then, the plates sit on the counter in the kitchen area before being placed on the upper counter for a server to bring them to their table and they're served lukewarm or cold. There's too long of a wait time between when the food is plated to when the food is brought to the table. Overall I thought the staff were nice but the service was slow. We had to flag someone down to ask for boxes and the check and guy who gave them to us seemed annoyed. When we left, there was a large crowd and a long wait time. I don't think the food is worth it.,Came for the food, come back weekly for the bartender. He makes the BEST drinks and has great suggestions. You can tell he wants people to love their drinks - and believe me we do. Ask him to go off menu and get something extra special! You won't regret it.,A nice cozy restaurant for brunch and no reservation, walk in only. The food unfortunately is not that memorable -- definitely not bad but not one I would recommend as a must have in SF when friends are visiting or go out of my way to come back.Both dishes were very typical American brunch food,Came here for a weekday lunch and had a good experience overall. The staff was friendly and checked on us often.Highly recommend the soft scramble - the dill crème sauce is BOMB. I was sad to hear that they don't serve it with crab anymore, but still delicious with smoked salmon.We also ordered the açaí bowl and granola crunch French toast. Açaí bowl surprisingly had more of a creamy yogurt texture and tasted more like Greek yogurt than açaí. French toast was average as well.,Located downtown Sf. This place offers normal breakfast and vegan options! We took some friends out for brunch and one friend was vegan so this place has best of both worlds.  It was pretty busy, service was average. Food was pretty good. Tasty pancakes :),I came in around 10:45 on a Sunday morning and was able to be seated almost immediately! I left around 12 and there were lots of people waiting outside around then, so definitely arrive earlier!We got the Big Spoon and the Huevos Divorciados - the Big Spoon was a huge portion size, good bang for your buck, and everything was pretty solid (all normal brunch food). The Huevos Divorciados were also not bad, but given that the Big Spoon was essentially the same price for way more food, I'd get that next time.,Overall delicious and would go again! A few caveats to consider: no reservations (although moved reasonably fast for smaller parties), pretty crowded and loud inside (could barely hear my partner from across the table) - probably not ideal for large groups, or if you're looking for a more intimate / chill spot.The food though is really tasty - share the Soft Scrambled Eggs with Salmon and Swedish Society Pancakes, as well as an order of toast which was the perfect portion for 2 people. The food came out super quickly and was piping hot which is always appreciated.Soft scrambled eggs had an amazing dill sauce on the eggs, and a nice honey mustard on the salad greens it came it. I really love that it comes with potatoes, greens, AND a bite of fruit - so nice to not have to decided between getting some nutrients and carby deliciousness.The Swedish Society pancakes were similarly tasty - enjoyed the lingonberry jam and the lemon curd was out of this world. The texture is a bit different from a traditional American pancake (more crepe like / similar to some Eastern European pancakes).,Visited a friend in town and he brought me to Wooden Spoon. Cute little restaurant in Dubose Triangle. I love that the walls are decorated with wooden spoons. We ordered a mimosa ($9) with fresh squeezed orange juice. For breakfast, I had the breakfast panini ($16). It was delicious. The eggs were really fluffy. I had some pancakes from my friends big spoon ($19) and they were great. I would definitely come back here again.,Came here for Sunday brunch around 11am and the wait was about 15-20 minutes for a table of three. I ordered the House Hash which had short ribs, potatoes, spinach, veggies, and a sunny side egg on top. The flavors mixed together very well. Great food and ambiance. Would recommend!,I AM MELTING! JUST LIKE THOSE SOFT SCRAMBLED EGGS! THEY ARE SO GOOD. Everything about them eggs and salmon and arugula (i mixed my arugula in with the eggs) is ~just~ RIGHT.  I DONT EVEN EAT ARUGULA because they don't suit my tastebuds, but THEY TASTED FINE WITH THEM EGGS! AKA: get the soft scrambled eggs (the potatoes on the side are just alright tho).i came here with a friend on a Sunday morning around 11 AM. There was a short wait, but definitely not too bad. However, when we were leaving (~12:30), the line DOUBLED. So make a reservation or go slightly earlier!!! But being crowded does not translate to bad services. The server came by many times to make sure everything was fine and our drinks are filled. The food also arrived at a reasonable speed. Lastly, the ambiance is just perfect for a cute sunday brunch. Full of natural lighting! Homey decor! and FLOWERS at every table! what's not to like about this place!!!,I got the the soft scrambled eggs along with the honey bee!The scrambled eggs with the smoked salmon was a great healthy brunch!Honey bee was on the sweeter side and didn't really taste much of alcohol. Would have preferred more gin in the drink,Super cute brunch spot in the Castro! Wait was as expected for a Sunday in the city. There's a paper waiting list and you just go up and put your name down, walk in only. Most of the tables inside are for 4 or less so not great for large groups, but my party of 5 was seated in less than 30 min (came at 11:30 on a Saturday). Service was ok, the hostess was very friendly, but our server was in and out only as needed. We had to flag down servers a couple times for water refills and additional condiments. The food on the other hand, was incredible. I had the banana pecan pancakes with a side of potatoes. The pancakes were so fluffy and the sauce was delicious. I'm a sucker for good breakfast potatoes and these didn't disappoint, super crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, the mustard seed crème fraiche was a nice addition. I also tried some of the short ribs from the house hash and it was so well cooked and tender. The best surprise was how many gluten free and vegetarian options there were! We came with a friend who needed this, and it was such a nice surprise that she had multiple options (the huevos divorciados has vegan chorizo!)Overall, lovely experience, super well decorated and all the wooden spoon decor on the wall was so cute!,The Swedish Society Pancakes are very interesting and flavorful. The soft scrambled eggs are decent and the Benedict is good but I don't try it. The drip coffee is just alright.,We dined here for Sunday brunch after waiting 45 minutes for a table. The drinks were quite good and service good but the food was just okay. The chef refused to put Swiss cheese on a burger even though it was available on the menu with the Reuben sandwich.,Amazing food, great service, and a unique menu make this breakfast spot a 5 star experience.Açaí Breakfast Bowl - 5 Stars. Absolutely delicious take on a healthy breakfast. The fruit was so fresh and the açaí so silky and good. Avocado Toast - 5 Stars. This basic dish was made special with balsamic and chili flakes served on perfectly toasted bread. Huevos Divorciados w Vegan Chorizo - 5 Stars. Packing a little heat, this egg dish was so tasty and seasoned perfectly with a delicious vegan chorizo.Service was friendly and consistent, our water glasses and coffee cup were never half empty. Solid spot!!,Delicious food and great vibes. Service was great. We had the short rib and the scrambled eggs. Cooked to perfection absolutely.,Such a cute brunch spot. There's a good amount of space inside Wooden Spoon and you have a variety of seating areas to choose from. On a Friday morning around 11am, it was a little busy, but not overly loud. The wait staff were attentive and kind. I tried the Avocado Toast and Granola Acai Bowl. While much smaller than I expected from other Yelper's photos, the Avocado Toast was delicious. Well balanced and the perfect amount of crunch to the toast. The Granola Acai Bowl was also tasty, the base was just a bit runnier than I would have preferred. The flavor was good though and the fruit on top was fresh and delicious. The ambiance of Wooden Spoon was modern-quaint and homey. I would recommend checking them out!,we were lucky to get a table without a wait at 11am on a weekend :) the place is gorgeous and the menu is quite unique. i enjoyed the place a lot but my bf was extremely disappointed - the avocado toast was tiny (maybe 2'' long) and no one warned him about the unusual size,I originally drafted this as a 4 star but after my second visit- the consistency of experience here makes it a 5.My go- to is their morning bowl. A vegetarian delight, brimming with roasted root vegetables, cauliflower, tahini and herby pesto grains. Add an egg or avo if you're extra hungry. It's healthy, it's got variety, it's delicious.Their espresso is also really solid. I ordered one on a whim and it was better than most places making coffee exclusively. Lastly, I just love LOVE dining at the kitchen counter here. Man, those cooks work fast! Such a hardworking team of chefs. For me, watching the behind the scenes operations is as engaging as an episode of Euphoria.,We arrived around 10 am. They had space available at a counter overlooking the kitchen. This was the best seat in the house. You could see people preping in the back part of the kitchen There was 3-4 line cooks making the plates. The hood and kitchen were super clean. It was like a dinner and a show. I had the breakfast panini and a side of potatoes. My wife had the avocado toast with a side of over easy eggs. My wife said her eggs were cooked perfectly the avocado toast came with picked red onions. She really like it. The side of potatoes were boiled new potatoes then fried for service. They came out hot and crispy on the outside with a tender warm middle. A mustard sauce accompanied the dish. The ciabatta panini was cheese ham and eggs. The bread was nicely toasted and the cheese was nice and melted. The dish had arugula on the side with a nice spicy salsa for the sandwich. Overall the food was good but unfortunately all the food didn't come out together. The potatoes arrived. Then after a few minutes the sandwich, and eggs. After about 15 minutes the avocado toast. Someone on the kitchen side needs to expedite or the food runner needs to make sure the ticket is complete before delivering the food.,The restaurant is on Market Street, and is quite spacious with deeper interior seating that you wouldn't expect upon initial glance. Ambiance: It's chic inside, without being under or overstated, clean with (not surprisingly), wooden spoons on the wall. Seating: There is bar seating in the front and table seating more as you go back into the restaurant.Food: We ordered the 1. HUEVOS DIVORCIADOS, which packed a lot of flavor, red sauce and green sauce with a vegan chorizo that well mimics meat; 2. MORNING BOWL, which lacked flavor but packed in the nutrients with fermented veggies, a well flavored dipping sauce, and a delicious pesto farro. Drink: mimosas, freshly squeezed orange and grapefruit juice, and more Lovely experience for brunch; though crowded at 10am until 11:30 on a Sunday, we could still talk and hear one another relatively well.,We wanted to stray from our usual Saturday morning breakfast at Art's Cafe. I've heard good things about Wooden Spoon and hubby has been before, so we gave it a try.It was fairly easy to get a table at around 8:45am. The menu has some interesting items. Of course the sweet options were enticing to my husband. He chose the french toast. I got the short rib hash.I wasn't super impressed with my dish, tbh. It was under-seasoned. So although the short ribs were fork tender, the entire dish needed salt and flavor.Service was very good.,Breakfast Panini: omg the server was totally right when she said it was a huge and filling sandwich. I split it with my friend and we still couldn't finish! Pretty good sandwich but a bit too heavy on the cheese Swedish Pancakes: absolutely delicious. This is the first place I've found in the city that serves Swedish pancakes! I normally have to drive out to Millbrae Pancake House when I crave Swedish pancakes. Grapefruit Juice: very refreshing but a rather small glass for its price.,Found another favorite brunch spot in the city! I stumbled across Wooden Spoon when trying to find an alternative to the super popular Kitchen Story just a few blocks down on Market, so my friend and I decided to give it a try. We arrived around 12:30pm on a Saturday, and the place was packed. I was a bit daunted by the number of people standing outside waiting, but the wait wasn't bad at all - around 10-15 mins with around 7 parties before us. We might have been lucky, so definitely make sure to arrive early if you have a larger party or are planning to visit at peak times (only walk-ins are accepted).The interior of the restaurant is simple but very pretty, and there is both table and bar seating. We somehow landed a spot right at the bar right in front of the chefs, which made for such a nice and unique brunch experience. As for the food, my friend and I both opted for savory over sweet - my friend got the Market St. Benedict and I got the Soft Scrambled Eggs. The scrambled eggs were super soft and creamy, pairing well with the smoked salmon (which was a little salty for my taste). The sides were also amazing - the potatoes and fruit were solid, but the arugula was the true standout! As someone who strongly dislikes arugula, I was able to clean my plate because the dressing was just that good. The portion size was also perfect (and good for the price!!), leaving me feeling satisfied but not overly full. Will definitely be back to try some of their other items like the Swedish Society Pancakes! High quality food + service + ambiance = 5 stars from me :),So glad we decided to try this place for breakfast. We went around 9:15 on a Saturday and were able to put our names on the list and only wait a few minutes before being seated. I was happy to find out they can swap out just egg and make a lot of their menu vegan. They also have a cashew cream (although it's a little runny). They have oat and almond milk as well for lattes.I really appreciate the vegan options and both were delicious! The potatoes were super crunchy. My only complaint is it's a little pricey, but that's pretty common for the city so I get it. Would love to stop in here again for breakfast. It's super cute inside as well and servers are nice!,Pretty lovely brunch spot with lots of seating. Got the hash with short ribs and the Swedish pancakes. The Swedish one was nice and light, really enjoyed the lemon curd. The hash was very filling and tasty, wish the beef was a bit more tender but was still tasty.,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 4/5Overall: Standard fare for my taste buds.The extended review...Food: Swedish Pancakes - 3/5 - Although there aren't many places in the city where you can find this on the menu but in comparison to my typical go to it falls a little short for texture and flavor.Chicken Apple Sausage - 3/5 - Pretty standard fare.Service: 3/5 - Standard service.Ambiance: 4/5 - A cute place that fits well into the neighborhood.,I tend to get the same thing because it's always incredible and it hits the spot. I always get the morning bowl- a Buddha bowl essentially. Each veg is prepared differently, yummy. We celebrated a birthday once, and they kindly prepared a birthday pancake for the bday girl.The servers and staff are very friendly and accommodating. The decore is cute. The bar is inviting (and they do have great cocktails). It's a great place.,Used to be my favorite brunch in all of SF. See my first review over 4 years ago.Last week when I was there they let a dog in, and there is no outdoor patio. Dogs who are not service animals are not allowed in indoor dining spaces. This is California law. This particular dog was on the owner's lap, shaking fur and dander everywhere and sneezing...in a place where food is prepped and consumed. The next table over, one poor diner hadn't even touched her drink and abandoned it because it was in the line of fire of the dog's sneeze.This ain't cool, WS. I like dogs but they don't belong in indoor dining spaces. Food is still good but service has gone down as well. The crab in the soft scrambled eggs has been downgraded to smoked salmon, and they got rid of the blue green smoothie bowl. Drinks are also meh now. There are so many other options in SF. I was faithfully waiting for WS to reopen after 2020/2021, but don't find myself enthusiastic to dine here any more.,This place always has a crazy line on the weekends. Went on a holiday Monday morning about an hour after opening, no lines but filled up fast when we left. No outdoor seating but interior has a variety of bar seating, tall and short tables, booths fit for various party sizes. Got the huevos divorciados, I specifically asked for scrambled eggs but they came sunny side up. I ate them one at a time but should have alternated since they had different fillings - one had the housemade vegan chorizo and the other is layered with guac. Still good though, just the right amount of food. Staff was friendly.,Wow, I was really impressed with how yummy their food is. I got the Huevos Diverciados and have been reminiscing about how they good they were ever since. The vegan chorizo was incredible. My bf had the avocado toast and my friend the House Hash. We were all very satisfied with our choices. I was not sure how kid friendly it'd be but it was",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actually a good experience with an 8 year old. They do not have a kid's menu but they do have pancakes so its not really an issue as you can guess :) They also made a yummy chocolate milk for him, very cool. So so happy our friend recommended this place for a Sunday brunch spot. Wait time was very reasonable for SF brunch. Service was smooth, friendly and fast.,If you're looking to add more brunch spots to your rotation, then consider checking this place out ~My partner and I went on a Saturday morning around 8:30ish. There was ample metered street parking at the time, but I can imagine parking can get tough later on since it's on Market. We were seated immediately upon arrival. Wooden Spoon gives classy cozy vibes. Feels homey but v polished. We started the day with Golden Delicious, which def was a delicious pineapple whiskey.If you want a hardy breakfast, I'd recommend the House Hash. I've had it twice and loved eating it each time. It had short rib, crispy potatoes, spinach and mustard cream, topped with a beautiful sunny egg. So savory and satisfying.My partner got the Soft scrambled eggs. I thought the smoked salmon well nicely with the eggs. Pancakes is a must wherever we brunch and the Banana Pecan pancakes here were delightful. Soft, fluffy pancakes dressed with this praline sauce that had the perfect amount of sweetness.Service was great, attentive, and anticipatory.Thoroughly enjoyed my time at Wooden Spoon and I'll be returning soon!,Delicious food, especially the Vegas sausage patties! Quick and friendly service, street paid parking, and wait for seating did not take long.,One of my favorite brunch places in SF that never disappoints! We got there around 9am and were seated right away, it does get quite busy so I recommend going as early as you can to avoid waiting - though the wait would be worth it. My boyfriend and I decided to order a savory and sweet dish to share. We had the huevos divorciados which we really liked as you get one with green salsa and avocado and another with red salsa and vegan chorizo - I really love that they do this! The Swedish pancakes were superb, I thoroughly enjoy how light they are and the sauces they come with are a combo of sweet and tart. The only downside to this place is that I can't figure out how to try more dishes since I keep coming back for these 2 ;-),The hash at he Wooden Spoon is excellent. One of the best meals I've had in awhile.  A great combination of tender short rib, potatoes, spinach, and a mustard cream. Simple but outstanding. Very easy 5 stars.,Delicious, light, perfect brunch spot. I kid you not, when my brunch date and I came here for the first time, we forgot to chat for 10 minutes since we were so absorbed in how good our food was.The wait is a bit long when you arrive, but after you get seated, orders are quickly placed and delivered. Service is quick and attentive. The only time we waited was to get seated.The interior ambiance is filled with natural light and homey decor, with flowers on every table. Cute!I think this was my favorite eggs benedict out of all the brunch spots I've tried so far. So light and creamy, perfectly poached to slowly ooze over the English muffin, which was toasted to perfection to hold the yolk.The salad is lightly dressed and a great complement to the richness of the hollandaise sauce. The fruit salad is tart and sweet and very refreshing. The potatoes were crisply on the outside, fluffy on the outside. Perfection.The mimosa was bubbly and sweet, and refreshing. I really appreciate how light yet flavorful the food is here. You leave feeling full and satisfied, but not heavy.I would definitely return and recommend!,Great brunch spot!! We got there around 10:30 on a Saturday morning and the wait was not bad. I've heard it gets very busy though. The atmosphere inside is cute, open and light. Service is quick and friendly. I got the breakfast spritz (Aperol and champagne) and it was delicious and strong. I got the little spoon breakfast for my meal and it was plenty of food and yummy! A lovely weekend brunch spot for sure, def check it out.,Fantastic Swedish Pancakes and humane local meats, which is huge for me! Excellent bottomless coffee and I had fun with the staff while I was there. It's pretty new, so show them some love and grab some tasty Northern European influenced food.,My favorite spot for a quiet weekday breakfast! The food is simple but really good! The Little and Big spoon plates are filling and hearty meals. Their chicken apple sausage are the best I've had. One of these days I'll try the house hash which looks mouthwatering. This restaurant is completely different on the weekends than weekdays. The weekdays are quiet and really serene while the weekends are jam packed and lively. Take your pick but it'll be a good breakfast/brunch no matter what.,First time visiting Wooden Spoon and I absolutely loved it. The environment is very inviting and casual. Perfect spot for a Sunday brunch. Great tasting food, amazing presentation and phenomenal customer service provided by all the staff. I would definitely come back again and recommend to all my friends and family. The House made Vegan chorizo was bursting with flavor while at the same time being the perfect consistency. I suspect the chorizo was marinated with some type of dried chili pepper, maybe guajillo?,VEGAN REVIEW:They have a lot of vegetarian options but only one substantial brekky that can be made vegan. I had the Morning Bowl veganized with vegan chorizo. Make sure to order it vegan if you are eating vegan, otherwise it is just vegetarian. I'm not too picky as a vegan. I know that appears ironic, but if it's vegan," I'll eat it. The Morning Bowl was good and is a very """"clean"""" meal by itself", meaning it digested easily and didn't make me feel heavy after eating it, but I definitely recommend adding the veg chorizo for something more filling and hearty. The flavors were great and I appreciated having a vegan option that wasn't just a fruit bowl or oatmeal.,It's the way I literally cannot stop thinking about the Morning Bowl I had here. Best brunch item I've ever ordered, it was so delicious and loaded with veggies. I'm going to have to go back sometime because I loved it. We waited pretty long for a table but there was 5 of us and it was a busy Saturday morning, so understandable. The waitress was super sweet, she came out to check on us a few times and let us know that she was just waiting for a table to finish up so she could get us seated.,I came here for brunch on Saturday since I am always looking for a new good spot for brunch.  I ordered the Swedish pancakes and latte and my friends ordered the chicken sandwich and the soft scrambled eggs entree.  The Swedish pancakes were mildly flavored just by themselves but flavorful with the jam and lemon curd sauce that they came with.  My friend really liked the chicken sandwich and the focaccia bread on that sandwich smelled and looked great too!  I tried the soft scrambled eggs, they were great! 4 stars for good food, I expected a little more flavor profile and texture on those pancakes! I will come back to try out more dishes for sure.,Wooden Spoon is mine and my fiance's new favorite brunch place! We came at around 1pm on a Saturday and there was no wait--PHEW! We also got the BEST seat in the house, on the counter overlooking three chefs cooking. Seriously," watching them made me appreciate dining at a restaurant so much more. They work hard to cook the food well AND plate well (all the food is super photogenic). We were entranced the whole time just watching them. And we could see all the dishes we want to try on our next visit!We started with a complimentary sparkling lemonade (thank you to our kind waitress for that!! I'm sad I didn't get her name). I ordered the granola acai bowl and my mans ordered the big spoon. My """"acai"""" bowl was great", but for some reason I thought it was an acai bowl, I guess I didn't read the menu carefully enough to figure out that it's actually an acai flavored yogurt bowl! It was also presented really beautifully. My fiance enjoyed his big spoon plate and we ended up sharing a lot of it--the potatoes were absolutely delicious!!We want to come back to try more food and fingers crossed, will get the same table as last time!,Wow!!! What a hidden gem!! I come to the Castro several times a year from NOLA and always stay a block away at Beck's. Never really noticed this place before. No big street sign and it blends in with the building. Heard someone praising it on a morning walk and decided to check it out. So glad I did!!!EXCELLENT breakfast spot! Charming, quaint restaurant with a lovely and friendly staff. I had the Big Spoon breakfast and it was terrific!! It's like a basic breakfast at most spots, but yummier!!! The potatoes were amazing!!!! Highly recommend for breakfast lovers!!!,Absolutely delicious breakfast. So fresh and tasty. Servers were fabulous and attention to detail was all there. Coffee and French-press also nice,I've been meaning to check this place out for sometime and it's conveniently located on the main street with easy access o transportation and walking distance for coffee shops. It's a solid brunch spot with a small selected menu -- my friend I both ordered the Market St Benedict and loved it. The potatoes were crisp to perfect and the eggs were nice and runny on top of the toasted muffins. The place can be busy even for a weekday but they have a good amount of seating in the main room besides the bar counter.,If I could give 6/5 stars, I totally would. I think I just found my newest favorite brunch spot in San Francisco...Wooden Spoon looks like a hole-in-the-wall join along Market Street, but inside, the restaurant has a really cozy and intimate charm. Seating is surprisingly spacious, and when my brother and I went, we chose to sit right in front of the kitchen area, where we could see the chefs prepare all the delicious food. While my brother got the Big Spoon (with eggs, potatoes, bacon, and pancakes), I ordered the soft scrambled eggs (which come with smoked salmon, mixed greens, and potatoes). Holy shit, the food was incredibly delicious! I used to have very high regard for Zazie, which is also another favorite of mine. However, I felt that Wooden Spoon even surpassed Zazie! The potatoes were crisp and freshly fried. The soft scrambled eggs were insanely creamy. Even my brother had nothing but good things to say about his meal. All in all, I highly recommend Wooden Spoon for breakfast/brunch. Another reason why the Castro district is becoming my go-to neighborhood to visit!,Went for brunch.    Super nice friendly staff.  Good menu selection.   I had the bacon eggs toast and pancakes.    The food was mediocre for the price.  It's bacon and eggs. It can't be amaZing. Ever.   Bacon and eggs is the same whether you make it at home, get it at Dennys, or pay three times too much for it in the city.  The pancakes weren't good.   Dry and thick.   The food was not served hot.   The drinks were very good. Noisy and cramped. The potato's were good but served lukewarm. Hot food should be served hot not lukewarm. I'm baffled as to  why we are waiting 45 minutes in line for this.,If you are looking for a breakfast place in San Francisco that is not pricey, where you can have a tasty breakfast for less than 20$ a plate, I would highly recommend Wooden Spoon. I had the Huevos Divorciados, and my girlfriend tried the Swedish Pancakes. This was the perfect combination of sweet and savory. The Huevos Divorciados come with two eggs; one in green salsa, and another in red salsa, the egg in green salsa is topped with two crispy tortillas with fresh avocado, while the one in red also has two crispy tortillas with vegan chorizo. The eggs are split with beans and crema. I would highly recommend this dish. The swedish pancakes are also a must if you want to try something unique to Wooden Spoon, as it comes with a lingonberry jam and lemon cream. When we arrived by 9 am, there was no wait, and service was adequate. Definitely would go again!,There was a Long wait to be seated and for orders to be taken at times we felt like we had no waiter!!  We also notice Other tables got helped before we did and they also got their food first. I felt like I had to basically chase the waiter if I needed something. The $7 ice coffee tasted burned or bitter and was I was outrageously disappointed at one of the cooks!!! while preparing food!!! Bad idea to sit at the bar where you can see everything!! At first it was cool because we got to see all the food! But then I saw A cook scratching his back and then goes to handle food without washing his hands. You may be wondering why didn't we leave well we were starving and had already waited to be seated, to be helped, and to be served food.,I was pretty impressed with the Wooden Spoon. Upon entering, I was greeted by a friendly staff member who kindly checked my vaccination card and helped me get seated. The food is exceptional and reasonably-priced. The reason I am giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the service was a little poor. The servers were not friendly (did not even offer a greeting) and only came by ONCE after taking my order. I ordered drip coffee (which was rather expensive), and they only came by one time to refill my coffee, which was LONG past due. The kitchen staff is really impressive, however, providing delicious food with excellent presentation in a timely manner. I will be back to the Wooden Spoon to try out more of their dishes--and hoping that the service will be better next time.,Food: mediocre.The biscuits were dried out and hard, one piece flew across the table attempting to cut into it. The portions were tiny, literally two small biscuits total. The gravy was decent.The heuvos divorciados we're ok, but once again portions were tiny. They skimped on the veggie chorizo, and no sides of beans or veggies at all.The avocado toast we ordered as we were still hungry, and it was a strong lemon flavor with pickled onions. I'm not sure I like it, but it was at least good for what it was supposed to be.Price: $$," 5% """"mandates"""" aka ownership being weak. $72 for two people with coffee. Overpriced considering the portions.",I came here for breakfast with my family since we were in the area and I'm so glad I went.We came in pretty early, so it was quite empty & this place is spacious. The server helping us was super nice and helpful as well.I ended up ordering the Swedish society pancakes along with a side of their potatoes and a drip coffee. The pancakes were amazing! The lemon curd and lingonberry jam work well together and create a nice flavor. The coffee was great too as they use beans from Sightglass and I was thankful for the server that would refill my coffee cup whenever they came around. The potatoes were so good, I got them extra crisply and wow that was the right decision.I'll definitely be back here again whenever I'm around!,A great accident we came upon. We had originally planned to go to Kitchen story down the street, but turned out they were closed for machine issues, so we went over to Wooden Spoon instead. I was definitely disappointed Kitchen Story was closed, but so don't regret choosing to come here as a backup. This place was so cute on the inside and there's was no wait at 10am. The food was SUPER good, I had the Big Spoon plate and this was so much food. The only down side was no bottomless mimosas, as that is what I look for in brunch, but wasn't a deal breaker. From service, to food, to ambiance, this will not be a backup anymore. This place will be a staple for me to take family when they visit. Thank you Wooden Spoon!,Great restaurant. Had breakfast and had many choices to choose from. I was just hungry for the traditional breakfast of eggs, ham and grits. All were very good and fresh.,Great service, great food! I had the Swedish society pancakes with lemon curd and loganberry jam. Perfect amount of sweet/tart balanced with the Swedish pancakes. Husband had the eggs Benedict and loved them. Not drenched in hollandaise but enough for great flavor. Highly recommend !,This place was a great find! Had the Huevos Divorciados it came with2 sunny side up eggs I opted for the chicken sausage instead of the Vegan Chorizo and it was wonderful!!it also came with avocado , queso Fresco and black beans!! What a wonderful breakfast served by Charles and Cuba thank you will definitely be back!!,French Toast good.Vegan chorizo good.Good ambience. Good service. Good location!!!,This food was delicious, I highly recommend this place. The panini was to die for. If you are in the area, so stop by!,Wooden Spoon is a lovely SF brunch spot, and is an especially convenient location for those who want to explore small shops nearby in the city after their meal. My friends and I walked into this restaurant on a Wednesday afternoon (a little before 10:30 AM) and were giving three options: sit at the bar top counter area, share a table with another party, or wait for 15 minutes. After being seated at our own table following a 10-15 minute wait, where we used the meantime to peruse the menu, we ordered the Little Spoon, the Swedish pancakes, and the avocado toast. The Little Spoon -- a dish consisting of roasted potatoes, eggs with salmon, salad, and a small side of berries -- was most enjoyable for me entirely because of the potatoes. They were extremely well done -- crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I would have preferred the Swedish pancakes to be a little less moist and for the lemon curd they came with to be a little less tangy and a little more sweet. I would get the Swedish pancakes again, though, because their overall taste was good and they were plentiful, coming in threes with two sweet and tangy jam/sauce compliments. If there is one dish I can't recommend, it is the avocado toast. It had a very lemony flavor to it, and the juice touching it from the pickled onions on the side didn't help. The avocado wasn't soft either, and the best part of this dish was the bread itself -- generous, thick, and slightly crunch. Overall, 3 stars for good service and mostly good, moderately inexpensive meal.,Can't go wrong dining here. Great ambiance and menu. The Bloody Mary was perfectly made. The banana pecan pancake was moist and delicious. I highly recommend the fried chicken sandwich, the chicken wasn't dry, it was battered nicely on a focaccia bread. Also the superfood salad very refreshing.,Currently staying at an air bnb right above the Flore Dispensary with Uber being my only way of transportation if you're in the area and are looking for a filling meal Wooden Spoon has a few different options. Got the big spoon to try a little bit of everything and the frenar toast to try their whipped cream  It was all very delicious,This is a cool small restaurant that I love going to. The food is delicious and it's such good vibe. I typically get the Little Spoon plate which is  btw... and it's reasonably priced. I would recommend this place if you are a breakfast person.,I ordered the soft scrambled eggs (featuring smoked salmon, mascarpone, dill crème fraiche greens, fruit, and potatoes). the scrambled eggs were sooo tender, milky, and fluffy! probably the biggest highlight of the meal. other items were delicious as well -- the fruits were super sweet and juicy and the greens were seasoned just right (I adored the dressing). I loved the potatoes as well! I would definitely go back and try their other dishes :),After spending the night in SF, I walked over to this establishment for a breakfast, hearing great things about this place. When I walked in, I was instantly welcomed by Luke the bartender, Bunny the host as well as the other patrons. I ordered the house hash, which had short ribs and potatoes and was absolutely delicious. I also got myself a green tea and since Luke was making fresh squeezed orange juice, I had to get myself a glass of it as well. Overall, it was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had, like top 5, and the staff were all just awesome, especially Luke and Bunny. I will be back at some point in the future!,Get there early and not a weekend if you are trying to eat at a decent waiting time! Location is right on market street close to Castro so expect to loop around a few times to find parking. Even then, on weekends there's a line out the door of people waiting to get seated. The place in a good size (no outdoor seating), but it gets really crowded. Food was really good, that I have toGive credit, got the chicken sandwich since we took a while to be seated, we decided on the lunch menu instead of brunch. Do not get the iced coffee. It is bitter. It was more of drip coffee over iced, and it was not good, so changed it for iced tea instead. Since it's super busy, expect your server to only check on you once. It was hard to call them for extra sauces or utensils/plates, etc. so practically the servers were not very attentive for our needs. One good point is the for the hostess who was very nice and kept us in the looop about our table even if it took about an hour and a half to be seated. Too busy, if you can find anyone brunch spot, go there instead.,Came here for brunch on a Sunday and the line was pretty long. We waited around 30 mins to be seated when we came around 11-11:30am. Big spoon: came with biscuits, bacon, 2 pancakes, potatoes, fruits, and eggs. My favorite part had to be the biscuits. They were super buttery and fluffy! I also liked the potatoes - seemed like they were double fried so the outside was crispy but the inside was still fluffy!House hash: the beef on its own wasn't super flavorful but it was tender. The sauce accompanying was creamy and a little tangy. I didn't like the pickled veggies that much - it was too sour and just tasted like eating straight vinegar. Portions were decent and prices were around what I'd expect for a brunch place in SF (each was around $17-18 before tax).,Food is amazing!  Gets busy quickly even during the week.  Hash is a favorite.  Pancake is also not to miss.,Found the dishes under-seasoned. Didn't make me wanna come back again for the food. I might try this again only if I'm somewhere in the neighborhood.,We were almost deterred by the line but I am so glad that we stayed put! This restaurant is beautiful--especially the countertops throughout. We were lucky enough to sit at the bar overlooking the kitchen. It was so much fun to watch. Almost everything that we saw them make had us questioning our orders because everything looked phenomenal. My eggs Benedict was excellent--acidic and creamy. The potatoes were crispy and delicious. The biscuit tasted homemade and was fluffy and buttery. I also loved the arugula salad that came with my dish. All in all, I was very impressed and will absolutely be back! I've found my new staple breakfast spot.,Food was very delicious and the lady up front was supper hospitable and nice. Nice sitting area and very rustic feeling but clean.,Great all around brunch spot with a good amount of sweet and savoury options on the menu. A number of the brunch cocktails look good too although I didn't try one. The breakfast sandwich was quite large and came with a really good hot sauce. No outdoor seating but the space is super cute.,Fantastic brunch spot!  Classics, and creative spins on the classics.  Drinks are fun, coffee is okay (and you may have to ask for a refill on a busy day).,The food was amazing, the staff was super friendly and the drinks were great. I ordered the big spoon with a biscuit and I went crazy for it. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the pancakes were super fluffy. The bacon was amazing and the potatoes were great. There coffee was the only thing needing improvement but it's a breakfast joint, not a coffee bar.These guys have some of the best food in the Bay Area. Definitely check these guys out!,The Big Spoon portion is a bit too much and soft scramble eggs is just enough. Nice place to eat, great service, but requires around 30 minutes wait time on a Saturday morning,Love this place! Really enjoyed my morning bowl which I requested with chicken and they were happy to accommodate. The bowl consisted of high quality healthy and fresh ingredients such as farro, asparagus, squashes, arugula, etc. My boyfriends tuna melt sandwich was also flavorful and the bread was toasted to perfection. Especially liked that all the sauces for my bowl were on the side. We also ordered mimosas which were superb! My only comment would be that the restaurant was rather loud. There was a large boisterous group behind us with explosions of laughter and loud conversations. The acoustics of the room made the cacophony unbearable and was difficult to converse. The service was exceptional. Really appreciated all the waiters - very sweet and friendly. I will be back, but maybe take the bar seats next time instead of the loud dining room.,"Excellent breakfast!  This is the second time we have been to the Wooden Spoon.  I would highly recommend eating there.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hu Tong Jian Bing,"Hu Tong Jian Bing is a pop-up located inside of Happy Cow Creamery & Tea. There's currently a table blocking off the entry so you can't actually go inside, but they'll take your order from across the table. There are a total of 6 different meat filling options for the jian bing, as well as an ""original"" option that contains no meat. All of the jian bing include some standard but customizable fillings: a crispy wonton wrapper, green onion, cilantro, and sauce.It wasn't very crowded when we ordered so the crepes were prepared pretty quickly, probably less than 10 minutes or so. I would definitely recommend eating them while they're warm and fresh so that the crispy wonton maintains it's crunch.We opted for the braised pork and roasted duck flavors, and both were very delicious. The braised pork had a stronger flavor than the duck, and the duck tasted like duck (I like duck). The highlight for me was definitely the crispy wonton and the sauce so I would probably just go for the original option next time, but I don't think you can really go too wrong with any of the meat options either.,So I love eating Jian Bing when I was back in China, and always try it whenever I find it in the US. Even though I was full from lunch, I had to come to this place to see how it was. The place is inside of the Happy Cow Creamery. Seems like an add-on to the boba place's menu. I got the Original, the taste is actually pretty authentic, sort of like the street food in Beijing. I had low expectations since most Jian Bing places in US are pretty bad. I was pleasantly surprised. At $10, it's like 7 times the cost than in China but it's Silicon Valley so what can you do.  If I lived closer, I'd probably come here every day.,3.5 stars rounded up to 4!The jiang bing is tasty and they give a good amount! Comes cut in half in two slices. We got spicy lamb and beef stew. The sauce is good but it does get tiring after a while for me. The way it is packaged, I feel like the flour gets soggy really fast and easily. The drinks are ok. Mango sago was good but tasted like a regular mango drink with no coconut flavor shining through. H2O (oolong with sea salt cream and oreo) was watered down. I ordered it without the oreo. Sea salt did not have any flavor. I would come back to try the roasted duck jiang bing and the ice cream. They make your order pretty fast. No indoor seating. There was a steady amount of people ordering and waiting for their orders outside the place but it might be because there was an event at Chase Center that day.,Came here on a Sunday around 5pm. I got the cumin lamb and roast duck jian bing.They both could have used more salt or seasoning since it was a bit bland. The meat itself was nicely seasoned. The crepe had little flavor. The duck was not crispy, and it was pretty hard to bite through. The lamb was delicious. It is a pretty big portion, and they do cut them in half for you. It took about 10-15 minutes for them to make it, and there's a grass area/open space nearby for you to walk or go on a picnic.,Saw the posters outside of this boba shop and was so excited to get a jian bing, which I feel like is pretty rare to find in the city. The order was complete pretty fast, so I was pleasantly surprised by that. You can select if you want extra green onions, so of course I opted in! The jian bing itself was kinda pricy for what i got, but it did have two pieces. Overall, the flavor didn't really stand out in any way, but still fun to try. If this is something you've been wanting to try, I'd say go for it, but I probably wont be back.,**Review is from pre-covid (March 2020), just cleaning up my drafts and posting them**Loved my roast duck jian bing from this pop up at Happy Cow. I stopped by with a couple of friends Sunday at 5 pm to grab dinner and catch up. I appreciated that you can also get boba or rolled ice cream from Happy Cow, so there's something for everyone if not everyone in your group wants a jian bing.I went with the roast duck jian bing ($12) with no spice, no green onion, and no cilantro. I love that this can all be customized as part of your order, as I'm pretty picky with the spice level and ingredients.The actual jian bing was delicious. There was plenty of roast duck, and they put something inside that gives it a wonderful crisp to every bite.I've had a couple of jian bing in the states in different cities, but this is my favorite spot so far!,Very tasty Jian Bing, brought me back to childhood right away. The perfect time to get this is a cold winter morning, or afternoon, when it's a little cold, a little windy, a little gray. It's just comforts you and makes you feel everything will be ok. They use good ingredients such as duck, fried tofu. I haven't had Jian Bing in a long time so I'm not really sure if it would be called ""authentic"" but hey why does it matter if it's yummy?,This was an impulse buy cause I don't see Jian Bing sold often, so I was very excited. While it came out super hot and fresh, it wasn't as good as I hoped. The texture wasn't as chewy as I thought it would be, but the flavor itself was pretty good. Next time I'd try it with the duck after seeing all the rave reviews!,If you've ever had authentic Jian Bing in the streets of Beijing, China you know this doesn't compare. I've tried their other pop-ups around the bay area and they are pretty much the same. This pop up is inside Happy Cow, known for their rolled ice cream and boba drinks. I usually get the original jian bing but this time got one with duck and one with braised pork. I was expecting shredded pork but instead got ground pork. I felt the ingredients were not spread out evenly. Careful as it is very hot when it's handed to you. But the time it cooled down enough to eat, the crispy cracker was soggy. There is a bit of spicyiness in some parts so heads up. It took just 7 minutes to prepare both jian bings so that was fast. Overall it's an okay snack.,I had the roast duck jian bing and it was tasty. They have a decent amount of duck and ingredients . Will return.,Nasty. Got the curry chicken jian bing and it was... weird? Gave it a second try with roasted duck... Still nasty. It was a salty soggy mess. Threw both of them  away.,I had my first jian bing on the streets of Beijing in 2008.  I can't remember exactly what was on it, but I remember really liking it.  So I'm happy to see jian bing popping up on the street food circuit here in San Francisco.  Their preparation is pretty good.  I also appreciate how they have a lot of meat add-on options.Roasted Duck Jian Bing: Made fresh to order.  You can customize the scallion, cilantro and spiciness level; I went with the default.  However, extra of everything would probably be nice too.  It wasn't necessarily bland, but even more would be nice.  The crispy wonton inside the soft egg / crêpe exterior was a great texture contrast.  Really liked the roasted duck filling option.  It was more like soft pulled duck confit than the firmer duck you'd see in windows in Chinatown.  I did bite into a little bone shard, so be mindful when eating this, especially with the expected crunch from the fried wonton.,They need to update yelp and their signage because it said they are open from 11-7pm on Sunday. We waited from 11 until 11:20, even called them, someone over phone said it should be open and he was not very helpful. As we were waiting, a few others also drop by and left. Before you go, just call.,My first time having jianbing and I really enjoyed it! Best eaten freshly made for sure and it's super filling! Enough to share with another person if you're looking for a snack! The crepe was perfectly cooked and really flavorful! With a bit of a kick if you like spice! I got mine with roasted duck! I love that fried cracker in between! Adds such nice flavor and texture! I'm a fan! And for $12 it's a pretty good deal for that amount!,I had no clue this place was located inside of SF Happy Cow Creamery and Tea!  Apparently they partner with cafes, boba shops, etc. Came for lunch one day, and I was so pleasantly surprised I had to get one along with the boba for my girlfriend.  It's a savory fried pancake made with different meats and toppings.My friend recommended to me the Beef Stew version with extra spicy + extra green onions which adds a lot of flavor without too much spice.  Meant to eat only half of it...but ended up scarfing down the whole thing it was that amazing.,Excited to find Jian Bing in the city! I thought the curry chicken was much better than the duck. If they offered the crispy style in addition to the Beijing steamed crepe style. I think it would have been a 5 star for me. Def coming back again.,Little pop up shop inside Foam Tea House. Wait time not nearly as long as the one located in San Mateo. You can get your boba fix along with your jian bing order. ;) I ordered the roasted duck ($12), as said to be the top seller. Inside was packed with roasted duck, fried wonton, bean sauce, sesame seeds, egg, green onions, cilantro. Not going to taste good if you leave it sitting out. Eat it right away. Tastes the best when it's piping hot. Wait time: 10 mins (for jian bing) Flavor: 4/5 Overall: 3/5 stars,Love that this is an addition to the Dogpatch area! I remember when this first came to SF I waited 30 min in line at a SPARK food festival to get my hands on one. So nice to walk in and order in an actual brick and mortar joint! This isn't like the traditional ones I've had in China but they're still tasty! The only downsides are as others have mentioned:1. The sauce isn't as spicy as flavorful as I had hoped. Even with the addition of the $1 picked veggie it still lacked a kick. I'm going to order extra spicy with extra sauce next time.2. The outside was a bit undercooked and doughy. Still good but it wasn't as well done as it could be. Still going to frequent this joint though.,I got the roast duck jian bing and the mango sago. Both were really good and reminded me of authentic jian bing!,Happy Cow Creamery & Tea is an Asian dessert spot in the Dogpatch. I've recently just noticed it and was surprised to find out that they house a permanent popup inside that serves jianbing, one of my favorite Chinese street foods.I haven't had the boba or ice cream here, but I have had their jianbing from Hutong Jianbing inside the restaurant. It looks like there's a permanent popup in here that serves Beijing style Jianbing for $10 each. There's several toppings to choose from including plain, chicken, curry chicken, duck, and beef.The jianbing here is made to order. It's actually a bit different than what I'm sued to from what I've tried in Shanghai. There's less egg, the youtiao is replaced with some other type of fried dough, and no pickled vegetables. However, what you get is still solid and one of the only places I know of in the Bay Area to get jianbing! What a great hidden surprise.,Very delicious Chinese crepes, bringing back so many memories about childhood. They come with a kick, so order less spicy if you're like me and cannot take too much spice at once. I like to call in ahead of time when I'm on my way for pick up. It takes a few minutes for them to make the crepes. Very friendly staff, helpful and warm.,Look past the front door of Happy Cow Creamy  & Tea, there is magic folded in the Chinese crepesOne veggie, spicy, was inexpensive and Delicious!Worth a visit  .... with ice  cream for dessert of course,Friendly hosts, and tasty Jian Bing! Wish that pork jian bing is with pork belly not grounded pork, but the flavor is really good.,I've been to this restaurant multiple times now and it never disappoints. Definitely hits the spot when I'm craving Chinese street food, and the portions are super generous!,Good jian bing, but personally I prefer the crispy kinds. Didn't quite satisfy me. Taste was decent and it was okay for a Beijing style.,I enjoyed the original and the roast duck Jianbing! My family was hoping for more sauce on the side. I'll definitely come back again! Great service. The workers follow the 6 ft rule. They wiped down the credit card screen and have a bottle of hand sanitizer out for you to use.,Came here with my baby girl for her first ever salty crepe and both of us LOVE it! We ordered the duck JianBing and oh my oh! Can you image a combo of a chewy soft skin and a crispy sheet with this super flavorful sauces and juicy pulled duck meats!!! Would highly recommend this boba and jianbing to everyone!,This was pretty average compared to the amazing ones from China. Overall, it is tasty but just lacked textures and flavors to be in the next dimension. For example, the crepe lacked chew and the fillings were a bit dull. Solid choice nonetheless for an authentic dish but don't expect magic.,I was quite excited when I learned this is gonna be in my neighborhood. I tried the roasted duck fried pancake and it did not disappoint! The portion was huge (it comes in 2 servings) and the price was very affordable. I'm so glad when I find out this is not just a pop-up and the boba place will continue to serve them. Can't wait to come back and try out a different one next time!,My weekend jian bing go-to! Love the roast duck flavor the most, but my husband and I always have to eat it in the car or else it gets soggy by the time we get home since so much condensation builds within the wax paper bag. If eaten immediately off the crepe maker, the jian bing's interior is perfectly crispy!,I love jian bing. It's one of the many Chinese food I missed the most. Stoped by this place to try it. I'd say it's ok but not as good or authentic as the real one in China. The soy paste inside tasted weird. Their customer service was alright.,It wasn't hard to find the place- just make sure to confirm with the staff if you are unsure. We ordered the curry chicken, pork and a regular bing. There was no one at the place so the food was made fresh and came out quickly. The food was okay- wish it was a bit more crispy and and more spicy(we ordered the spicy one). Conveniently Located for a quick fix.,Got the roasted duck Jian bing. One order is split between 2 paper bags so it's easy for sharing. The flavors were great and the duck was crunchy. Will come back again to try the other fillings! There was no one there when I went around 5:30pm.,Amazing Jian Bing and very fast service.  It's a bit hard to find, as it's a pop up at a boba shop.,It's a new concept from Beijing. It's crispy inside with special sauce. The portion is good for two girls. It's better to eat it within 20-30 minutes.,The first time I learned about this pop up was from another location. This time I ordered their Lamb Jian Bing and it was really tasty. The crisp inside the crepe was crispy while the outside is soft. It's yummy! Note that if you eat the crepe late the crisp inside will get soaky. So better eat it right after it's served.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Limoncello,"I came here with a group of friends for lunch!  Food came out very quickly. I ordered the veggie sandwich and it was delicious. I wish there had a been a bit more sauce but overall quite good.My friends ordered the Cuban and also the Goodfella. They sandwiches were massive and everyone was really satisfied. I feel like it's rare to find a restaurant/deli with 5 stars but Limoncello did not disappoint!,I've had this place bookmarked for a while now. It's not often you see a sandwich place with such good reviews as this place. For my first time I got the goodfella sandwich with spicy spread as it seems to be the most popular option here. First of all, they PACK the sandwich with meat. This thing is huge and a good price for what it is. We forgot to add the spicy spread hand asked for it when they were making it. Good thing we did because the sandwich is overall pretty dry. Having spread really helped moisten the bread. The Sandwich itself is really good with lots of flavor but I think I prefer hot sandwiches more. If you want a good cold sandwich this place is definitely one of the best with the amount of meat that is given and the flavors that are packed in. I would definitely love to come back to try their other sandwiches as well.,The sandwiches here are excellent. If you're craving a sandwich and are on the fence, the Milanese and Cuban are two great starting points. Excellent sides, too. Fairly priced. Limoncello is a great deli.,**4.5 stars rounded up to 5 stars**Super cute deli with a grocery store inside! It's fun to browse around and they have some pretty unique drinks, desserts, ingredients, etc. I got the Milanese Sandwich ($14.95), which had such fresh ingredients that paired well with the pesto. My sister made a fair comment that the sandwiches here are very bite-able. You never accidentally pull any large pieces of ingredients out when you take a bite since they just slice so well. I also had some of the Toscano Sandwich ($14.95), which was also delicious.These sandwiches are also HUGE, you can easily save half for another meal. I would definitely come back, but next time, I would add on their homemade Calabrian pepper spread for more spice!,Delicious sandwiches and there were so many to choose from! You can tell the quality is great and the service is just as amazing. The sandwiches taste so fresh and they are made to order. There is also a cute market attached to the sandwich place & I wanted to buy everything. Top advice: you can make any sandwich ""spicy"" and they add this amazing pepper sauce to the sandwich that elevates it to the next level-- it's a must if you want a mild kick. I haven't found another Italian deli spot that does it like them!,Bomb!!! Great place to grab a fast lunch with friends. I ordered the Goodfella which is their most popular sandwich. I added mayonnaise because I love a sandwich with mayonnaise and I think the extra element made the sandwich that much better 10/10. My friends ordered some other sandwiches, but they ended up enjoying my Goodfella sandwich the most! The menu can be a little overwhelming as there are tons of sandwiches but definitely give the most popular a try, it's the most ordered for a reason!,Excellent food, quick and friendly service, cool Italian deli ambiance.  I look forward to visiting again and trying more of their creative, tasty, and fresh sandwiches.,I drive all the way from Sacramento to this place, the food is fresh, the meat is great quality and the customer service is beyond expectations. The locations offers more than sandwiches, it also has really delicious salads, pastas, dessert and Italian groceries.,Me and my girlfriend recommend this place INSANELY. Food amazing, look at pics, staff extremely kind, and the inside of this deli, oh my god. It's so clean and so tidy, not a thing out of place. The Owner, or whoever the guy that helped us was, was SO nice and asked where we were from and for us to leave a review. Cutest most real authentic Italian deli, and we know, my girlfriend is from Italy.Edit: home now, we were in San Francisco for 4 days on vacation, we ate here 3 times,Tasty Italian sandwich although kinda pricey at $17 ish per sandwich. Got the mafioso and thought it was packed with flavor, esp the parts with bacon. I'd come back again to try another sandwich though!,Came here with a few friends after hearing amazing reviews! They have a deli section and a grocery section, both of which are pretty extensive! They have a large selection of Italian groceries and deli meats. My friend got the Milanese sandwich, which had a generous portion of meat! It had everything you would want from a sandwich. My other friend got the ravioli which looked good! They have tables outside and counters inside to eat at. Would recommend checking this place out!,Limoncello is a solid spot for a sandwich in pac heights. I was in the area running some errands and walking my dog so I decided to stop by and see what the hype was all about. It was around lunch time so I decided to call in my order. I got the Milanese sandwich on Dutch crunch which comes with pastrami, havarti cheese, green, tomatoes, pepperoncini, roasted red peppers with a homemade pesto spread. Flavor profile was good, pastrami was hardy and the bread had a nice crunch.,It was so difficult to choose a sandwich because they all looked amazing ! I ended up getting the Veneziano sandwich and did not disappoint. Loved the bread, and paired amazing with a Mole Cola and some dill pickle chipsSweet and friendly staff, and you can tell they're courteous to their customers. It's a cute spot for whatever Italian snacks and goods you need !,Aesthetic Italian store, huge sandwiches, slow service I called ahead to order my sandwich bc I had read reviews on how slow the service can be, and I still waited a while to pick up my food - they had lost the order ticket. The workers are relatively nice thoughThe store itself is really aesthetic and cute. The price of their items does air on the more expensive side, but it seems like the quality would be worth it. The sandwiches are about $16, but definitely can count for 2 meals. They don't skimp on ingredients and everything tastes fresh. The Ruben sandwich is really tasty, filled with just the right ratio of meat, cheese, and veggies. I'll definitely be back to try other things on their menu,Nice deli with Italian groceries, wine, and beer for sale. There are outside and limited indoor seating. I got The Godfather sandwich and it was OK the bread was hard for my upper mouth, but I also ate it about 30 minutes after ordering. Ingredients tasted super fresh, but not much flavor. I'd definitely come back to try another sandwich though.,Visiting the city for a vacation, found this gem!The environment is so clean and such a cute vibe.I ordered The Milanese sandwich it's was so tasteful and juicy, fresh & didn't make me feel heavy or bloated. Honestly really good place for a latte as well!! Very recommended,Best sandwich I have ever had. So many flavors that all compliment each other. I had the Porchetta sandwich and couldn't even finish the second half of it cause it was so huge! I am not complaining at all. If you have a big appetite like my husband, you could finish an entire sandwich. But if you are looking to split one, this is a great place to share. Very friendly staff. Will definitely be back if I'm ever traveling through San Francisco again.,We had the calibrese sandwich months ago...and I still think it's one of the best Italian sandwiches I've had! I remember craving Italian sandwiches for days after. I have no complaints or changes I'd make to the calibrese. It's worth the hype! Lovely store, so many food items to check out if you enjoy browsing. They have a really huge drink selection, limoncello alcoholic drinks everywhere. Saw a few CBD drinks in the refrigerated section, which I don't see often! The non-alcoholic white peach Bellini (bottled drink) was really good and I would get that again.,so happy i found this place! i love sandwiches and their sandwiches are amazing. i def plan to come back again whenever i am in SF. so many sandwiches to try!we tried the siciliano and mafioso sandwich. it was soo good. that bread was so soft. the sandwiches are big! no complaints! the staff is also super nice. we ate outside but i was too lazy to get up and get napkins. i was eventually gonna get one. but one of the staff saw i didn't have any napkins, so he went outside and gave us some. that was so nice!i wish they would open one in south bay. so goood!,This place is like a WaWa's but in SF and with alcohol. Plenty of street parking. Juan was very friendly with recommendations and showing us around the shop.,Found this spot through reviews and it didn't disappoint. We ordered the cuban sandwich and lasagna and both tasted so good. The sandwich is big and so tasty! They don't skimp on the meats and cheese. The lasagna was fresh and tasted so Italian, must be the pasta that they used. They have a mini grocery filled with Italian goodies - cookies, olive oil, spreads, cheeses, drinks, wine etc. I was like a little girl in the candy store. They're pet friendly to our small dog so we would definitely come here again!,4.5 stars! Stopped by after a long day of hiking with a friend. We ordered two sandwiches and split them. We ordered the Cuban and one other sandwich, don't remember which but the Cuban was definitely the standout. I was especially hungry and finished both halves in one sitting but they're definitely large sandwiches and one likely will be a meal and then some. The store also sells other nicely curated mostly Italian groceries. The owner was around and was so friendly but the guy making our sandwich was a bit rude and moving very slowly. Either way will definitely be back!,The good reviews here are spot-on. I don't even usually like sandwiches that much, but my curiosity got the best of me. You can easily place an order online on their website. There are some minor customization options available, but the best benefit is being able to see their full menu. Parking is street parking only, so check your meters before you leave the spot, even if you're just running in really quickly. We ordered online but probably still waited another 15 minutes after we arrived. 1. Mafioso: super tasty, very rich while also being light and refreshing! 2. Porchetta: this has arugula, which I hate. However the porchetta itself was very good. 3. Pesto pasta salad: this is a skip. It's pricey and a small portion. Total for 3 items was $45,Great vibes and delicious food. Upon walking into the store, I didn't know that it was like a little corner store. I came for the sandwiches and was pleasantly surprised by all the other items they were selling. We ordered the Good Fella and the Cuban sandwich, both on dutch bread. The ingredients tasted so fresh and we could tell they take a lot of care in making the sandwich. Also, it was such great value!! I only ate half of it and was so full. The meat tasted really good quality and flavorful. The store has some seating facing the windows and some tables outside. The service was fast and friendly too! Definitely recommend.,I didn't visit the establishment since we ordered Uber eats, but the sandwiches were pretty delicious!  They were served on a long roll (good bread) and were pretty filling, no matter the sandwich you get.,Alright, alright. If you don't like sandwiches we can't be friends. At one point in my life, I ate sandwiches for like 3 months straight because I was obsessed. I mean I would eat other food, but at least a sandwich a day. There's so much good food in SF. All kinds of food. However, when I stumbled upon this place via Yelp, I knew I had to try it. I was already on a time crunch to get to the airport, however, I knew I needed to try this place and let me tell ya. worth it! I made it to the airport, but if I didn't I wouldn't even be mad haa.I got The Mafioso Sandwich and it was delicious! Came on a Monday around lunch time and it wasn't too packed. Nice and friendly staff. Pricing is decent. Super cool shop attached.I WANT TO GO BACK!!! A must try!,Fun Italian deli and market (that looks like also has a wine bar/cafe in the middle?). It really reminds me of panino shops in Italy. I ordered the Calabrese Sandwich, super filling and delicious! There were a few seats around the market so it's fun to be able to sit in. They also have aperitivo like foods that I definitely want to try next time!,I was in town for a few months and was on a desperate search for a good Italian sandwich that could fulfill my east coast deli craving. Limoncello did just that! The Siciliano was amazing and I'm not embarrassed to say that I finished it in one sitting. Whenever I make it back to SF, I will absolutely stop in again.,Our new favorite local sandwich spot!! I've always wanted to try this spot as we've been looking for more options for sandwiches. They have a huge selection of specialty sandwiches.  We ordered the Mafioso and the Veggie. We both were impressed with the quality of the bread/rolls...light crisp, not too bread-y, actually pulls apart when we bite into it so don't have to struggle and make a mess with the ingredients falling out (you know what I'm talking about!).  The ingredients are quality and portion was huge! I could only half the Mafioso. Bf ate entire Veggie roll. I can't wait to order from them again because there was so many on the menu that I wanted to try. If you order pickup, order directly from their website (or call) which saves them paying high commission to third party sites (Grubhub, DoorDash, etc).,I took a short walk to Limoncello for lunch today. I've heard a lot of good things about this place. It's a restaurant and mini market all in one. Limoncello is located on the corner of Sutter and Franklin. It's a small, cute and cozy spot. I ordered my food online to dine in.Their online menu had so many options when it comes to sandwiches, pasta, and so much more! I had trouble picking out what to eat, everything just sounded so tasty! I decided on the Milanese sandwich on a ciabatta roll and a can of San Pellegrino sparkling water, blood orange flavor (sooo good!). The Milanese has pastrami, havarti cheese,pesto spread, balsamic vinegar, roasted bell pepper, pepperoncini, tomato, and I forgot what else. The sandwich was delicious!! It was good with every bite. The staff that prepared my sandwich quite a few slices of pastrami. Which is not always the case when ordering a sandwich at some restaurants, they will skimp on the meat and have the NERVE to charge you extra! Not at Limoncello. The sandwich was about the size of a football, split in half. You can share your sandwich or save the other half for later. It definitely is worth the price!I ate in at a table by the window and enjoyed the view outside (there's also tables outside, but it was way too windy to eat outside!!). After eating half my sandwich (I was pretty full!), I ordered dessert. I decided on cannoli, the 3 pack (There's also a 5 pack...this place is so dangerous!! LOL). I ate one after I left and it was so sweet! I loved every bite. It looked like it had a few pieces of chocolate chips in the filling. They figured out the way to a girl's heart, y'all. I felt the love in every bite of my sandwich and that cannoli!I definitely would stop by Limoncello again! Highly recommend this place!! The staff were friendly, helpful, and moved pretty quick to serve the line of customers! The food left me excited for my next visit! Ciao until next time!,The best part about Yelp is finding hidden gems especially when you're traveling! Limoncello is a ""straightforward deli"" with Italian dishes (pizza, lasagna, side dishes), sandwiches, desserts, and wine/beer! You can also pick up some grocery goodies! You can take your order to go or have them on the patio tables. There is a bathroom but it had an out of order sign.There were so many different sandwich options but since bf and I weren't too hungry we decided to split the Siciliano, their version of the classic Italian. We added extra meat! Sharing the Siciliano was a wise decision; it was enough to whet our appetites without feeling stuffed.  Everything was fresh- the bread, the veggies, and the meat! It was definitely a tasty sandwich! I would be a regular if I lived in San Fran!Limoncello lives up to the hype- fresh, affordable, and delicious!,Thank you Yelp for helping me find this gem! After walking over 1000 feet of hills in the city, we were famished & this spot certainly satiated us.  Such a beautiful display of their various Limoncellos, salamis and other goodies.  The sandwiches are huge! I had the veggie sandwich which was chock full of fresh veggies (portobello, tomatoes, avocado, eggplant, etc).  The latte was excellent- nice & strong clearly made with good coffee beans.  There are tables outside to enjoy as well as a bar counter inside to dine.,Drove across the city to try this after the hype from my friend. When you enter, you'll have to order from the register and then pick up from the counter. The store has lots of food items you can browse through while waiting.2 sandwiches were $30+. Decent amount of meat but didn't find anything particularly special. Hubs wasn't too impressed.,Came on a Saturday afternoon and we were able to walk up and order right away. Got the Mafioso Sandwich and it was super yummy! The sandwich was big enough for us to split so it felt like a good deal for the amount of food and quality. Plus, the sandwich shop is attached to a cute Italian market so it was fun browsing while we waited for our food. Would definitely recommend this place if you're craving a good sandwich!,Every time I'm in the city, I make it a point to pick up one of their sammies. Never have they failed to disappoint!Tried the Mafioso this time as suggested by the fellow behind counter.  Perfect in every way!,Favorite sub shop in all of San Francisco. Their bread is delicious their cold cuts are delicious and their pesto pasta salad is great too. They have a spicy sauce on the sandwich that you can ask for and it makes it so much better. Win-win,Love the sandwiches here! The staff and owner are super friendly and the service is great. It reminded me of the time when I lived in Italy. My favorite sandwich is the speciale and I replace the hot coppa with prosciutto. Highly recommend and if you're looking for the full experience, you can also grab the sandwiches to go and walk to Lafayette park which is a few blocks away for a picnic!,Great sandwich! Cute store, nice employees. I got the goodfellas sandwich with avocado (+$3) and pesto (+$1). The pesto was a little salty but otherwise it was great and would come back.,I'm not a sandwich girl but limoncello changed me. I absolutely loved the sandwiches here (esp mafioso); the meat is so HQ!,The most over rated sandwich place ever! sandwiches are ok but the owner has a very nasty attitude as well as his wife! I called to let them know I paid for extra chicken and there was not extra mean in my sandwich. He started calling me names son of b and f y and faggot etc...This guy is a psycho. Their food is not even that great neither but his behavior with his wife and his worker was shocking and disgraceful. Small portions and expensive! subway tastes way better than this place. Trust me! I won't come back!,What a great find! Our daughter hates coming into the city, but for this she made an exception! She loves Italian food, so now she knows where to come for her groceries...and wine!Service was excellent. Sandwiches were yummy. Outdoor café table and chairs were all we needed for this pit stop. Next time we visit I will have to get an affogato. I was craving one and we went traipsing all over SF in search of one. I COULD HAVE GOTTEN ONE HERE! Gelato + Espresso = Affogato!  Until next time...,My friend and I ordered on their website and it was ready in about 35 minutes on a Sunday evening. We shared the Mafioso and Goodfella sandwiches. We liked the Mafioso better, but they were both so amazing! I'm a huge sandwich lover so I was super excited to try this spot and it delivered! The sandwiches are packed with so many ingredients and so much flavor. 10/10 would come again!,My husband and I were visiting San Francisco over Christmas. We were looking for a good lunch spot that was open on Christmas Day. We found Limoncello on yelp; I'm so glad that we did. The sandwiches were amazing. I got the Milanese and my husband got the Goodfella. We got them spicy which I think is a must. The bread was soft and fresh. The proportions of meat, cheese, bread, and fresh vegetables were absolutely perfect. The sandwiches were huge. Neither of us could finish ours. We also tried the macaroni salad which was delicious and creamy. The space is really unique. It is half market, half deli. There is counter top seating so that you can stop and have a glass of wine and enjoy the tasty food. Limoncello also sells bottles of wine, fresh desserts, and espresso drinks. The owner was very friendly. We love this place and will definitely be back on our next visit to San Francisco.,This has consistently good reviews but is advised that this is a Deli, not a restaurant, and there is no signage. Since its a deli, prices are very reasonable. There's a nice selection of wines and Italian groceries, too.The eggplant parmesan and lasagna were both very good. I also recommend the limoncello cake and their coffee.Buon apetito!,Friend recommended this place and it's only a few blocks away from the climbing gym. Large portions and tastes great! I got the Siciliano and my friend got the Milanese.- Bread is incredibly soft (but not soggy!)- The Siciliano's olive oil and balsamic vinegar was really refreshing with the sandwich. & the Milanese had a really nice basil pesto spread too.- Packed with a lot of meat. There's also a little market with things like pasta, cakes, and candy too. I really liked the lemon drop candy and ""Galvanina Organic Sparkling Blood Orange"" drink from one of the fridges.,Ok time to write my review. The first time I got a sandwich with mortadella, all the filling was good  but the problem was the bread I had was so bad! It was stale and ruined my whole experience. I paid good money for that sandwich and hate wasting food but I actually couldn't eat it anymore and dumped the bread and just ate the inside. I work close by and gave them another shot this week. Got the porchetta sandwich, $18! Again meat was good, this time I got Dutch crunch bread, that was good too, not stale. They redeemed themselves but honestly for almost $20 a sandwich I've had way better elsewhere. For example, palm city wines, little Lucas, Lou's sandwich, all better in my opinion. I would go back though if I really want a sandwich or try their pasta or pizza only because I work close by.,I've been here about 3-4 times. Owners are probably the nicest people I've met in San Francisco! I haven't been here since they added the woman life freedom to the front of the store but I'm super hyped to check out the new decor. I'm writing this review because my friend brought me a sandwich and it was absolutely delicious! The meat was obviously very fresh and just cut. I am a strong supporter of this place wishing them business for years,Limoncello is a hidden gem in San Francisco. They offer a variety of delicious wines and cheeses, and their deli provides tasty sandwiches you can grab on the go. I found the staff really friendly and helpful, and each time I went I felt welcomed. You get a ton of value for what you pay for, and the staff keeps the shop clean and orderly. If you're in the area and want to grab some groceries or even a sandwich on your way to the park, stop by at Limoncello.,This place was sooo good. You can tell the sandwiches are quality because even the greens were vibrant and delicious. I will certainly be back!,Really enjoyed my visit to Limoncello! Has a very Italian feel to it. I ordered the Calabrese sandwich - ingredients were fresh and it had good flavor. I wasn't blown away by any means but it is a quality sandwich. There are a few seats for dine in but it is primarily a take away business. Definitely worth coming to if you're in SF.,Good place. Big market on the inside with a ton of goods from Italy. Good sandwiches too with real Italian meats.,The Milanese and The Siciliano Sandwich were delicious, filling, and fairly priced! I'd definitely come back to try some of their other sandwiches. The line moved quickly and our sandwiches came out about 5-7 minutes after we ordered.,First of all, they PACK the sandwich with meat.,The sandwiches here are excellent.,Very delicious but tell me why we had to wait about 40 minutes for our two sandwiches.. They weren't even that busy and it wasn't until we asked what the status was later, until they said there was a ticket mix up and they hadn't made them yet. So weird cuz we were waiting near the front the whole time for the sandwiches, and the guy who had taken our order saw us waiting. You would think that he would see us waiting so long and think, ""hey they're still waiting, maybe I should check on their order?"" LOL. And when he finally gave us our sandwiches, no apology or nothing. Blah but they sure know how to make a good sandwich. I got the veggie and damn was it delicious!,Limoncello saved me when I was asked by a dear friend of mine to provide lunch for a birthday event the day before. It was a tall order and the birthday boy was Italian, an Italian New Yorker who requested subs haha.I knew what deli I would call immediately! Limoncello! They crafted beautifully made deli sandwiches for the party. Two platters of delicious, mouth-watering, Italian sandwiches. Best you'll get in San Francisco ! Most importantly, it was approved by my Italian-American friend who's palette is not easily swayed. If you're looking for a delectable Italian deli sandwich with fresh loafs of bread and outstanding selection of cured meats- Limoncello is the place to go!Create food memories,Isabelle Pinard,Felt compelled to try a sandwich from here after seeing the 5 star rating! Got the chicken pesto and wasn't amazed...Not sure if people are rating it for the pastrami sandwiches or the grocery store or gelato but wasn't very impressed.+ was a good portion size for one person - Not super flavorful- Pricey at like $13... There are better sandwich spots (like Lou's)...,I'm not a big sandwich person, but I realized after having this sandwich that I guess I just wasn't having good sandwiches before... I saw this place already had raving reviews so thought I would give sandwiches another try and was so still surprised by how amazing this sandwich was. I ordered the siciliano sandwich with no pepperoncinis (I can't take spice, sorry ) for dinner. The bread was toasted yet soft. The meat was so filling and tasted fresh and seasoned. It's honestly hard to describe and explain how good it was, so just go yourself a favor and go here!  It is a deli and Italian convenience store so you can also grab some wine, chips and other snacks to go with your amazing sandwich.,These are seriously seriously good sandwiches. They're pricey but they certainly deliver the quality that makes them a fair value.,This place is good. I enjoyed the mafiaso and caprese sandwich. You get a lot of sandwich for your buck (I was VERY full after finishing one sandwich. I recommend splitting half a sandwich and trading another half with a friend to taste different types of sandwiches. Conveniently next to the market as well for refreshments and any other add ons you may want to have for your sandwich. Owner rang us up and was very personable. Workers here were stellar. Would definitely come back here again.,Stopped by Limoncello after checking out the Yelp rating. Charming looking deli. I had the tuna salad, siciliano, cannoli. They make the cannoli in house.(The tiramisu is imported from Italy. Frozen tiramisu isn't appealing to me; I prefer freshly made. So  I did not try it) Overall, the food was decent. Surprisingly, the bottled club soda was FLAT. Not sure about quality control here. Not sure why pics pics are not showing up.,I mean it's just a sandwich, what's the big deal anyways....words that would never come out of my mouth! I happen to be the guy that would choose a good deli sandwich over a Wagyu cut of beef, or whatever constitutes fine dining these days. Limoncello is an absolute standard for deli sandwich shops. I've only had the chance to come a handful of times, but it only takes one visit to appreciate everything that is Limoncello. It really isn't that complicated.... When the right fresh quality Ingredients come together, it's magic. It's a Monet painting....the colors hit the canvas like these ingredients hit the pillowey chewy bread.... Technically every single deli meat and cheese is at your disposal, but could you and I really have thought up the Napolitano, Mafioso, Calabrese, or Goodfella? We are mere mortals in the presence of these master sandwich artisans. You know how everyone has those kind of places that they can truly get lost in? They say I'll only be a few minutes, then an hour later you're trying to figure out what can they possibly be doing in such a small place?! That's me....in a sandwich shop that doubles up as an Italian market. You find them all over the country, but not all are created equal. If there is a Mount Rushmore of sandwich shop, Limoncello has a rightful place.,I get skeptical when I see a place that straight up has 5 stars, and I get more skeptical when I see it's a sandwich spot. Either way, was told great things and ordered a sandwich for delivery, which actually made it to me early!FOOD:The Siciliano Sandwich. I don't know what to say. It's simple perfection. The bread is soft, yet firm enough to hold the massive contents of the sandwich. The meats are high quality and incredibly tasty. I come from a local sandwich spot with lots of sauce, and was skeptical because there wasn't too much sauce emphasized on this, but the simplicity of oil and vinegar with these ingredients is seriously classic perfection. Tanginess from the vinegar and pepperoncinis gave is the brightness. Highly recommended.Overall, a simply great classic sandwich. I would gladly come back to try the rest as it clearly is not just this specific sandwich I got. The quality is there in the ingredients and it is easy to tell. You don't just have a solid 5 stars for no reason. I will obviously be excited to come back.,One stop shop for a delicious, oversized, fresh sandwich with a variety of side options and drink pairings (alcohol or non-alcoholic) to choose from! My Doctor's office is right around the corner so every visit, this is a must lunch stop for me. A little pricey, yes, but it's SF and you do get your money's worth since they pack their sandwiches! The service is good, quick as they have quite the foot traffic! The gentleman (who I believe is the owner) is always in a good mood which really makes this place that much better with them being so welcoming! This place definitely will have me coming back each and every time I'm around!,Some people say this is the best sandwich place in the city but I'm going to have to disagree. Got a Mafioso on Dutch crunch and it was rather disappointing - the bread itself was stale like day old bread, and on one end the meat almost disappeared. Overall it was salty, oily, and was just an ok sandwich. Lovely store and staff though!,Wide variety of delicious sandwiches and pretty good lemon marscopone cake. If you are in the area worth a stop to pick up a sandwich. First time there and decided to go with the Cuban and Mafioso. Both sandwiches were good. The Cuban was a beef sausage roast beef and ham sandwich. The Mafioso was more of your Italian meat sandwich. I only wish they served them toasted...would be even better. Maybe next time I will ask if they can toast the sandwiches,I got the veggie sandwich. This is probably one of the freshest veggie sandwiches I've had in SF and in complete alignment with what everyone says about this sandwich. I believe they carve out a little of the bread so that they have fit more veggies inside. I was just hoping for the bread to be toasted. Nonetheless, a great sandwich place and they have some nice Italian ingredients in the shop for purchase.,Found this place on Yelp. BF has been raving about having a craze for sandwiches lately and stumbled across this place. We came after building up an appetite from the pride festival. Place is really cute and welcoming. Kinda like a different country feel and smells amaz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ng. People are really friendly and food comes out fairly fast. I ordered the good fella sandwich with spicy spread as suggested in other reviews. It was a plus and I was even able to purchase my own jar for the house. Sandwich bread was really soft and packed with flavor. More of the veggies then anything but gave it a fresh and healthy taste. I also normally don't opt to have peppercinis on my sandwich but they way they do it gives it a good dimension of flavor and bearable. My only dislike is the prosciutto that was added to the sandwich. Since all the other meat was thicker this meat stood out a lot and kinda tasted like fat when chewing because it had a softer texture. Not a fan but that's my opinion. I would probably try without next time. I did see a few other sandwiches I would like to try and prices are about average .,I hate to give this review, because I've had Limoncello in the past and they've been delicious. BUT, I went to get a sandwich to go today and was appalled by how little meat was in the sandwich. Like is this a joke? I mean, I know inflation but wow, you gotta be kidding me. Super unfortunate as I do like this sandwich spot. But I'm not paying $15 a sandwich for this..,EASILY the best sandwich I've ever had!! Was in San Francisco for the week on a work trip and walked over to this gem from my hotel. Did NOT disappoint. I'm a little annoyed at myself for not coming here on my first day in town. I would have gone here every evening to try different items. They all looked and smelt delicious!,I've yet to come across a deli that doesn't charge $9,000 for a small side of pasta salad so this place didn't disappoint. (Its $6 but its tiny and it's literally just noodles/sauce.) I got the siciliano sandwich and it was fucking delicious. no other notes. just a really good fucking sandwich. Ok bye.,Wonderful Italian sandwiches! The meat to veggies to bread ratio is perfect. With the tartness from the balsamic, freshness of the meat and the sun dried tomatoes was divine. My only critic would be of the bread. The bread is a bit dry and regardless of the condiments used it leaves a dryness in the mouth. If they switched out the bread to a bit softer interior this sandwich would be perfect. I would definitely go back!,The staff was very friendly and kind. We got the Goodfella, it was so yummy ! So much flavor ! It was my partner and I first time here, would 100% recommend and am coming back again.,What  a gem of a store!You walk in and you're greeted by Italian goodies prepackaged or freshly made to order.  I ended up ordering a Petto de Pollo sandwich to go. In my wait time for the sandwich, the nicest owner ever suggested that I add pesto to my sandwich, which I happily obliged. Finally getting to dig into my sandwich, it was love at first bite.  It was just so many things that combined beautifully: bitter, lemony, spicy, savory. The bread was fresh and soft. Really, I could've had that for lunch every day for a month, but sadly, I live on the opposite coast. Overall, if you live in the area, definitely give them a shot!,Amazing food and options. Staff was friendly and quick to get our food to us. The Goodfella was excellent and very filling.,This deli has the best sandwiches in San Francisco according to Yelp. With 5 stars and 1400 reviews I had to give them a try. I got the Calabrese on a Dutch crunch since I was intrigued by the cayenne-rubbed pork shoulder. I really liked how the greens were dressed for more flavor but I was a little disappointed by the flavor overall. Next I tried the Toscano - this had way more flavor. The dry salami was delicious and Dijon mustard paired really well. Maybe not the BEST in the city but I thought the sandwiches were solid and I'd definitely come back to try the others.,Great spot for a delicious sandwich and a quick snack. Never not loved whatever I pick up.,This place was just across the street from my hotel so we stopped by to grab a quick dinner. They have an extensive menu of sandwiches and salads. Sandwiches generally seem to run $10-15 each depending on how many premium ingredients you want. I went with the mafioso because it has three different proteins including bacon, greens, pepperoncini, tomato and multiple condiments-mayonnaise, olive oil and vinegar. This was a very tasty sandwich. You get fluffy bread with a nice crust and tons of meat and veggies. The combination of everything was very tasty. In addition to the deli section they also have a store with Italian desserts and snacks and a large alcohol selection. I was excited they had a big section of beers from Russian River brewery. We ended up getting Intinction -a beer aged in wine barrels. It tasted like a sour and went really well with our sandwiches. Overall a great deli stop with plenty of options. They have vegetarian options as well.,We placed a group order via doordash for our team lunch. It was particularly important that our names were well labelled as some people have dietary restrictions. Given how Doordash is not reliable when placing a group order, I called to ensure that the order was actually scheduled. They were still not seeing our scheduled order in their system, but promptly figured out. But they let me know one of the items that was listed on doordash is not available, and gave them what to replace with. I asked them multiple times to make sure to label with everyone's names as that was the most important part. On the day of delivery, I got a call and was told that their oven broke so they could not make a pizza and made something else instead. Im afraid if multiple people ordered pizza, could have been a nightmare. But the most frustrating part was that our orders were not labelled with our names and the handwriting was illegible, using abbreviations. It was a quite frustrating experience and we are still happy to order again but hope the could update their doordash menu and make sure everyone's names are written or at least indicate clearly what sandwich it is.,Wanted to really like this place since it was highly recommended by several friends, but it was pretty mediocre.  Got the mafioso on Dutch crunch and bread was stale/sandwich on the salty and oily side.  At first I thought it was just bc of my meat selection, but the veggies were also salty and oily.,Limoncello is located on a busy corner with difficult parking options. It really is a hidden gem as it's not really a restaurant- it's mainly a deli shop that also sells a variety of wines, though there are outdoor tables for patrons to enjoy their meal. They also had some Mitchell's ice cream available in their store.The sandwiches are literally the size of my forearm (or bigger to be honest)- I definitely split one sandwich into two meals. I ordered the Mafioso sandwich which comes with turkey, bacon, etc., and it was packed to the brim with meat. The veggies they used were good too and weren't the typical iceberg lettuce you'd get some sandwich shops. Their deli meat was packed with flavor and sooo much better than the meat you would find at regular supermarkets!,Got the Goodfella, ate it at Ina Coolbrith park, a very peaceful dinner. I finished the entire thing in the sitting and was a good full. There wasn't too much bread or too little filling, it was a satisfying sandwich!,The owner, Chris, welcomes you, invites you in, and supports the local community by sponsoring Refuse Refuse and I'm sure he supports other community organizations! Thank you! I tried the Alpine sandwich on dutch crunch - the olive oil popped and the bacon added crunch. Delicious and generously sized.,Good food. Not great for large groups. Bathroom was very clean. The beer and wine was really good! I loved it. I'd come back.,Absolutely cant go wrong here. Everything is SO fresh and packed with flavor. The turkey is some of the best I've ever had. The spicy sauce is to die for!! Bread is always super crisp on the outside but fluffy on the inside and the veggies are always very fresh.There's a reason this place is so popular, they've absolutely mastered the perfect deli sandwich. Will be back every time I'm in SF.,Wow! This place is amazing. We had the Mafioso with spicy spread ($1 extra) and my gosh, every single bite was fantastic. The bread was phenomenal, the meat was so fresh, and the spread was *chefs kiss*. We also grabbed some sardines and crackers Ali my with some of their canned cocktails and went to have a little picnic spread with a bridge view at Chrissy Field. They have a huge selection of authentic Italian groceries, olives, pasta, sauces, spreads, breadsticks, etc. We will absolutely be back. Do yourself a favor and go!,I was craving a sandwich for a weekday lunch, so a friend and I ordered online for pick-up from Limoncello. I ordered the Goodfella and my friend ordered the Mafioso. We loved them both - the meat cuts were SO good and the portions were generous. It seemed like they massaged olive oil into the greens before putting them into the sandwiches, which made all the difference in the texture. And despite the fact that there was a lot of meat packed into the sandwiches, they didn't feel heavy. I added spicy sauce into mine ($1 extra), and it packed the perfect amount of heat without overpowering the other flavors.It was easy to order online and go into the store to pick up the sandwiches. The shop was cozy and homey, and it smelled so good from the prepared pasta they had available by the registers.,This place is a gem! The most amazing sandwiches! Cute spot with very quick service if you are on the go.,The owner of this business is absolutely insane and has no clue of what customer service is about. He can't even admit when he's wrong. We ordered sandwiches that took an hour to be made because the staff made a mistake. The owner yelled and accused anyone but himself (isn't it your business..? Take responsibility!)We have been regulars for several years but this behavior is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. We will never be back and strongly advise others to beware of anything going wrong with your order. After all, it's easy when things go right, but the real question is: how do you handle a situation when things go wrong?,Wonderful sandwiches, nice people and a tidy eating area. You're gonna be so happy you made time for this stop.,Limoncello is a local sandwich and Italian specialty shop that opened up in the Cathedral Hill area just before the Great Panic of 2020. Not certain how they survived but they persisted. I never went there although living on the same block until just April. My first sandwich there was, well, meh. The second visit was much better, almost didn't go because of the disappointment, but necessity demanded a second visit. The first was a mozzarella sandwich, the second a much more delicious variety of Italian meats. Sorry, lost my photos, but if in Lower Pacific Heights, give the meat based sandwiches a try. They could work on the service a little, perhaps a friendly smile?,My second time coming here. The first time, I stumbled on this place using Yelp and wanted to check it out. So happy I did! Honestly, one of the best Italian sandwiches I've ever had. I ordered the GoodFella sandwich and added olives. My only suggestion would be to pay the extra for double meat. They also had a selection of yummy Italian treats and take home pastas. Next time I'm definitely going to have to give the lasagna a try. I drive all the way from Sacramento just to get a sandwich so that says a lot. The owner (I believe that's who it was) was super nice and friendly. He even brought me and my mom out napkins when we were eating our food. This goes without saying, I will continue to make the drive from Sacramento to get these sandwiches.,Great salad and sandwiches at Limoncello. We tried them via delivery and in person dining. They have a few outside tables, so we like to bring our Bik's with us when eating here. My fave is the caprese salad and I like to add prosciutto.,Cute shop that is reminiscent of something I could find on the streets of Italy.  Limoncello has become my go to spot for a quick meal or to pick sandwiches up for a picnic. Every sandwich (The Milanese, Napolitano, Porcetta) I've tried has been amazing!They also have a fair amount of Italian goods and wine, as well as gelato and pastries. I'm usually not a big sandwich person, but when I am in the mood, Limoncello is where you can find me.,Parking as always is a pain to find in sf. The interior was nice and classy. With all the different meats, it smelled amazing. I ordered theGoodfellas sandwich (5/5): all of the ingredients were really well balanced. The basil had a really good kick in terms of its unique flavor. Google/apple pay is accepted. Limoncello is a delicious place for a fat sandwich albeit a bit on the pricy side. I would come back here though.,I'd take a picture of the meatball sandwich I ate but somehow I ate it before I could get my phone out. This place is awesome highly recommend,Tasty sandwiches. Something different and authentic. Very fresh , quality meats and cheeses.,Fresh ingredients, cute place, lady was nice but was working alone trying to work 3 stations. the sandwich was a lot of bread but hardly any meat. Good quality ingredients but too skimp for me. It was all filla and no thrilla. Potato salad was yummy though. Just an ok experience. The meat quality was good but not enough.,This place is awesome, nice friendly people and tasty sandwiches. Tried petto di pollo and eggplant Parmesan both were good., Liked eggplant more as eggplant is soft and tastes awesome - added avacado ( pricey $3) and spicy spread. Also they some good Italian goodies - took some pastas and chocolates for home.,Great shop with sandwiches, gelato, ice cream, and more. I love getting a sandwich here then walking to eat it in Lafayette Park. They also have good caprese salad and bread. Love the vibe inside--very homely, cozy," and intimate--and service is friendly.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sweet Maple,"Went here for brunch, it was a long wait to be seated inside. They had outdoor seatings with heat lamps. Staff were fast and friendly. I enjoyed the black stone Benedict with potatoes. I think next time I'll try it with the fries. The portions were decently sized.,Weekends are walk-in only, so make sure you get there early! My husband and I went right as they opened and we got a table. Sweet Maple fills up FAST! Service and food here was phenomenal! The only catch is that the prices are on the steeper side. If you go during busy hours, I can see how you'd have to wait a long time for food (tables next to us experienced that). Since we got there early enough to put in our orders, we got our food about 15-20 minutes after ordering. Food we got: - Millionaire's Bacon (Citron, Original, Cinnamon, and Rosemary flavors): Loved this sampler platter so much! Never in my life did I expect to try citron flavored bacon. I did find that the original was still my favorite. If you're iffy about the other flavors, just get the original bacon. Probably the best bacon I've had in my life. - SM Omurice: From the test kitchen specials. I probably could have gotten a cheaper omurice somewhere else, but this was cooked very well considering how hard it is to make. I could barely finish this dish alone because there was so much food! - Soufflegg Skillets: Also from the test kitchen specials. We were intrigued by the name and decided to give this a try as well. It definitely sounded fancier on paper. At the end of the day, it's just another skillet with a lot of potato. Still yum (egg was cooked so well), but we were expecting something a little bit more unique for $22+. We completely fell into a food coma after this menu and had to get a second coffee. If you're looking for a heavy brunch spot, this is your place!! You won't leave hungry!,Waited for an hour to eat inside on a Sunday for brunch! Got to the restaurant around 11:30am-go earlier to avoid the long line! Ordered the Californian burger, meat to be cooked medium, with crispy potato wedges. The burger was tasty. The menu indicated that the burger with be spicy with little chili pepper sign but I didn't find the burger spicy at all. The meat was moist. The potato wedges were definitely crispy and were well seasoned. I had a sip of the coconut cream latte. It tasted like hot sweetened coconut milk-it was nice. My table ordered two coconut cream lattes but I noticed that the level of the drink to the foam wasn't consistent between the two cups. My bf chose the Blackstone Benedict. He wouldn't get it again-he didn't like the sweetness of the millionaires bacon with the eggs. The bacon flavor overpowered the dish. He didn't think the Meyer lemon hollandaise had any lemon flavor at all. Some of his potatoes in the potato medley were roasted too dark. My sister chose the bulgogi scramble. She said it was mainly meat and not much eggs-I know eggs are more expensive now but still... She didn't end up liking her dish. Servers made sure to top off our water cups. However, my table received the bill when I was still eating-I had a couple bites of my burger left and there wasn't a line at the door!There are two unisex restrooms-be ready to wait in line on busy days.,Bottomless mimosas? Sounds like college--but we were reminiscing so that's our excuse.The line wrapped around the corner, but moved quickly. We sat 9 within 15 minutes! Outside was a vibe, especially with the gorgeous weather. The food was great, the staff was friendly and hard working, and the mimosas had no bottom. I suggest anything with the Millionaire's Bacon and the blue raspberry mimosa (don't expect outstanding flavor rather, drink it because it looks like slurp juice from Fortnite--I love Fortnite).,The highlights? Those fluffy and crisp clouds that are the air-fried potatoes are the definition of chef's kiss and that millionaires bacon, well there's a reason they have shirts about it. But other than that, just your run of the mill brunch spot with prices that'll have you doing a double take. We ordered the south of the boarder scramble, traditional eggs Benedict, and a side of the millionaires bacon to share. Though we would've loved to try the bacon sampler, we couldn't bring ourselves to spend $24 on 4 strips. The scramble was good but super spicy to my weak palette, I thought I'd get used to it with time, but the more I ate it, the hotter it seemed to get. Benny was also good, very traditional and comparable with other benny's I've had. Was a nice break from the heat of the scramble. We came on a weekday morning shortly after they opened. We were seated immediately and food came out quickly. Overall it was a classic case of hype so high, it's hard to live up to. Don't get me wrong, the food was really good, but at those prices, it's not a spot I plan to frequent.,Came here for my birthday brunch and it did not disappoint! First of all their bacon.. I've never had the most tastiest bacon! I would come back solely for the bacon again. Their omelet was really tasty as well. The matcha was good, I like mine a little sweeter but if you like a strong matcha you'd like this one. Overall the dining experience was great and I would deff come back!,Was in the area for an appointment on a Tuesday and thought we'd grab brunch since we're in SF and do not come here as often as we'd like. With just a quick yell search for brunch, Sweet Maple popped as it was the closest to us. I read the reviews and was a little hesitant about the wait time, but to my surprise, there wasn't a wait at all, so we were lucky enough to have been seated right away. The servers were extremely friendly, gave us recommendations, but there were a few times where we weren't able to track them down and to go get our own napkin and utensils. My husband had the French toast, I can't really speak to that as he said ""it was cool"" - yeah, he's not a foodie like myself. My dad had the Savory Souffleg - he ate pretty much the entire dish, which is a testament to how good it was because typically he just picks at his food! The egg was very fluffy and the did not cheap out on the shrimps. I got the Blackstone Benedict's, the English muffin was extremely hard to chew but the overall flavor was amazing, it had a really nice spicy kick to it as well. Definitely craving this dish as I am writing this review! Parking is a bit tough, but of course that's SF for you. I highly recommend coming here on a week day to avoid long lines, more attention to details from your server, and easier parking.,I can't get enough of the French toast here! I think the millionaires bacon is a bit overrated for its price but I know that's quite a controversial take haha.I love the breakfast here. I come here pretty frequently and I always have a good time. This was my fourth time back in 6 months.,FOOD (+1 star) - got the big hip, two egg plate with millionaire bacon and fruit (~$24), a coffee ($5) and fresh squeezed oj ($7). It cost like $70 with tip for breakfast, a bit steep if you ask me. Maybe that's normal for SF nowadays? Glad I don't live in the city and have to pay that normally.. anyways, I did enjoy the food. The big hip was more like a pancake to me than French toast, but I liked it. The millionaire bacon was disappointing, but the upgrade price wasn't too bad (compared to other restaurants). The fruit was good - fresh and a good mix (grapefruit, kiwi, orange, blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries). They came around frequently to refill coffee. The fresh squeezed oj was good, but would've been better if it was cold. I liked the pulpiness, but I know pulp isn't for everyone. I would pass on it in the future though. SERVICE (+1 star) - quick and friendly. Didn't really have to wait for anything and food came out super quick. Came in around 8:30 am on a Friday and it was mostly full, but I don't think there was a wait until we left (9:15ish) and even then it wasn't long at all. LOCATION (+1 star) - it was convenient to where I was staying on Lombard st, so that was nice. Street parking was easy to find. INSIDE (+1 star) - fairly large, especially compared to most other restaurants in SF. It's pretty cold inside, which seems to be the norm (idk why). There's outdoor seating as well. Liked the ambiance/decor. Overall, enjoyed my experience and the food. I would come back, but wish they had more items that I would like to try. I'm kinda picky but usually there are a few items I have a hard time deciding between and that just wasn't the case here. Also, $70 for breakfast is a splurge so would definitely skip on upgrading to things like millionaire bacon.,Sweet Maple offers a classic brunch of sweet and savory options with a twist of Asian flavors and flares sprinkled in. I came here with a friend around 1PM on a Sunday, and the line to be seated wasn't too long (~15min wait). They really hyped up this spot with the millionaire's bacon and other options, so I was excited to try it out and test it out for myself. The interior was well lit and can be a bit loud since there's the seating is fairly tight. Here's a rundown of what we ordered:- Millionaire's Bacon (4/5): Flavorful, rich, crisp, and yummy hitting all the right spots if you're a bacon enthusiast with a sweet tooth. The glaze/sauce they use to cook the bacon in is heavily on the sweeter side. I have a large sweet tooth, so I enjoyed it pretty heavily though!- Savory Souflegg (4/5): Was really intrigued with the souflegg since I'm a big egg fan. However, don't be a clown like me and burn yourself by touching the skillet since it'll burn you . The souflegg was a light, puffy cloud of an omelette. The interior was pretty moist and jiggly to slice into. This was super filling, so we ended up just splitting the souflegg.Overall, Sweet Maple lived up to the hype. The flavors and environment reminded me of Berkeley Social Club as well, I definitely will be checking out Steven Choi's other spots soon.,Had to fuel up for some sightseeing in the city. Naturally, sweet maple was our choice for Sunday breakfast. We got there early around 9am and we're seated immediately! The space was lively and inviting. Our server was helpful to provide his recommendations from the menu. He checked up on us and was super friendly. Top tier service throughout our time here! I got the soufflegg skillet which was MASSIVE! It was piping hot, and had the perfect amount of veggies. The eggs were so fluffy I didn't feel overly full. Can we get an applause for the potatoes?! They were some of the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had. They were crispy, bite size, and perfectly seasoned. I would honestly come here just for then potatoes although everything was incredible. We got the millionaires bacon. It's was rich with maple and a hint of savory salt and spices! My friend  who lives in the area but couldn't make it, made it a point to tell us to get their bacon. For good reason! To pair with our meals, my fiancé got the hot cocoa and I got the lavender latte! If you're looking for a fun feel good modern twist on classic breakfast, sweet maple is your spot! :),Such a great food place to be, went in at a perfect time when there is no rush. Gets really busy during the brunch time, they do also have outdoor seating, feels a bit cold but they do have heaters outside. Had a really good brunch after epic and unbelievable soccer final game. The food here is very delicious and the staff are very friendly. Get in the line before 10:30 or the line gets bigger. Parking is a bit tricky because street parking is hard during peak hours and especially on the weekends. But down by two blocks, can be able to find parking.,My friends and I were visiting from LA and wanted to try a local brunch spot. We came across this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. Everything on the menu looked tempting! We came around 10am, so it was peak brunch hours and there was a wait. At first, there wasn't a line but after spending a few minutes looking for parking, a line formed. I'd recommend someone from your party going in line and putting your name down while the others go look for parking. We weren't picky with where we sat so we got seated right away even though we were a group of 5. Parking: street parking mostly, unless you don't mind walking from the nearest parking garage. Street parking was free in some areas, so just drive around and check. I believe the spots on the actual street of the restaurant are metered, so just beware and follow the rules posted. Ambiance: there's both indoor and outdoor seating, but their outdoor seating isn't bad at all. Since we came during a cold time, they turned on the heaters outside and it felt good, especially with the sun there too. It's busy indoors and noisy, but that's expected and idm.  Service: the waiters and waitresses were all very accommodating and followed through with our dietary requests. Everything came out in a timely manner and everyone was super friendly. Food: ahh yes, the real reason to write a review. We tried stuff from different parts of the menu and we were all satisfied. I ordered the swedish pancakes with some berries on top, and eggs + sausage on the side. Their chicken mango sausage is DELICIOUS!! I wish I ordered a whole plate of just that. It's something I personally haven't tasted before, and not too overwhelmingly sweet for a sausage. The pancakes were also a perfect thin texture and not too chewy. They were also a perfect sweetness with just the berries because I didn't need to add any syrup or butter.,This place is old fashioned where they require you to stand in line instead of having a waitlist. Seems a bit troublesome honestly in this day and age. We came on a Saturday around 930 and the wait was less than 30 minutes. The later it got, the longer the line became. savory soufflegg skillets - steamed egg is always delicious and this place did it well. it's not particularly fancy or anything but a nice alternative to the normal egg dishesBlackstone benedict - the bacon was not very warm when this dish came out. a bit disappointing as it was also a bit tough. benedict done really well and quite runny. Enjoyed the sweet potato tater puffs as they taste really healthy.,===TL;DR===- Organic soy lavender coffee - Mariner French Toast - Open Face - healthy choice combo - Florentine Benedict - Expect a line! ===TMI===Finally got to try this place out... just when you thought you've tried enough brunch places and think... they're all the same. Nope, not Sweet Maple. They literally nail their food just right. Surprised on my order - the lavender coffee was surprisingly good... took a chance with it and left content. The ""open face"", SO. BOMB. If you're a fan of lox bagels... salmon Benedict's, this is that 2.0. Oh, come early or be prepared to line up because it's still THAT poppin.,Brunch? Bottomless mimosas? Solid menu? Come to this place. Now.The line was lengthy and we got here around 11AM or so on a Sunday. There are tables outside with patio heaters so we opted for that rather than waiting for a table inside.We went for the bottomless mimosas. They had a ton of different flavors. We tried the mango tajin and regular. Regular was what we liked the best.The food was incredibly good. The menu was extensive to cater to everyone.I went with the asparagus omelette and it had asparagus and their Millionaire Bacon along with cheese and other stuff. The potatoes were super crispy. I really enjoyed the bread it came with. I slathered some butter on it and bit into it thinking it would be hard and crusty. It was super soft and flaky. I'd come here just for that if I could.Brother in law got a benedict with the Millionaire Bacon and he said it was probably the best bacon he's had. My other friend got a rice/omelette dish that he enjoyed as well. And well enjoyed the mimosas for sure.I definitely recommend this place for brunch. A bit of a wait, but well worth it.,My friend and I had eaten here last month. She's from out of town and chose this place out of a list I'd given her. It was a good choice! Everyone had to sit outside for either an event inside or they were fixing something. Luckily it was the warmest day of the week (think 75-80°) and the sun just warmed up our spirits. Our waiter was nice and good with the service. I had ordered a Strawberry Mimosa and Hemingway Benedict; while she had Orange Juice and the Athenian Omelet. Both came with sides of potatoes and hers toast with butter. We both enjoyed our dishes. They were big portions and had a lot of flavor. We also shared the Millionaire's Bacon Sample Platter. It's a nice treat when you go out for brunch. I can't tell a huge difference between the flavors but I can tell you that it's delicious! Savory and smoky is a perfect combo.,I loved the ambience. The restaurant was quite busy.I ordered mushroom meat sandwich. (Didn't have too many vegetarian eggless options) and my friend ordered an omelette. I ordered a mocha which was good. The presentation is really good. The food was decent. Not worth the hype though. The Service was great. It is a little pricey though.,I usually go to the Palo Alto location but decided to try this one out for Sunday brunch! I think the biggest difference would be the actual items on the menu. I usually get the tornado galbi omurice from Palo Alto and would guess that the closest item in the SF location would be the SM omurice. The Benedicts are all pretty solid! I love the Hemingway and the Florentine. I would def recommend trying their sweet potato tater tots instead of their potato medley for a nice sweet and salty combo for brunch! Would definitely say that their breakfast brunch menu is more traditional breakfast leaning compared to the Palo Alto location- which in my opinion has a lot more Asian fusion menu items. Highly recommend coming here for a cute brunch date with friends or family!,My experience here was pretty good. The restaurant is in a quaint area in San Francisco and has a nice ambiance. The menu is fun, with a few unique items I have not seen elsewhere. The servers were kind, and we were served quickly! If you are in the area, it's a worthy breakfast spot!Order: My mom got the Oscar Benedict Breakfast which was large and filling. The crab was fresh and yummy. I got the Francis Soufflegg Skillet w/ Sweet Potato Tater Puffs which was pretty yummy but unfortunately lacking flavor. I added gochujang to the soufflegg, and it was pretty good. We shared the Millionaire's Bacon which was not bad but wayyyyy overpriced, in my opinion.,One of my favorite spots in SF The food is amazing and the service even better.My server was so friendly and helpful, our Coffee cup was never empty! We order the Mariner FT, and the Big Hip FT super delicious.,If there's one place that is always a crowd pleaser for brunch, Sweet Maple continues to be it. However, my last couple experiences have left a little bit to be desired. This review is for my past couple times I've been here. They've added some test kitchen items, and I tried the souffle egg skillet with shrimp. Can't recommend this. While the first couple bites were good, it quickly turned into nothing but a burnt taste/flavor, pretty much inedible. When I brought this up to the server, I was told that the cast iron is hot, so I need to eat it faster lol. Haha ok, for $26 this was a huge miss, and imma stick to the regular shrimp omelette.Next time around a couple friends wanted to meet here, and I got the chicken panini. $20 for chicken panini and side salad while steep better be good, however it was mid. Sauces were good, but the chicken itself was mad dry. Needed an extra side of mayo to get through it. Again, it was a lesson, stick with breakfast lol I was really excited for bottomless mimosas but was denied when one person in our group of 3 wanted rosè instead. You know what you call brunch without mimosas? Breakfast. The rule is everyone at the table has to order bottomless or nobody is allowed to get it. Even with my friend ordering an entire bottle of rosè, the only solution was to pay per glass ($12 each or bottomless is $23). I understand it's stated on the menu, but there's gotta be some wiggle room in that policy, especially if someone is buying a bottle for $39. Overall, I'll still recommend Sweet Maple bc for the most part the food is good but I'm not rushing to go back as quickly like I used to.,We came here late afternoon on a weekday close to closing time after a hike in the Muir Woods area so we were starving as expected. We were seated inside since they were closing up the outdoor seating. Coming to the food, everything tasted amazing. The millionaire's bacon is divine!!! We got 2 of their rice dishes served with eggs and boy the flavors on those were on point!!! Everything tasted great and the service was good. If I'm in the area again I'd definitely revisit for the bacon!!,My mom and I were visiting the city on a weekday and I know the line for this restaurant is usually really long so we decided to stop by when there wouldn't be too much of a line. I think the wait was about 20 minutes. I got the shin fried rice as well as the chicken mango sausage ciabatta sandwich. I would rate the fried rice a 10/10 - it's amazing how they incorporate the ramen seasoning into the fried rice. Also, the sausage worked well with the sandwich so we enjoyed that. I don't know if the wait would be worth it on the weekends but I'm definitely glad I stopped by!,Came here on Labor Day and there was a wait around 11am. Luckily we were able to snag seats at the bar and got seated right away.We got an americano, dirty chai tea latte (w espresso not soju haha!), the Millionaire's Bacon Sampler Platter, the Hemingway benedict, and big hip. Super heavy breakfast!! The sample platter was really good, I liked the citron and regular bacon the best. The cinnamon almost reminded me of a sweet jerky. The rosemary flavor was not bad too. The Hemingway benedict was very interesting with the cucumber wasabi hollandaise. This tasted exactly like what it was! The big hip was way too sweet for my taste. I did like the pork lime sausage. Great service as well!,This was our last minute change in plan to go to this place for brunch. We arrived before 10am on Sunday and right before the line started getting longer. We got seated after 10 mins and started to order.- SM Omurice: our favorite item of the meal. My bf was not into rice for brunch but he was the one ordering it. It's different from what I expected for omurice, but I guess this is a fusion version of it serving with potato and sweet potato. I know it sounds like a lot of carbs, but you won't regret it.- Soufflegg Skillet - Gardena: fusion version of gyeranjjim - Korean steamed eggs and they added toppings. It's definitely a lighter option for brunch compared to rice or pancake if you don't wanna feel heavy after the meal. It tastes ok, a bit bland and you need to add some chili sauce or pepper. We had the option with veggies only but you can choose the other 2 options with bacon or chicken.- Millionaire's Bacon Sampler Platter: we had millionaires bacon before but didn't really try different flavors so this was a blast. They served you Original, Citron, Cinnamon and Rosemary. My favorite was Rosemary and Cinnamon, adding a bit flavor to the bacon.This place opens from 8am so I'd suggest getting there as early as you can. You might have to wait for a long time when it starts to peak up around brunch and lunch time. The waiting time for your order can be long too since they're pretty busy. I wanted to try the Chicken Croffle but they don't have it in SF location, which is a bummer.,Came in on a Tuesday  and we we're not expecting to get seated as fast as we did.  Sweet maple was super cute! Loved the ambience and the light fixtures. The employees greeted us and were super friendly. We had to try the millionaires bacon. It came with a citron, regular, rosemary and cinnamon flavor. My husband and I like the original and surprisingly the cinnamon. The hip French toast came out just at the right texture. I  added banana and candied walnuts but it was a treat! My husband loved the soufflegg. The savory was tasty, but a tad too salty for me. My husband loved it. The potatoes that came with the dish were super crunchy and fresh. Street parking was readily available. They have multiple beware theft signs so be cautious. The restaurant had 2 clean bathrooms which I really appreciated! Overall we had a good experience and enjoyed brunch!,TLDR: It's okay. You could probably make better food at home with a little bit of effort. The wait was not as much of an issue as we thought when we arrived- we were a table for 2 and waited 15-20mins to be seated. We did have to wait a bit in order to get service from a waiter after seating.The eggs Benedict and the bulgogi scramble both needed a ton of salt. The scramble was watery as well. The potato medley was very good on the side however.Overall we were pretty disappointed because Berkeley Social Club is one of our favorite spots, and this seems to be under the same owner/management. I would much rather do the Bart ride all the way to Berkeley than dine here again.,Came here on a Saturday for a solo brunch and lovedddd it! There was a pretty long line wrapping around the corner but since I was alone I got to skip the line for the empty bar seat. Their menu has a fusion style going on but I'm not 100% sure what it's supposed to be influenced by. I ordered the omurice, a matcha latte and the veuve. I was looking forward to a bloody, but this is a beer/wine only spot so their bloodies are made with soju which is not my thing. The omurice was amazing especially with the dank sriracha gravy and fluffy eggs. The matcha was also one of the best matches I've had in a while. I had it with oat milk and it was still nice and foamy! I would definitely recommend but suggest going early to skip the line.,This place is great. The line was long but goes by really fast, the mimosas selection is great as they have multiple flavors. Turkey panini is good but wanted a little bit more food for the price. Overall a great place for a brunch, lunch, and especially anything when you go with a group,Sweet maple what an amazing breakfast spot in downtown SF! The food is delicious, the service was quick and good, and the ambiance was also really nice. We loved the millionaires bacon and the French toast! We got the deep fried one but next time I think we would just get the regular one. Still an overall awesome breakfast experience and we would definitely love to come here again!!,As I had mentioned at other breakfast reviews...I am not a big breakfast person so when I find a place with non-typical breakfast offerings, I'm very happy.In line with that, I had the SM Omurice. Having rice for breakfast just puts a smile on my face...and of course, I enjoyed it very much. My husband had the Swedish Maple Plate with a Complete Meal. The Swedish pancakes were a little different..not fuffly...thin and chewy...not bad...just different.The Pimped Shin Cupbop looked very intriguing. I love Shin Ramyun I was very tempted to try it but will have to wait for the next time we visit.,Initially we were intimidated by the line. It was wrapped. The waitress came around and asked seating preference and we opted for outside as they have heaters. We were sat in no time!! We had the SM Ourice, bay omelet, the Californian, strawberry and mango mimosas. The SM Ourice was a very unique pairing. Scrambled eggs over spinach, rice and bulgogi, potatoes, topped with a Sriracha demiglace and eel sauce--AMAZING. The omelet was filled with Dungeness crab and the burger and their guacamole-WHEWWWW!!! Can't wait to go back here.,Don't let the pictures fool you, its not what I would call the most aesthetic brunch but it is quite tasty! I can see why this is so popular. We got lucky cause we got seated right away, no wait on a saturday. Highly recommend the Fresh toast! This is like the gold standard, idk whats their secret but it is unlike any other french toast I've tried. Definitely get millionaires bacon too because it is so thicc and flavorful. My partner enjoyed his omelette (I'm not a big omelette person but I appreciated the amount of avocado). The only thing that could use improvement is service, they don't really check up on you so don't come here thirsty.,Been wanting to try this place out for a while and am so glad we finally got the chance!We arrived around 9:30AM on a Saturday and the line to enter was already starting to get long. Thankfully we got seated relatively quickly and ordered the Chicken Rancheros, The Frisco Omelette, Crab Benedict, and the Deep Fried French toast. Everyone loved their dishes and thought the flavors were well balanced and perfectly cooked! My friends also ordered the bloody Mary which they mentioned was really well made.Overall, this place has a really great variety of dishes for any type of diet (since I'm on a cut) which I'm very thankful for. I would definitely return again to try some more dishes!,Oh my sweet sweet sweet maple !!! This was the first brunch I had after moving to the city, and boy did it really impress me. Made me realize the brunch scene in SF is legit (and I moved from D.C. aka the epicenter of amazing brunches). It was really cool to see the unique dishes in the test kitchen menu section such as the Pimped Shin Cupbop, SM Omurice, and Morning Tacos. I also loved how there is a touch of Asian influence! Now for a few words about the Pimped Shin Cupbop: incredible, mouthwatering, spectacular, 10/10. Topped with a fried egg and Millionaire's Bacon (sent from the heavens), the rice was SO flavorful and not too dry, plus had awesome looking presentation with the branded shin ramen cup.Don't be scared by the long line on weekends - it goes by quickly and you'll be eating delicious brunch food in no time!,Good breakfast place. Tried Millionaire bacon which was super tasty! South of the border was really good and the potato was crispy and yummy tasting. The pancakes were super good! The OJ was fresh but not the best probably the only thing we didn't like as much. Service was fast staff was very attentive. Parking wasn't too basic we found one right away. Overall it was a good restaurant would definitely reccomend.,i've always wanted to come here but there's alwayyyys a long line!! but i got very lucky coming here on a random thursday after a doctors appointment :) i got the pimped shin cup bop and it was so good. It's also a great amount of food so i took it to go and my leftovers were just as delish. so happy i got to come here. the only thing i wasn't a fan of was the candy bacon we got-- but everything else outweighed it. will definitely come back!,Absolutely great brunch spot in San Francisco! I've had this spot several times, and it consistently delivers each time. They usually have a wait on weekend, but it moves relatively quickly. I was there last weekend on a Sunday at around 1 pm for a party of 4, and we were seated within about 15 minutes. They do require the whole party to be seated. The dishes here are delicious! I've ordered the Pimped Shin Cupbop before and the SM Omurice. Both are definitely unique dishes. The cupbop is basically fried rice with an egg and bacon, but the presentation is very unique. The omurice is pretty delicious! A fluffy egg with fried rice. Both are very filling dishes - last time, I had plenty of food left over. They're famous for their Millionaire's Bacon, so definitely give it a try if you haven't! It's very flavorful and different from typical bacon. Overall would definitely recommend Sweet Maple, especially to impress a friend out of town. They do have a bottomless brunch deal, and is a delicious spot!,I've heard of the crazy lines during the weekends, so my friend and I opted to come on a Friday morning around 11am, and we were seated at the last open table, so it'd be hard to get seated for larger parties. They're known for their millionaires bacon, but my friend is a vegetarian so I knew I wouldn't be able to finish it. Instead, I ordered their Blackstone Benedict, because they use a piece of millionaires bacon in it. It was amazing. My vegetarian friend said his vegetarian omelet was just okay and was a bit overpriced, so maybe not the best vegetarian option for omelets here?,I was in San Francisco for a 3 night trip and we came here for brunch twice! So glad I found this on Yelp because it's a gem! Their candied bacon is spectacular. On the first day we got the Blackstone Benedict's and the Big Hip (deep fried French toast). Both soooooo good. The Big Hip was my favorite.

outside and soft on the inside. Definitely recommend getting that! It's a good choice to share with the table. Our second day I got the Millionare's Melt. My friends got an omelette and Pimped Shin Cupbop. & we got the Big Hip to share, bc it was just that good! Loved the Millionaire's Melt. It was a perfect mix of sweet & savory. It comes with a salad or fries.This will be a mandatory stop on my next trip to San Francisco! Service was fast and always friendly. Great environment.,Awesome brunch options, excellent service. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but my favorite was the Shin Cupbop. Bottomless brunch is worth it and there are plenty of flavors, including pink lemonade which I don't usually see! There isn't an online waitlist, but rather a physical line. So get there early.,Is the long line worth it? YES! Everything about this place was great! I do suggest going early or during middle of meal times like in between lunch-dinner. Here's what we ordered BlackstoneBig HipBulgogiFriscoHemingwayMillionaire's Bacon sampler Savory - egg soufflé The coconut cream latte was great too! The service was attentive and really great - regardless of how insanely busy they were! Yes the line is long - but the food is worth it. They don't take reservations and everyone just stands in a line so it can be a long wait. I've come here a few times as well as taken people from out of town here and they all loved it! Excited for their new location!,I usually order to go because of the wait time but today I dined in since there was no line. Here was the experience:- Marnier with Banana and Walnuts ($18) : Moist French toast with strawberries and syrup. I ordered this with banana and walnut for an additional $4. Highly recommend this as a combo - Blackstone ($25) : 2 eggs, millionaire's bacon, potatoes, English muffin, asparagus .. this was good and my first time trying millionaire's bacon. It reminded me of jerky but it was good with the sauce. The eggs were the perfect bite with the asparagus and sauce. - Strawberry Milky ($7) : I thought this was a milkshake and by the way I saw the photo they advertised, the red you see are NOT strawberries and are candy. This was disappointing and seems more of a treat for kids. There's zero strawberries and extremely sweet and sugary. I DO NOT recommend this item... it's better to stick with your water lol.The food was great aside from the drink. I'm giving 3 stars because our server in the beginning was rude. I thought it was her accent so I didn't mind but turns out it's her unnecessary attitude. She kept on rushing us multiple times to order our food when we've just sat down. I believe she ended up going on break cause I didn't see the server anymore and someone else took over. Everyone else was very nice. Unfortunately her rudeness ruined our dining experience so I recommend avoiding her or take your food to go.,Wow. I love San Francisco brunch. And this place is definitely in the top tier! Special mention: the millionaire's bacon. Glazed and thick cut and oh-so-good. I got the Blackstone Eggs Benedict and shared the Swedish pancakes with a friend (we were both ravenous). The eggs were absolutely delicious!!! Came with the millionaire's bacon, asparagus, and cherry tomatoes; so many flavors, textures, wow. And it came with a colorful set of roasted potatoes, which were also quite yummy. A feast for the eyes as much as for the stomach, I'd order it again in a heartbeat; a true delight to eat. The pancakes were underwhelming, though. They were thin and spongey, and a bit bland. Had to soak them in the maple syrup and butter to make them taste good. Another small point; both the table and my water cup were not entirely clean. But easily remedied!,Another 5-star review for the Sweet Maple family of restaurants. I was in SF with a couple of girlfriends who hd not tried any of the Sweet Maple restaurants and wanted them to try it. I was thrilled to see how much they loved the experience.Got there around 1:30PM on a Sunday and there were about 10 people ahead of us. It took about 15 minutes to get seated. Not bad at all...This location is spacious and has a beautiful comfortable setting inside.  We started with our wonderful match and coffee orders, followed by salmon Benedict, pizza and Grand Marniere French toast. Of course you can't come here without trying the millionaire's Bacon. Everything was absolutely delicious, flavorful and unique... just couldn't stop stuffing ourselves. It was absolutely delicious!!!Just keep in mind for larger parties, they only accept two credit cards to split the bill.,The Blackstone (asparagus eggs Benedict with millionaires bacon) was incredible. Their portions are large enough for two people. The food was prepared very quickly, but be prepared to wait in line to be seated. All the items on the menu look delicious.,The service in this restaurant was excellent. I would give it 5 stars for that. We had a party of 6, which can be relatively large in a small and crowded setting, but we were sat down in 15 minutes or less. A few groups of 2 went ahead of us, but obviously that was no problem since there are lots of smaller tables and less large ones. Because it was so crowded, it was insanely noisy. I could barely hear the waiter, who has a soft voice, and it was hard to make conversation without talking very loudly. The food was not only expensive, but it wasn't extraordinary. It seems like a lot of people go here for the bacon, which most of my family doesn't eat pork. The one who did get pork sausage said it had an odd taste. I got the deep fried French toast, which was actually a deep fried pancake it seems. Tasted kinda like a funnel cake, which is fine. Another person in our party got a coconut coffee, which ended up being $9. Kind of ridiculous considering it was just a small mug containing a latte. With taxes, and automatic 20% gratuity, our meal ended up being $214. I don't eat out in larger cities much, so maybe I'm just delusional, but that seems like an awful lot for just breakfast food. Nothing here was bad by any means, so I would give it a chance and see what you think.,came here for breakfast with a few friends, got in around 9 so we were seated immediately. I ordered the Frisco Scramble, pretty standard but solid egg scramble with cheese, mushrooms and chicken sausage. We also shared the blueberry mochi waffle - loved this one!!,Best breakfast I have ever had in the city! I came here based on my bookmarks that's been siting there for a few years now and today was the right opportunity for me to try it out for the first time. And it deserves every star it can get!  We ordered the bacon sampler, crab Benedict, bugoochi with egg white and millionaire Bloody Mary. The bacon is a little pricy and the Bloody Mary was well worth it as it also have a big piece of bacon in it! We were so happy how everything to end out!  I will definitely come back again!,Today was my second visit to Sweet Maple and this time around was as good as the first. While menu prices are on what I would consider the higher end for breakfast, Sweet Maple definitely delivers on flavor and portion size for the price. There will be a line when you arrive, but at 10:30AM on a Saturday it only took about 20 minutes for a party of two. If you are flexible on seating it's a little faster. You can't go wrong with either the Marnier French toast or the Hass Omelette. And sure, why not try that pumpkin spice latte while it's in season?,One of my favorite brunch spot in the city! Loved the service and we got our food in a timely manner. The Gardena was delicious but gotta be careful because it's piping hot when it comes out. Came with a good amount of veggies. I didn't end up finishing this dish because the egg was a bit too salty towards the end when I ran out of bread (saltiness seems to be a common trend among the sister restaurants Kitchen Story/Surisan/Blackwood). Potatoes were great. The other dishes my friends ordered looked amazing and I'm sure it was just as delicious. We sat outside so it was actually pretty hot on a nice day. It would be nice if there was an awning to provide shade. Parking is a bit difficult in this area (I settled for the metered parking) and full party must be present to be seated.,Sweet Maple has quickly become my favorite brunch spot in the city thanks to its atmosphere, excellent service despite the busy staff, and of course, amazing food!My friends and I had to wait in line for approximately 15 minutes, but honestly the line disappeared way faster than we had expected. Once seated, we quickly got to ordering and didn't have to wait too long at all before our dishes wee piping hot in front of us. Personally, I ordered the Hip which was essentially a giant, deep fried French Toast and it was amazing. Absolutely amazing. It did somewhat feel like it was turning my blood into syrup, but whoever thought it was a good idea to deep fry a French toast definitely knew what they were doing. Despite how unhealthy it may sound and seem, it is an absolute killer to eat and I would get it again with no regrets. The eggs Benedict were also super solid, but felt more like standard eggs Benedict rather than something truly unique like the Hip!Overall, Sweet Maple is a superb brunch spot and should definitely be number one on your list for brunch places to try in SF!,I've been to San Francisco a few times, but my most recent trip was my first time going to Sweet Maple.  I ended up coming 2 times within 3 days.  I am a little obsessed with this place.  First Visit (Sunday)I came alone on my first visit and sat at their breakfast bar area.  I came closer to 9am and there were still plenty of empty tables.  Since this place is walk in's only, I would imagine there may be a wait at times, so I would allow time.  The Sweet Maple employees were all really nice and helpful.  I was originally coming to have a light brunch, but that did not happen at all.  I ordered the Gardena Egg Soufflé egg Skillet and really liked it.  I also ordered a side of their millionaires bacon.  This bacon is worth trying at least once.  Second VisitI came on a weekday morning with my husband.  The Matcha Latte was one of the best I've ever had.  Very well balanced.  I ordered the Mariner French Toast for brunch and loved it.,My cousin moved a couple minutes away and suggested to eat here for brunch. The wait was per long on a weekend (but what other place is not in the city). Overall food was delicious and service was,Love the breakfast and coffee here! Always plan to head there earlier in the day or expect to wait 40min-1 hr in line during the weekends.,I think Sweet Maple has now become our spot for the New Year!Blackstone Benedict: I've been getting this every time I'm here! Super delicious and filling. Beautifully plated. It could use a little more sauce, but still delicious.I also tried another location, but there's just something different about it. I couldn't finish it, but I can here! :p,Haven't been here in ages! Decided to come here for brunch since we had a large group and there seemed to be a lot of seating. Came at around 11AM and there was already a long line. Line was pretty quick as the staff at Sweet Maple was really efficient and turned over tables really fast. They only sit full parties though so make sure everyone has arrived or you will be skipped. Menu is on a QR code on the table. It's basically the same menu on their website. Sweet Maple has a lot of variety in their menu and it was really hard to choose. Ordered the Blackstone Benedict. Blackstone was REALLY good. The egg yolk was a little bit too runny for my taste but that's mostly preference. The side of potatoes and two orange slices were nice. Could barely finish it as it's a LOT of food. Price is on par with other brunch places in SF. Staff was super attentive throughout the meal. Definitely will come back here when I have a large group.,There is a easy way to sign up for the Yelp waiting list online, so make sure to register your names ahead of time! I ordered takeout in person, since I was near a fire. The lady said it would be about 20 minutes and I waited about 15 minutes for my Matcha mochi waffles! They were delicious, slightly crispy and the strawberries were fresh! The Matcha dipping sauce was simply superb! I will definitely be back again and order ahead of time so I don't have to wait quite as long for my food. But everything was very clean and organized! Crazy to see so many people here on a Monday morning at 11:30 AM! Lol,This place is loved by locals and visitors alike -- that's why you'll often see a long time outside the door. But it's worth it! They don't take reservations so plan on long waits or coming at an off-peak time. The most famous item on the menu is the Millionaire's Bacon and it really is that delicious. It's high quality, thick cut bacon with the perfect blend of sweet, spicy, salty and fatty. If you've made it here and eat meat, you have to try it. I've been to Sweet Maple a couple of times. For this visit, I got the Two Eggs Any Style w/ Millionaire's Bacon. It comes with a potato medley, bread and a little piece of fruit. I'm gluten free and unfortunately the bread could only be substituted for a $3 fee, which I found really steep. I got my eggs poached and they were just okay. The bacon was as incredible as ever. The potato medley is very tasty as well -- a great mixture of potato varieties, crispy outside with soft inside and a tasty thyme herb seasoning. Given that the eggs were just meh and I couldn't eat the bread, I would maybe consider getting the potatoes and bacon à la carte next time. My husband got the Hemingway Eggs Benedict. I couldn't eat the English muffin, but I did try the rest and wow -- it was SO good! Hollandaise can be such a tricky thing but this one is perfection. The cucumber wasabi hollandaise was so complimentary to the salmon and capers, and not heavy at all. Also, this was really excellent smoked salmon. The service here was really good and attentive. The prices are high but typical for popular SF brunch spots. I would recommend sticking to the classics. Enjoy!,Pump our waiter is AMAZING! Service 5 out of 5 Pump our waiter was soooo attentive, fun, energetic and sweet all in one sitting. Food 10 out of 5 The food is to diiie for. Literally everything on the menu is LEGIT. Get the millionaires bacon platter. Vibe 5 out of 5 Vibes and esthetics 100%,20-30 minute brunch wait at 11 am on a Sunday morning??? Yes, it's an accurate representation of the wait time! I called Sweet Maple to get an estimated wait prior to arriving and that's exactly what they told me. Then I pulled up to the joint to see the worlds longest line.... But the wait time is accurate, we only waited in line for 30 minutes! You can not call in to put your name down and they do not take reservations. Parking was shockingly easy to find on the street and because it was Sunday it was free!!! We secured a parking less than a block away. I am not sure if it is always like that. Food was good, but nothing special. Frisco scramble - 9/10: the best thing we ordered! It was super cheesy and a good portion for 1 hungry person or 2 half hungry people. Super delish would get again. 2 eggs breakfast with bacon - 9/10: your typical bacon and eggs," nothing to complain about. But the toast was AMAZING! I could rave about this forever. Big hip - 5/10: This was not what I was expecting at all. The edges were extremely hard and it was hard to find the """"French toast"""" in it. It felt really heavy and fried like something from a carnival. It was super disappointing. Would opt for the regular French toast next time.",Sweet Maple Ratings: 4.3/5 Food: 4.75/5 - Brunch here was satisfying and delicious. My boyfriend took me here, and I was surprisingly pleased with the Blackstone Benedict. Actually, I loved it. I was skeptical at first, but they definitely worth the hype and all the high ratings. You can see the descriptions of the brunch items we got below.- Blackstone Benedict [GET]: I haven't had a delicious benedict like this one in a very long time. The benedict comes with roughly two thick stripes of their famous Millionaire's bacon on a bed of asparagus and cherry tomatoes drizzled with Meyer lemon hollandaise sauce. The bacon is thick, sweet, candied beautifully, and delicious. It has a beef jerky kind of feel and texture to it, chewy and crispy. All the ingredients and flavors combined made it fantastic! The potato medley on the side was unique. It consists of regular, sweet, and purple potatoes, but I wished it was roasted longer and crispier; it was a bit mushy in texture and greasy. - Californian Burger [GET]: My boyfriend got the California burger, a deviation from a classic burger, and comes on a nicely toasted bun. The 1/2lb grass fed burger is well-seasoned and grilled to medium rare combined with shallots, tomato, arugula, guacamole, Monterey jack, and aioli. This gourmet burger was juicy, moist, and yummy with just the right toppings on it. My boyfriend loves it. He opted the sides for the crispy potato wedges, and they blew my mind. It was better than the potato medley. It was fried nicely, crispy exterior with a fluffy and soft interior, perfectly seasoned and pairs well with their homemade ketchup on the side. Ambiance: 4.25/5 - Neighborhood and surrounding is great and has a pleasant outdoor dining area, but we requested to sit indoor. There's a full cocktail bar and a semi-open kitchen too. The ambiance is causal, chill, and casual, perfect for weekend brunch with friends or love ones. I love the huge magnolia painting on the wall, so beautiful and lovely. It is packed, so we are cramped and sit pretty close to other tables, and expect it to be loud. Price: 4/5 - The prices here are higher than other brunch places. The Blackstone Benedict was $24 and the Californian Burger was $19 all pre-tax. There's SF employee benefit mandate included as well. The portions are generous though, lasting me full for a very long time. Worth it if you never tried their famous bacon. Service: 4/5 - They do not take reservation, but we only waited for 15 to 20 minutes on a Saturday, so not too bad. Great customer service, our server was quick at filling up our water and checking in with us. Food came out quick with pretty presentation, so I was impressed. All staffs are welcoming, nice, and friendly despite it being super busy, definitely well-trained and knows how to take care of their customers. BLUF: Neighborhood favorite and a classic brunch place. The best thing here you can get is the Millionaire's bacon, perfectly seasoned with an amazing texture, so I highly recommend ordering the Millionaire's bacon sampler. As for sides, get the potato wedges or the sweet potato totes. I will return to their sister restaurants to try out their other items on the menu next time.,Went here for brunch with two girlfriends on Sunday. Wait was about 20 mins and food came pretty quick. Staff was nice and very busy but did check on us. Food was amazing and I can't wait to go back.,It is no wonder Sweet Water had so many amazing reviews. The portions are large and delicious. The line was long but it moved quickly. We waited no more than 20 minutes. And were seated on the patio. We started with beverages, I got the coconut cream latte which has no coffee in it was very coconut flavored  and smooth. My husband got and ice coffee. We then got the Millionaire Bacon sampler which was way too expensive but what they are known for so we had to try it. The original and the rosemary were my favorite. I tried a dish off the test kitchen menu while my husband opted for a scramble. Both were delicious and flavorful and extremely large portions but the fruit and the potatoes were the best tasting items. Next time I would try a sweet dish like the fried pancakes. Go if you get a chance.,Busy for breakfast and lunch. Sometimes if you time it right you can walk right in. And pandemic era they've expanded their dining space to include outdoor parklets making the restaurant more inviting for pet owners and  larger groups. Portions are on the generous side. Omelettes come in a variety of offerings. Eggs Benedict also with many options. Potato medley resemble home fries; mixed potatoes.Million dollar bacon is a must order. The flavors and seasoning superb. The bar has a few offerings beer and wine cocktails. Single stall gendered bathrooms are tucked away behind the bar area. Pro tip: walk or use public transit to get here. Parking is extremely limited and costly in nearby hospital garages,There isn't much that hasn't already been said about Sweet Maple, so to add:- there was no wait on a Monday (indigenous peoples day) around 12:30- loved the Swedish pancakes and shin ramen fried rice- attentive service,This place never fails to be amazing every time I go! When someone visits me from out of town this is one of the must places to eat at. Service is always amazing and going around 12-2 on a weekday would get you seated right away (most of the time)Their mimosas are so delicious and they have very unique flavors! Also if you haven't tried it get the bacon platter, it's totally worth it!! Their egg Benedict's are super delicious and so is their lunch options! I also love their salad and their potatoes! Will be coming back soon! Lol,Dined at this restaurant on Christmas Day and it was the perfect brunch spot . Food was delicious and the staff was so fun and welcoming. Tried the S OMURICE with ribeye that was really tasty and the MILLIONAIRE BACON was also very flavorful. The SOUTH OF THE BORDER SCRAMBLE was also excellent .,Stopped by early on a Sunday with a friend and I got the marnier maple plate with the side of millionaire's bacon. The marnier was nice and fluffy and the bacon was sweet and spicy. The scene stealer, though, were the scrambled eggs - they were so tasty and delicious! If I could order just a huge bowl of sweet maple's scrambled eggs, I would!,I only write reviews when the food moves me... and Sweet Maple moved me to another state. This is the type of place you bring your friends when they come to visit, because they'll never have food like this again. We shared the soufflé skillet, the deep fried French toast, and the millionaire bacon. All highly recommended. The soufflé skillet is just like the soufflé eggs you get at a KBBQ place, except this one was filled with shrimp, bacon, and perfect seasoning. It came out fluffy and jiggly. Perfect. The deep fried French toast was crispy, sweet, and a perfect complement to the savory soufflé. And of course their millionaire bacon was a thick cut of flavorful, sticky bacon with a little kick of spice. The fact that the restaurant was packed, and everyone around us was enjoying their food is a testament to this restaurant. The wait-staff was great. And I would come to this place over and over again.,My wife was looking for a great place for brunch and Sweet Maple had some great reviews on Yelp. The Yelpers were spot on!We were a little worried about the wait to be seated as the line was was about 15 people deep but it moved pretty quickly as we were seated in around 20 minutes. My wife enjoyed the Swedish Buttermilk thin pancakes which were so light at tasty with a few strawberries and blueberries on top. I had the Millionaire Melt. That bacon was thick and meaty!We were so amazed at how quickly the delicious dishes were prepared and served to us. It felt like only 10 minutes. The service was friendly and fantastic. We will definitely be back:),Walked in to grab a table for two. It's required that everyone in the party be present. Once my friend arrived, it wasn't too long until we were able to get a table. We ordered our food and everything was so tasty. Even my poached eggs were wonderfully creamy and tasty. I was a little worried that the bacon was overhyped, but I'm glad I was wrong. Next time, I would want to order the bacon with rice and fried eggs. They were quick with the coffee and water refills. I can appreciate how polite they were at making it clear that we may have overstayed. I would definitely come back and try some other dishes that have the millionaire's bacon in it.,I recently had brunch at Sweet Maple and was blown away by the delicious food and cute presentation. I ordered the french toast, which was a huge portion and incredibly filling. The matcha latte was also amazing, and the panda on top of the drink was a nice touch. The only downside was that we were seated outdoors and only had one outdoor heater next to us, so it got a bit chilly. Otherwise, it was a fantastic experience and I would definitely come back for another brunch date.,Ive be to sweet maple a couple of times.Here's what I love!The line at the door may make you reconsider dining here! But the line moves fast! Anytime I am in SF I have the craving for anything at sweet maple!The bacon is so good here. The French toast is so good.The waffles are good. This place I feel comfortable ordering anything and I loved their mimosas here!I always tell everyone to order here or at least try it once. I appreciate the organization of the staff and team. Every experience has been positive regarding customer service. I absolutely love this place and keep up the great work,Exceptional service, the food is amazing, and you must order the millionaires bacon platter. I would say the best breakfast I have had and definitely recommend going here. Whenever my water got low they instantly topped it off and frequently checked on us. Great restaurant,First place we stopped when visiting San Francisco. We were told this was a neighborhood favorite. Pancakes were average not as thick as I like but i prefer southern style. Eggs were good but the winner was the bacon. Listen when coming here best thing you can get is the bacon. It's a must perfect seasoning and texture. Really good. Definitely a little wait so get there early. Good service from the staff. Definitely check it out Until next review Kisses,Haven't been here in years but seems like brunch is still a hot commodity with this place! My party was sat down quickly& all ordered the strawberry milkshake to satisfy our inner child. I got the egg skillet and I enjoyed the portion. Egg was very fluffy and soft in which I enjoyed with my sourdough slice. Service was very friendly and amazing. I would argue that the price point does discourage me from frequenting often. Ambiance outdoors was very loud but very enjoyable when the day is nice.Parking is very tough around here :/,We came here at 1030 on a Sunday morning for brunch and there was already a line down the block. Don't worry it moves quickly! We were a party of 9. With both indoor and outdoor dining, our hostess was really on the move and determined to get everyone seated in decent timing. Our servers were friendly," welcoming and had great recommendations when we asked. Though it was packed everything was moving rather quickly and smoothly. Our food came out piping hot and everything we got was super delicious. We all tried something different and since everyone had on this """"millionaire's bacon"""" shirt we decided to try it too. Nothing phenomenal and personally very overpriced", but it was thick cut and tasty.,Great place for breakfast, very crowded. Friendly service.Heard about this place , they have a reputation of bacon. Finally have a chance to try. I went there for brunch and it was quite busy. We didn't have to wait long before we got a table. We ordered 2 eggs and bacon and egg Benedict with bacon also. Black coffee and orange juice.Eggs cooked perfectly Bacon very flavorful jerky like.Coffee was hot and service topped it off when lowOrange juice was fresh squeezed sweet with pulpPotato medley on the side was seasoned well and crunchy Love it!!!Overall, great and will definitely comeback If you're morning person , you should check this place out.,3.5~ Woke up early to try this breakfast place. Super busy at 8am but we managed to get seated very fast, which was nice.My partner ordered the eggs Benedict and the French toast, while I ordered the Francis soufflé. The eggs Benedict was good, though I'm not a big fan of hollandaise sauce. I would not get the French toast again - the menu said it was a deep fried, but this tasted more like a regular fried pancake. We got bamboozledThe egg soufflé was served in a cast iron pan, which left a burnt/metal taste (I thought it was interesting). I liked the soufflé because it's an original breakfast item I've never had before.,This restaurant was fantastic. I will say, the line to get in on Sunday around 11am was long, but worth the wait. PLEASE PLEASE GO HERE. It was a typical brunch place, the vibes were cute. Staff was really sweet! We got:Morning Tacos: 8/10 I won't lie, they were super stuffed so I probably looked like an idiot trying to eat these tacos, but they were pretty good! Just wish they were slightly less stuffed. The salsa and potatoes on the side were great.  Mariner Maple Plate with fried banana and candied walnut topping: 10/10 The bananas work so well with the French toast. Absolutely loved it. The only reason I didn't give the last star was because I wish they had a sweet and salty plate/combo. My friend and I got to share our dishes, so we got the best of both worlds, but if that weren't the case I feel like I'd miss out on both types of dishes.,Cyndy's Bottom Line:  For breakfast and bacon lovers *Walk ins welcomed- all parties must be present*They take reservations for groups*Efficient fast service worth the wait*Good breakfast offerings from millionaire bacon to breakfast tacos.*Large portions~An excellent breakfast spot in San Francisco tosatisfy your cravings.~Good coffee~Friendly & efficient service,Sweet Maple is just a few blocks from work. I've walked passed it, but it is usually about to close by the time I take my lunch break. I saw the raving reviews for breakfast, so I decided to come on a weekend. I understand that the line can be long, especially on the weekends, so my husband and I decided to come at opening time (8AM) today (Sunday). We were seated right away. Tip: they do not seat you unless your entire party is present. I don't know if they had physical menus because there is a QR code on the table to pull up the menu on your phone. In my opinion, this is a great paper saver and a good way to keep from spreading germs. We were served right away. The staff is attentive and come by pretty often. This is a plus for my husband who likes his coffee refilled regularly. I read that they move quickly, therefore the wait line moves quickly. Here's what we got: Millionaire's Bacon Sampler Platter ($22) - this was the real reason we wanted to try this place. It is a flight of four pieces, flavored differently.They are thick and tasty. My husband liked the Cinnamon one and the Rosemary equally. I liked the Rosemary the best.Swedish pancakes ($14) w/ fired banana & candied walnuts (+$4). They prepared nicely. The banana and walnuts made it even better. I ate half and took the rest home.Two-egg scramble with bacon/cheddar ($18) -husband enjoyed it. He also only half and took the rest home.Coffee w/ refills ($5)The total for the two us before tip was $75. This includes tax and SF employee benefit mandate. It is a pricey breakfast for two people, but I'm glad we tried it!,This place was amazing. The food was fantastic. Highly recommend. A definite must experience.,Food - delicious!  Lots of flavor combinations for all tastes. Sweet, savory, combo - they got you covered. We had the deep fried French toast (The Hip) and breakfast tacos. I personally loved The Hip, but the hubs felt it was too crispy. He's also the guy who likes his 'toast' totally untoasted, for what it's worth. Tacos were generously filled with meat & eggs.  Potatoes cooked to perfection. Also a WIN!And of course we had to have some Millionaire's bacon, which was worth the $13. You get 2 pieces, which is plenty since it's so rich. It has some kick on the back end to balance the sweet.  Very good indeed. Service was spot on. We were promptly seated and met our server within seconds of being seated. She was knowledgeable, gracious, & engaging in all the right quantities. We were in & out in under an hour, but could have easily hung out longer without feeling rushed. The ambience is nice - well lit, nice modern decor, clean, and comfortable. Totally recommend this place!  Parking on Sunday was simple - just one block away by the park.,Absolutely LOVED this brunch! We came here on a Sunday afternoon as group of 6, so I was very worried about the wait time. To my surprise, we were seated outdoors in just 20 minutes - not bad at all! Sweet Maple's outdoor seating area might not be the cutest, but it's pretty well heated and dog friendly. For my drink, I got the Coconut Cream Latte (sweet but absolutely delicious) and my friends got the Espresso Martini and some of the various mimosas (they have 6 different flavors, many of them pretty unique). They also offer bottomless mimosas for $23/person, but it just wasn't that kind of Sunday for us. For food, I split the Marnier French Toast and Frisco Scramble with one of my friends. Both were absolutely delicious, but the Frisco Scramble was easily my favorite! Such a good combination of flavors, amazing multi-colored potatoes, and even the toast on the side was fantastic - highly highly recommend. The rest of my friends loved their food as well, with the exception of the Snowed Spinach scramble, which fell short unfortunately. Next time, I'd probably try the Hemingway Benedict, which looked incredible (although my friend did mention the english muffin was difficult to cut through). Service was friendly and I was impressed at how quickly out food came out. I would (and will) happily return to Sweet Maple for brunch!,This place has received rave reviews, and we're super excited that it's coming to Silicon Valley.First, no refillable sodas. Only air hand dryers in the bathrooms with no foot door handles. Yuck.We ordered the BEC sandwich (they were out of fries) and the combo with the Millionaire Bacon.If you like spicy bacon, this is the place for you. It's not my preference. The BEC sandwich was ok. Most places give you lots of bread to cut costs, this is of the same ilk.My partner in crime's French toast was yummy.$4 for a can of diet coke was insane and given the quality and quantity of food it was way overpriced. Lots of hype.,I'm taking a star off because it's impossible to get a hold of this restaurant and since our visit I've called and emailed to get a copy of our receipt to expense, and the phone number is out of service and no one has replied in over a week to my email therefore, I am starting my review with this information as I see the owner replies to all reviews here and can hopefully help out with this!As for my actual visit: the food is beyond excellent, the wait was insanely long, the service is good, the atmosphere inside is comfortable, hot drinks were yummy, prices above average. Sunday afternoon wait (during Dreamforce weekend, not sure if that's what caused the delay or if that's usual for this place as we were visiting) was over 45 minutes. Was a tough wait when you're hungry and it's raining but was easier than trying to find somewhere else at that point. After being seated warmly inside and a memorable meal, the wait felt, at least, worth it. Not that I'd be keen to do that again, however. Bill came to approx. $80 for 2 people, a millionaire bacon add-on and no alcohol, pretty high for brunch imo but a nice treat. I like the asian flair to the dishes and the taste was so delicious. I devoured my SM Omurice. The sauce (I would call it a gravy) on this dish was so amazing on top of well-done fluffy thick scrambled, almost omelette-y eggs, rib-eye and fried rice. The meat was flavorful on its own, soft and I like how it was shredded not chunks. The rice was amazing too with spinach. And that was just one side of the plate! I was happy to get one of those fat pieces of bread that I was eyeing through the window while in line, it was so perfectly crisp and underneath was a bed of golden and purple potatoes that were seasoned just right. The cooks definitely know what they are doing flavor and portion wise. I mean it is a lot of food but we were starving and my companion was able to finish off what I didn't. Otherwise, I'd have enough to take half home. We also tried the Grand Marnier French Toast - amazing. Great idea to mix alcohol into the batter, I'm all for it. The flavor was awesome, with some citrus tones and not too sweet. Bread was soft and paired perfectly with the maple syrup, definitely a hit. I'd highly recommend both these dishes. I wasn't feeling the millionaire bacon, I'm not sure if it was just my taste buds that day..just depends what you like. It's very thick, like more so than typical bacon and had sweet and spice to it.  My friend enjoyed it though, said reminded him of jerky. I got a hot chocolate that I loved, the right amount of chocolate powder not overpowering like most diners do and tasted melted marshmallows in there which is the best. Excited to see this restaurant is opening a location in Santa Monica, LA!,Amazing brunch. I ordered a café mocha and the eggs Benedict with the millionaires bacon. Overall the food was fantastic. No wonder this place is so crowded. I arrived at 8:30 AM and the restaurant was almost full inside. By the time that we left around 10 AM we noticed that the line of people outside that were waiting to be seated was huge. There must have been at least 40 people waiting. My only recommendation is that you try to get here as close to 8 AM as possible. The food was delicious. Highly recommended!!!,Service and food  was great .. we  got seated fast and food was brought in a timely matter.. I will definitely be back and try other dishes.,I was visiting my folks back home and they've been raving about this place so we had to check it out. They don't take reservation, so when we pulled up at 1130AM on Sunday, the line was pretty long. Maybe ~25 ppl in front of us, but the line moved relatively quick and we only had to wait for about 30 mins to be seated. I must say, it was worth the wait. You wonder how good the typical brunch items can be, but the thic and juicy millionaires bacon buried under perfectly poached egg with just right amount of sauce... it CAN be that good. The side of potatoes was soft inside but crunch outside. Basically everything you can ask for in breakfast, they came thru with it. The service was on point even with how packed the place was. Definitely will be back.,Finally got to go here! This place has been on my list for a long time. I got to Sweet Maple at 11am cause I know the line can be long. I got in super fast with my party of 4 on a Sunday (about 15-20 min wait). The whole restaurant was packed which gave off a fun vibe.We did bottomless mimosas. We got the spicy and regular mimosas and you can't go wrong with any mimosa flavor. I had the blackstone Benedict. I finally got to try millionaire bacon for the first time and it was delicious. It's slightly sweet and spicy. It paired with with the poached eggs. My friend had the pimped shin cupbob. She said it was so good. The presentation was on point and the fried rice was one of the best she ever had.Definitely one of my all time favorite brunch spots in SF, especially with anyone from out of town who you want to impress. Service was very attentive and nice. Sweet Maple did not disappoint!,What a fun experience I mean Look at oír dishes!!In this morning brunch, we went adventurously into the menu and came out victorious!!We def wanted to taste the Millionaire a bacon, I mean it's on every waiter's t-shirt- lol- so I chose the fried rice with millionaire bacon and an egg. Fried rice for breakfast: YUM!Then we also got the soufflé scrambled with little bacon pieces and that one was another spectacular looking dish! The bread was so good and the seasoning of the potatoes also delish.Cannot complain.Bring a picture of your vaccination card! March 4 and they check! (Kudos) and the line moves quick.Loved our stay: will be back some day...Enjoy!,Omg! The food here is fantastic and the staff is super friendly and they have bottomless mimosas! It gets pretty busy and we did wait in line but the wait was definitely worth it. I had the eggs benedict which were done perfectly, they also have the option to sample the different kinds of bacon they offer and I highly recommend you do so, will definitely be coming back to this wonderful brunch spot when I visit SF.,This place get crowded whenever I dined in. This restaurant is absolutely well-known and amazing as well. The food is so good and has so many wonderful options. Excellent breakfast meals. Its a huge place but good to be early coming here so you can't be part of the long wait line. It feel so satisfying with the food there.Food is 10/10 for me. The place is great too and pleasant ambiance with fantastic service.,We came here to celebrate a very special day and this place was definately the highlight of our day! We enjoyed bottomless coffee (yay!!), delicious food & huge portion sizes! Perfect spot for brunch! We ordered the Millionaire's Bacon (LOVE!!), Deep Fried French Toast (CRUNCHY!!) &  Morning tacos (LOADED!!). Everything was presently beautifully and was delicious!! Their menu is pretty extensive. A bit on the pricier side.There's always a long line outside going down the block so arrive early! There's plenty of street parking.We will definately come back to try the Wagyu Sliders Benerdict!,I've been here 3 times and it hits every time!!!SM Omurice - I come back just for this. Soft egg scramble with delicious gravy and juicy beef mixed with rice. So comforting.Hass omelet - just a simple omelet cooked to perfection :)Bottomless - fun weekend vibe & lots of juice options. Heads up they do require everyone at the table to do bottomless.My only complaint is that you have to wait in line & it is pretty pricey.... But the line moves pretty fast, and what do you expect from one of the best brunch spots in SF. Still 5/5 for the food!,Great food and great service. This place was busy when we came, Tuesday morning, but we didn't have to wait to be seated. Our waitress was patient and answered all of our questions. Food was delicious, we loved everything we ordered. Food is reasonably priced for California ( I'm from Texas). I would highly recommend and would come here again.  You won't be disappointed. Big serving sizes and big flavor!,Came here with some friends during spring break. To be honest, we initially came to wait at Benkyodo but the line was infeasible, and so we found another well known gem nearby to eat our breakfast. We had the millionaires bacon sampler platter - and it lives up to its name! Really love the seasoning across the belabor - I especially love the rosemary one. I think it was perfect to share with three people. It was a bit small for anything over 4 people.For my main," I got the deep fried French toast - crisp on the outside and fluffy and most on the inside with added fruits and berries. The matcha latte is also quite pleasant in the morning - more on the bitter matcha side than the sweet side!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pinsa Rossa,"Wow, I don't write reviews often, but Pinsa Rossa was amazing. Great location, friendly staff, and cute vibe. I've definitely have had my share of pizzas, but I've never had a ""Pinsa."" The pinsa dough is really unique, a puffed, crispy, yet chewy dough, but I can't quite describe it. They also give you your own pizza cutter, which I thought was a fun touch!We tried multiple Pinsa, they were all good, and I don't know which one is my favorite. For more unique flavors the carbonara and portofino (fig and prosciutto) were amazing, but they have a pepperoni and sausage if you like a classic taste  Another note: we had leftovers and popped them in the toaster oven, wasn't expecting them to be as good the next day, but the crust was just as fluffy and crispy.Definitely will be back again to try more item, until then, thank you!,This was a cute restaurant with great ambiance on a very lively street in SF. They were quite busy when we arrived at 6:40pm ish. They have both indoor and outdoor seating with heater. However, the service tends to be a bit slow maybe because they're understaffed.CLASSIC CAPRESE: i was a little disappointed with this because I was expecting sweet cherry tomatoes but they were normal tart cherry tomatoes. The cheese was creamy and the seasoning was nice. But I think the whole dish would've been even better with sweet tomatoes. HEARTY TRUFFLE PIZZA: I really like their pizza dough! I'm not a huge fan of truffle flavor because it could be overpowering and too much after eating it for a while, but luckily I didn't feel like the truffle oil was too strong on the pizza. The pizza was nice and well balanced with the creamy white sauce and cheese, chewy and crispy dough, slightly salty meat, and truffle oil. PROSCIUTTO & STRACCIATELLA: I thought I would really like this pizza but turns out I'm not a huge fan of it. I feel like all the ingredients didn't harmoniously well in my mouth for some reason. I think I'm not a big fan or buratta on pizza because it's like melty and doesn't act like a glue with the other ingredients on the pizza.,What really made this place four stars for me was the quality of the pizza dough. It was delicious and so different from any other pizza dough I've had before. It was bouncy, bubbled up nicely on the crush, and had a great chew to it. If it weren't for the dough, I'd be giving this place 3-stars. We ordered the Eggplant and Bufalata Mozzarella pizza and there were literally 3 slices of mozzarella in total on the pizza. It wasn't enough for us to evenly split the cheesy parts of the pizza. The eggplant wasn't cooked through and still tough; it also lacked flavor.The second pizza we ordered was the Pesto Potato. I liked the idea of it more than eating it. There was a bit too much potato and too little mozzarella. The pesto also was lacking flavor; pretty much the only thing we tasted was the potato.I think this place has the potential to be a great pizza place; they just need to fine-tune their flavors better and also be more generous with their cheese.,This was a decent find on Fillmore. The portions are a bit small so I recommend ordering two flatbreads.No matter how small the portions are, the gnocchi is pretty good!! Solid 6/10 The pesto potato flatbread was just okay. Maybe a 5/10 for flavor but 10/10 for the bread itself. So fluffy and delicious!! I would try another in the future!!The interior is very warm and nice and the service is good.,RIP Dino's (then Dino & Santino's, then Santino's). I have lived in the neighborhood for over 25 years, My first apartment in the city was catty corner and I could always see into the windows and watch Dino schmooze with the locals.Times, they are a changing. I didn't really have faith in Dino's last iteration of a pizza and wine bar, and I think COVID really hurt the business (But I do think it was Dino's decision, not forced upon him to sell.) There are a few Dino's employees still working there (which is lovely).We ordered to split: -the broccolini (which was really really good, they should offer it on a pizza, it had lemon and warm cheese and some croutons, just  crave-worthy.)-  the mushoom pizza (the Forester I think it is called) and we added house-made sausage - which was an ideal add-on)- The crust was perfect Pinsa, crispy, airy and a bit of char.  We were ready to go and they brought us out a dessert (the dough fried with a pit of nutella) - We were already full, but powered through the four pieces.  use lovely of them to offer it up. Happy to support this new business.,There's a new pizza restaurant in Pac Heights.Actually not pizza. It's PINSA.  Two different things.Opening up where long time Dino's once was is Pinsa Roma, on the corner of California and Fillmore.  There's a pretty long list of 16 pinsas to choose from.  I enjoyed the Carbonara.  If you like Carbonara too, try this.  The guanciale (pork cheeks) was a nice flavorful topping.  I'd comeback to try other pinsas with guanciale, and there are quite a few.The pinsa crust here isn't quite as airy and puffy as other pinsas I've had locally.  But it was soft with a nice slightly crisp bottom. Just know that if you've had pinsa in Italy, there's no comparison. Not sure if the difference comes from the ingredients, oven or technique.  I like the upbeat vibes with music. I'm sure it'll be a popular neighborhood spot.  It was 100% packed.  No pastas. Focus is on the pinsas.,Yesterday evening I had a dinner here with a group of friends. I discovered this new restaurant one week ago just walking in my neighborhood. You can reserve a table through Resy. Pinsa is the main dish as the name suggests, and they offer several types of it. I chose the Margherita but with stracciatella instead of the normal mozzarella. I liked my Pinsa, it was perfectly cooked (crunchy around, but also soft at the same time). Also my friends enjoyed their Pinsa (my husband complaint was only the poor quantity of Prosciutto). The price is the same of the other pinseria (I think it's pretty high compared to a normal pizza). The restaurant is nice even though i didn't like the position of our table because it was close to the entrance. Overall, it's a good addition to the neighborhood.,I happened to pop in for their soft-opening last night;. A friend and I had a meatball appetizer that was yummy with a couple beers to start. Nice interesting variety of Pinsa options, many of which I've never seen. We shared one with an Italian ham, olives, artichokes, peas, and sliced eggs; I've never had eggs on my Pinsa/pizza before but it was a really good combination. The soy/rice crust was really light and airy, I ate half the Pinsa and did not feel bloated as with other crusts...was really light and tasty!We also had the Carpaccio plate also served with arugula and various healthy and tasty toppings. Lastly we had some red wine with our meal, my buddy are both wine drinkers and I looked at each other as we discovered another great wine! It was a UNTI Syrah blend which we're going to find and buy some bottles of.The staff were friendly and attentive, and Ken the owner was very friendly and there to please.Overall great food, nice atmosphere, and an attentive friendly staff. Score!,The portofino pizza is a bite of heaven! Also, the staff is incredibly welcoming and kind. We ordered the margarita, heavenly mushroom, portifino, and lasagna bolognese, and it came out very quickly! Everything was so delicious, and the ambience was immaculate. We love you, Pinsa Rossa.They also let us take birthday pictures in there for an annoying amount of time.,Great discovery for pizzas in sf. I really appreciated the service, the affordability and the pizzas. I tried a tomato base and a white base with mushrooms. Both were delicious but could have been a tad more flavorful in my opinion. Definitely recommend!,My first time here was a big hit. I got the lasagna which was delicious, but the highlight was my friend's gluten free pizza - the spicy Calibrian. She says it's the best gf crust she's ever had. I tried it and have to agree - better than many of the gluten full crusts I've had. We will be back.,We went to Pinsa Rossa for our date night and everything was so amazing! I think it was just a second night they've been open but it was pretty crowded for a Thursday night. All of their pinsa seems so good we almost couldn't choose so we chose 3 of them. They all were so delicious. My boyfriend loved the Prosciutto Cotto and my favorite was Pesto Potato. The ambiance was also very vibey with great music. The service was great. Everyone was very nice and friendly. This might become our new favorite date night spot.,We hadn't been to The Fillmore to see a concert since before the pandemic and a lot of our go to restaurants have closed....which is a good thing for us...as we would never have found Pinsa Rossa otherwise.  We were seated immediately with reservations.  The service was prompt and polite.  We had a nice bottle of Chianti that opened up well with a little twirl in the glass.  The dough was so friggen light and airy.  It looked like it would be a dense chewy crust.  We got the Prosciutto & Stracciatella that had just the right amount of toppings and a side of the Broccolini.  Both were excellent.  The 2 dishes plus bottle of wine were plenty for a pre-show meal that didn't leave me bloated on the dance floor.  Same time next weekend?,The experience from the moment we sat down to when we left was superb. Great service and ambiance provided a very enjoyable first time in this restaurant. Whenever you try a restaurant for a first time you never know how it will be -- this place isn't going anywhere. All of the dishes were fantastic. A few of my favorites were: carpaccio and all of the pinsas were amazing. If you like burrata, you gotta get the burrata and tomato salad. Highly recommend!,I went back again and it was a completely positive experience. I judged too soon on my first review. In fairness, it was their first day open after their remodel. Great team and nice ambiance.Best,,Pinsa Rossa is a must try for a chic yet causal spot to grab some authentic pinsa on Fillmore. Everything we had was awesome and I'd order it all again. The beef carpaccio was light and flavorful, the Caesar salad was classic (the croutons to die for), and the pinsas were 10/10. There are 16 pinsas to choose from but we opted for the carbonara, mushroom (& added sausage), and prosciutto and stracciatella. Don't forget the tiramisu and pinsa puffs (think beignet smothered with Nutella and pistachio cream). Run don't walk!,In our Fillmore neighborhood- perfect spot for a casual yet upscale-feeling resto. Everything was very fresh and cooked well.Pizzas are creative and include unusual combinations that work very well together. Little gem Caesar had the perfect amount of parmesan and creamy Caesar dressing. We had it with anchovies which added that nice balance of salty/creamy flavors.We tried two different Italian blends and loved both. It was a nice surprise to see an interesting wine menu (both local and Italian-based wines) - again giving it that upscale feeling.Highly recommend it and look forward to returning soon to enjoy a different pizza and wine pairing.,It's not Pizza, it's Pinsa! We went to Pinsa Rossa on Friday night to check out the new addition to Filmore Street.  It's great to see a new restaurant open post-pandemic.  The place was pretty busy (good sign) and the vibe was very much like a neighborhood ""go-to"" spot where you would likely run into someone you know.  Get in and check it out before it becomes a designation for people from other parts of the city.The pinsas are definitely the stars of the menu and there are so many great combinations.  What makes this truly unique is the crust.  You can research the detailed difference between pinsa and pizza dough, but I'll tell you that it's lighter, crispier, healthier, and delicious.  We tried two different pinsas and they both were fantastic.  We took the extra pieces home for lunch.     Their starters are perfect portions.  We had beet salad, meatballs (because you have to), and warm olives.  The wine list is a great match for the menu.  Also, don't leave without trying the desserts. The tiramisu is also unique, light, and a perfect finish to the experience.We'll be back and we already decided this will be a great alternative to your standard pizza places for takeout.,What a great addition to the neighborhood! If you haven't tried pinsa before, this is the place to go experience how flavorful it is. Its like pizza but way less filling. The ingredients are also super fresh. Nice atmosphere and you can even catch a big game on TV. Can't wait to return!,Great Pinsa and wine. Great atmosphere for the new spot in the neighborhood. Highly recommend!,Who knew ""Pinsas""was a thing... But it turns out quite a thing... Went in last week... They're just opening so things are still coming up to speed but the food was on point...Breasola salad was very very good and lightly dressed...The pinsas we had ( sausag/broccolini, carbonara) were nothing short of excellent... And the donuts for dessert taste exactly like begnets With a little delicious pistachio on top... Prices are reasonable for the quality of the food and drink... We will be back!,We were so excited to check out this new neighborhood spot and it did not disappoint! So so delicious and the service was great too! Our server Thomas was very friendly and attentive. As a group of 4 we ordered the gnocchi and caesar salad for appetizers and both were great! For our entrees we ordered 4 of the pinsas as a group because there were so many amazing flavors we couldn't decide!! All were delicious and we had lots of tasty leftovers to take home, but the absolute favorite was the Carbonara ... we will DEFINITELY be back! So excited to have this amazing addition to Fillmore Street,I had a delicious meal there with wonderful service.  Nice parklet and warm!  I recommend you try this restaurant. Thanks,So excited to have this place in the neighborhood. Food is amazing, place is so cute, and service is awesome. Highly recommend,Great place to eat with amazing service and incredible food!!!! Came twice in 1 week & both visits were great. Highly recommend!!,OMG this place is delicious!!!  Probably the best pinsa I have ever had. Ambiance is awesome and the staff super friendly. SO much better than the old pizza parlor that was in the space. My kids too absolutely loved the pinsa and desserts. My favorite was the pinsa with truffles.  This will be one of our GO TO's for sure 100%. A+ rating!  DELICIOUS.,Pinzas are crazy good. You have to try this place if you're looking for a healthy but delicious pizza,The perfect dining experience - from the food to the staff to the ambience. What they do with the pinsas  is simply art. Everything was so wonderful we just had to come back two nights in a row! So happy to have this gorgeous and delicious addition to the neighborhood; Huge thanks to chef Leo and Ken!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Italian Homemade Company,"Quick updateThese were good too:-Fettuccine w pesto-Oven baked tomato salad-Pappadelle with meatballs,A classic Italian spot with no frills. The sauce is flavorful but a bit on the salty side. I do love the variation of pasta options and sauces. It feels incredibly homey and fresh because you know the pasta is made to order.Price: $ Overall: 9.5/10Must get: pesto gnocchi, pappardelle,We were strolling along Union Street and suddenly the post-lunch dessert craving came.  BAM!  Okay, no problem, there should be LOTS of places along this street where we can get this taken care of--wrong.  What is this, some sort of dessert shop desert?  (Yes, I just used dessert and desert within 3 words of the same sentence, where is my award for THAT?).  Fortunately for us we came across this restaurant that was open at around 3pm on a weekday.Panna Cotta: 4.5/5.  I have to admit here that I am not a big panna cotta fan.  It's just custard for god sake!  Well, you top fresh panna cotta with delicious caramel sauce you have a real winner.  As in, winner, winner, chicken dinner!!  Craving conquered!Now I have to come back and try their entrees.,Nice cozy environment. The pasta taste like homemade. Tiramisu is good. For sure coming back again try different sauce. They recommend sauce is bolognese. delizioso!,Definitely real Italian pasta. And if you've been conditioned like most Americans, you may not appreciate the freshness. The salad was amazing I added prosciutto. The customer service was good with answering all my questions,Great italian food with no frills. Stopped by for dinner, no reservation. Order first before you grab a table. They have a variety of pasta and sauces you can pair up. The restaurant itself is homey and has an open kitchen concept where you can see the pasta being made -- it's really fresh. Ordered tagliatelle with meatballs and gnocchi with salsa parmigiano. Service was friendly and fast. Everything was delicious. Pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, and each bite had the right amount of sauce. However, the gnocchi was a tad bit on the dryer side. Do not sleep on the tiramisu! Need to try their pesto next.,Will add my review to the pile for this one - cute little spot with nice but lowkey seating - could be a casual date night, or a lovely dinner with a small group. We had four, we ordered first then sat. Menu is small and simple, fresh pasta, stuffed Flatbread, salads, wine, a couple desserts. My partner and I got pasta with bolognese (he got the ravioli, I got the pappardelle) plus a oven baked tomato salad to share. We all had some wines; my friends got the gnocchi, fettuccine with pesto, and one of the vegetarian cossone.Food was good - comforting, but I wouldn't say it blew my mind. That being said, it was well priced, so who cares? Still a good portion for a night out. I thought the bolognese was a bit one-note, but pasta definitely seemed fresh - chewy and rustic.I would go back when I need a heart warming but delicate portion for less than $16, an SF rarity!,The panna cotta was the one who stole the show for me! It was so creamy, the berry sauce was the right amount of sweetness. I would honestly say it is comparable to the panna cotta I had in Italy!The pasta was perfectly al dente, and every bite had enough sauce. I highly recommend this place, and understand why it is so popular.,Went to dinner last night in San Francisco after walking around the new neighboring Tunnel Tops Park. We ordered the same exact meal as during our previous visit, so that should tell you consistency is there. You also can't go wrong with a simple salad and fresh pasta with bolognese, which at The Italian Homemade is a basic staple and go-to on the menu. My favorite part about the restaurant is its' simplicity. Your order is taken at the counter before seating. Their menu is posted on the wall behind the pasta rolling station. There is a variety of pastas and sauces to mix and match. Everything from fettuccine, gnocchi, ravioli and their accompanied sauces are prepared to order. Then you pick your own seating and bring your number to the table. There's a sense of comfort with the low thrill of the place, and charm with the niche Italian imports they sell.,It was a cool, foggy Sunday night around 8PM. My beautiful, sassy girlfriend and I were trying to grab a late dinner after a movie. Not much is open that late on a Sunday, but we walked 30 minutes to get here.Love the casual atmosphere, the pasta itself was wonderful-- perfectly Al dente but I wish the sauce had a bit more character and depth (red sauce). The pricing was fair, the service was wonderful but if you are expecting the best pasta of your life you may be disappointed.  Still a solid choice, I would certainly come back but wanted to keep it honest.This reminds me of a much, much better ""Presto Pasta"" --- and I love PP.,Loooove Italian Homemade just as the name suggests taste like homemade Italian. Fresh chewy pasta and there bolognese is PERFECT. I get tubs of it to go so I never have to make it because I can't complete!,Delicious. We got the meat lasagna, meat ravioli with meatballs/bolognese sauce, fettuccine pasta with white sauce, and pappardelle pasta with butter and sage. They were making pasta behind the counter so you know their food is fresh. Self serve water station. Highly recommended.,The best pasta in the city. Period. My favorites that I personally recommend: 1. Pappardelle with butter and sage sauce 2. Gnocchi with marinara sauceSmall place though, and therefore it's hard to find seating during the dinner rush hour. ""Basic menu"" that's full of yumminess.,A tried and true establishment! This restaurant is lauded throughout all my different social circles and now I can understand why. The restaurant is simple, you order a type of noodle, a type of sauce, and then bam! There you go...a customized entrée.The pasta and sauces here are incredibly delicious and they even have pappardelle noodles which are quite rare to find.,I didn't personally love the pesto sauce - I wish I had gotten a cheesy sauce instead. The sauce was pretty textured, if that makes sense, and had a unique taste. The Parmesan that came with it was not nearly enough. I wouldn't personally recommend the pesto, but I would go back to try gnocchi with a cheesy sauce.,Italian homemade is well known for a reason. It's pretty reasonably priced for fresh pasta in the city and you can never go wrong with any of their sauces. It's so comforting and 100% gives you the cozy feeling of eating a homemade meal. It's such a great place to go with friends or pick up for dinner. Definitely a go to!,I'm finally writing a review for this place, been coming here for a while now for my pasta fix. An excellent place for a quick lunch or dinner if you're craving pasta. My personal favorite is the gnocchi with butter and sage sauce; it fills me up and can't go wrong with it. I've also tried the fettuccine with bolognese sauce, lasagna, papperdele, YUM.Definitely try this place if you're around the area.,Burrata Salad Tiramisu Meat RavioliQuaint little shop. Counter service. Limited beer and alcohol selection. The bolognese sauce was pretty good. The squid ink pasta was too salty though. Tiaramisu not bad.Limited seating though. There are some outside tables but really limited.,The food was delicious but its not too authentic. Ordered the caccio e pepe, sauce was a bit too runny but the taste was good. Tiramisu was not the best, too much whipped cream and a bit too sweet. Staff is super friendly and service is super quick!,My meatball looked like someone took a bite out of it. A good 1/3 is missing. Whoever served and boxed my order failed. Or needs their eyes examined.,I'd argue this place is slightly overrated considering how high it is rated compared to other restaurants in the area (and still decently pricey considering it being somewhat fast casual). To begin, if you come later in the evening, it seems like a good amount of stuff is sold out. The most popular dishes were all unavailable.We ordered the tagliatelle with meatballs and the seasonal Cacio Pepe. The cacio Pepe was much too cheesy and heavy for my personal taste, definitely lacking in pepper as well. The tagliatelle was quite good, although nothing too special. Wouldn't strongly consider coming back again unless it happened to be most convenient.,This is a great no frills basic pasta restaurant when you're craving pasta, but don't want to dress up , don't feel like cooking , and don't want to spend a lot. They have a few basic sauce selections to choose from and you get to also choose what style of pasta you want your sauce on.  Nice cozy inside with some tables outside if you're a party of two. I hope that they broaden their sauce selections in the future, but for now , I'm content enough to be a repeat customer.,This is a solid Italian place. I wouldn't say the food is AMAZING, but it seems like a solid consistent place if you want pretty good Italian food. We definitely over ordered for the two of us and ended up taking home leftovers. I enjoyed the burrata salad and the ravioli the most. The meatballs were a little too salty for my taste. The portions here are pretty hefty, which makes it a better deal.,I love love LOVE the Italian Homemade Company! I have been to both the Hayes Valley and original North Beach locations and I felt the quality of food stayed consistent across the board. I happened to come here recently around the Thanksgiving weekend as my partner and I felt there would be better luck with street parking around this location and we were right! We easily parked a street over Union and walked down here.As always I opt for the pappardelle noodles with bolognese sauce and my partner got veggie ravioli. There was plenty of indoor and outdoor seating available here (they also have a parklet further down from the establishment), so we decided to sit outside right in front of the restaurant. Portion sizes here are good for the price as I left feeling super full, so we went for a walk around the marina green afterwards. Definitely a cute and casual date spot for either lunch or dinner and walkable to many other attractions in the Marina!,(3.5 Stars) I've heard really great things about the Italian Homemade Company so I was excited to finally try it! We went to the Marina location for an early dinner. I love customizing my food, so being able to mix-and-match the different pastas and sauces was definitely a highlight. We ordered the Pappardelle with Bolognese, Veggie Ravioli with Pesto, and the Burrata Salad. The Pappardelle was cooked really well and tasted fresh and homemade. The Veggie Ravioli was nothing special IMO- the Pesto sauce was good though! Everything was mostly solid- no dish was mind-blowingly amazing, but it's a great option for fast, casual Italian dining. I'd be open to coming back to try other combinations!,I've been wanting to check out this place ever since I heard about it from a friend rave about the lasagna (I still have to try it). I ended up ordering the pappardelle with bolognese sauce, and oh my god it was delicious. You really can't beat fresh pasta paired with a savory sauce. It wasn't salty like what previous reviews mentioned but I guess it varies for people. Either way you have to check this place out!,Good but three stars for price.  $25 for a plate of pesto tortellini where you order at the counter.  They've raised their prices too much IMO.,a must for some italian food! they allow you to customize your pasta- just choose the type of pasta and then the sauce. i always get the tagliatelle with pesto, and it is by far my favorite combination. My boyfriend loves the ravioli and lasagna here too! I don't think you can go wrong with any combination, but the pesto is definitely out of this world.,Tortellini was very strong so it balanced well with the mild tasting white sauce. Dont forget the pepper.,Consistently solid home made pasta place with three locations in SF. We tend to go to the one in Hayes Valley and tonight we needed something quick and casual before heading to ACT for an evening theatre performance. My wife and I each got the pappardelle with meat bolognese sauce with two meatballs and it was cooked perfectly and the meatballs were tasty and not dense with a fresh tasting sauce. For a little over $30 for the two of us before tax and tip it was an excellent and filling dinner before our show tonight. Still up to par! Glad they are here and stilling doing it well !,The Italian Homemade Company is a good spot if you are craving fresh pasta but don't feel like going out to a fancy restaurant. It is basically the Chipotle of Italian food - you get to customize your pasta shape, sauce, and add-ins as you see fit. I went for the pesto pappardelle, and thought it was pretty good! The noodles tasted fresh and the sauce had a great texture. I was hoping for a slightly bigger portion (I visited with two friends and their portions were both about double what I got) but otherwise I was happy with the meal and would definitely order it again.One last note I wanted to mention - the speed! This was the fastest turn-around on take-out that I've had so far in San Francisco. My two friends and I ordered online at 8:19pm and received an estimate that our orders would be done at 8:35pm. But then we all received emails at 8:27pm saying the orders were finished. That means it only took 8 minutes from order to order completion. In other words, you are only 8 minutes away from picking up delicious pasta on a whim - dangerous!,Got lightheaded immediately after eating there, then had food sickness, and my brother did too. I never have stomach problems like I had after eating there. Unclean kitchen conditions.,What a delight! Amazing vegetarian Italian food. The veggie lasagna was filled with flavor and made with fresh veggies. The veggie ravioli is filled with spinach and Ricotta cheese. You can hardly tell its spinach apart from the green color it adds to the ricotta. We took it with Pesto Sauce. The Pesto was very tasteful, a bit on the oily side. Absolutely not to miss is the Panna cotta! We tried it with strawberry. The panna cotta melts in your mouth. Will definitely revisit, can't wait to try the other offerings. Great staff and service. Very attentive and helpful while ordering too. Also, its fun to watch them making the pasta next to the billing counterWe visited Friday evening, were able to find a place quickly after ordering.,Fresh pasta and homemade sauces for a great price? What more can I say?! This spot has all different types of fresh pasta and sauces. I usually order the Pappardelle with pasticciata, which is a bolognese sauce with bechamel creme! The sauce is flavorful with a lot of meat and was not too creamy. The fresh pasta was al dente and was paired well with the sauce. Highly recommend!,Hands down the best pasta I've had in a while! This is my second time coming here and it hasn't changed a bit. The food is so yummy and I was left wanting more. I ordered the meat raviolis with bolognese while my family ordered the veggie raviolis with meatballs and both types of lasagna (meat & veggie). Tasting my dish (meat raviolis), I thought the sauce was so rich and flavorful! The sauce tasted very unique. The raviolis were cooked al dente and filled with a lot of filling. The filling was so smooth that it melted in your mouth. The veggie raviolis were very good too. They were filled with ricotta and spinach.  The veggie lasagna was huge and tasted like it sounds. The meat lasagna I didn't try but I assume it tasted just as good as any other dish we tried.,Time & Date: Saturday, 8/22/21 @ 1:45pmCrowd: not busy, many open tablesDining: indoor + a few outdoor tablesVaccine proof: scans QR code if dining indoorsI've tried the location in Berkeley and remember it being pretty good, and was in the mood for some carbs (not a surprise) so I stopped by Italian Homemade. I love thick noodles, so I ordered the Pappardelle with Pasticciata sauce & it was tangy, slightly creamy, with some meat. My favorite part about the dish was how wide each strand of pasta was, it reminded me of hand pulled noodles! The Tagliatelle with Pesto sauce has a super strong basil herb flavor, but it lacked saltiness & flavor other than that. The Fettuccini with White sauce was a total disappointment, it tastes as bland as it looked. I had to ask for salt & pepper for that dish for it to taste okay. TOverall, I only enjoyed the Pappardelle with Pasticciata sauce!,Amazing service, lots of options. Not from the area but was craving housemate pasta. Absolutely tasty. I'm super happy we made the trip over to have some authentic homemade Italian pasta. Staff is very nice and accommodating. Italian chinotto soda was delicious. Buratta salad was so good and just the perfect amount of saltiness and sweet from the balsamic glaze. Pasta was fresh and soft.,I'm usually very picky about pasta and Italian food in general, but this place surpassed my expectations! The pasta here is savory, delicious, and checked all the boxes of salt, fat, acid, and heat.We came during off-hours so no wait. Cute seating and homey ambiance. Must order is their meatball! So moist and flavorful. I'm not a fan of white sauce, but their tortellini with white sauce was the perfect balance of sharp and soft.Great casual place to come to when you're craving Grade A pasta.,I loved the chicken parmeasean very good and great service not bad for a Italian restraunt in Marina but the floors and bathrooms were really dirty will come back in future,It wasn't bad fresh pasta and choice of your own sauce, very nice and quiet place to eat at on a Tuesday afternoon. So-so service and easy menu, would go again but not a favoriteFlatbread was really just a tortilla, was picturing focaccia bread.,I was looking for some Italian food around the Nob Hill area that wouldn't break my wallet, and the Italian Homemade Company was wonderful!I came here on a late Wednesday night. There were several people dining, but there was no wait. You order at the counter then seat yourself at the tables. The water is self serve.I ordered the tagliatelle with Pasticciata sauce. I loved it because it was very al dente (I like firm pasta), and the sauce mixed extremely well with this pasta shape! The portion size was perfect because I had just finished a workout. My friends got the veggie ravioli with Pesto and fettuccine with White Sauce. They enjoyed theirs as well.The interior is also very well decorated. Overall 10/10 dining experience.,My friends picked up dinner for us here and again, it was fantastic. One new thing we tried (besides the Pappardelle, Fettuccine, and Ravioli) was the Pesto Gnocchi, and it was beyond delicious, amazingly soft, full of flavor. 5 stars, and I'm bumping this restaurant a well-deserved 5 stars! Takeout for 4 adults & 2 babies (6 entrees) came out to $104.,Really enjoyed the Pappardelle with Sauce & Meatballs as well as the Beef and Ricotta Cheese filled Meat Ravioli. Just the warm hearty filling meal I needed from the cold foggy weather for fleet week while I was in visiting the city.,I really like the place. Ordered 3 dishes:Tagliatelle Bolognese, vegetarian ravioli with pesto, and arugula salad with mozzarella.The pasta is delicious. The Bolognese sauce was good. Not a fan of pesto as it has some other distinct aroma that I don't personally like. The price is a bit steep At $45 I think, but overall really good.Need to specially mention the service. The cashier lady was super lovely and helpful. She definitely gets 6 stars.,I love coming here for the fresh, made-to-order pasta (al-dente!) and have tried many (but not nearly all) of the possible combinations of pastas and sauces. It's always so mesmerizing to watch them make the pasta on the counter behind the glass partition. My favorite is the pappardelle with either the pesto or butter & sage sauces! The gnocchi roll is also very unique here and is absolutely delicious.This place is definitely in my rotation of 'must return' and worth the wait.,Came here for dinner and the pasta did not disappoint- everything was fresh and delicious. My friend and I got the gnocchi and pappardelle and both of them were so delicious and fresh. They have indoor and outdoor seating which is nice since the inside can get really crowded. It's pretty cool that you ca customize your pasta and pick and choose what noodle and sauce that you get. Because it's in the north beach area I would say that you should either lyft/Uber or carpool so that you don't have a hard time finding parking - I'm not sure if they have a parking lot but I did see street parking in the area. The food itself is delicious and the staff is efficient and works quickly. The amount of pasta is pretty good, the perfect amount for one meal- although I'm sure if you're not hungry you could have the leftovers as an additional meal. Would definitely come here and order to go or just have another meal here if I'm in the area!,Wow everything about this place was perfect. I got the Pappardelle Pasta with bolognese sauce and parmesan grated on top. Heaven on a plate is an understatement!The noodles were a beautiful yellow color, had a great chew to them, and held the sauce well. And that sauce was so rich and umami with the perfect amount to coat the ribbons of pasta.The pasta was a decent portion and I liked how you can basically build your own. You choose which noodle you want and then the sauce. There are some that are already made like lasagna but everything is fresh. It's cool to be able to see them freshly making raviolis behind the glass!The staff was awesome and since it was fresh, it came out so quickly! And should I mention the decor was a chic eclectic! Very aesthetic! You bet I'll be coming back to try all of the other combos ;),Love love love this gem in the Marina! Completely unpretentious, delicious, affordable, quaint, fresh-ass pasta. I enjoy watching them roll out the pastas right by the window as I decide what to order. Always check their specials! They had a great squid ink fettuccini with baby octopus recently that was bomb, and their tortellini are so flavorful!,Okay YUM!!! I was thinking this would be a little fancier but it was a more relaxed feel. It's counter service and then they bring your your meal. After we ordered, I went to go fill up my water and two of the staff were speaking Italian with some girls sitting at the bar so I immediately knew the food was going to be authentic. And it truly was!! I got the butter sage while my husband got the bolognese. The noodles tasted so fresh and were perfectly cooked. We decided right there that we would come back at least monthly to try other sauces and types of pasta. Great food, great service, great vibes.,VERY YUMMY !! Nice & not super loud inside so u can talk to ur bae  def coming again !!!!!,There truly isn't a better bang for your buck Italian restaurant in the Bay Area. The food is absolutely delicious and so generously portioned for the price that I can't imagine anyone else doing it better than the Italian Homemade Company! It's all in the name and fully tastes like my grandma was in that kitchen making my lasagne!,I went to this place at the urging of my friend. He said it was freshly made pasta, you choose your sauce and it's quick. That's a recipe that I like and I was excited to try it.He was right on all points and I was pleased that the food was good, fairly priced and the serving portions were respectable.It's a fast food kinda place without being a fast-food joint. I've only been there once, but with all the items on the menu, the combinations you can play with, and with offerings beyond just pasta, multiple visits will produce different results and I can only predict they'll be good.Keep the quality up folks and here's to many returns.,Great tasting Italian food. I enjoyed the Lasagna and it was a very hearty portion. Others in my group enjoyed the pastas but their portions were clearly smaller.  The decor is simple [rustic], it's a no-frills place where you order at the counter and chose your own seat - but the food is tasty and reasonably priced [not cheap].,Simple and delicious, the Italian Homemade company knows what they're doing. I ordered the pappardelle with parmigiana sauce and a tiramisu for dessert. The pasta was perfectly fresh and the sauce wasn't overbearing. Just the right amount! I'm such a fan of thicker pastas and this really hit the spot. The tiramisu was also really good and simple. A ton of whipped cream and a small layer of coffee soaked ladyfingers but a portioned out perfectly.,Where else in San Francisco can you get excellent-quality, fresh, homemade pasta with a delicious bolognese sauce for $12.25?!  And in Cow Hollow, no less!!  Prefer a creamy bechamel sauce?  No problem!  Tortellini made with prosciutto, mortadella, and parmigiano with a brown butter sage sauce?  They've got you covered!  Start with a housemade meatball cassone, their version of an Italian handpie ($11), which could also be your whole meal...or add some pasta or lasagna, which has so many thin layers of perfectly-crafted hand-rolled sheets of fresh pasta, meat or veg, and bechamel, it could make your Italian Nonna cry tears of pure joy!  Finish dinner off with a delicious piece of tiramisu or caramel-topped panna cotta, and then lie back and enjoy the deep, carb-induced slumber of one who has eaten well!!Great.  Now I've made myself hungry again...This location offers GLUTEN-FREE PASTA and sauces, is WHEELCHAIR-ACCESSIBLE, and is located just a block away from what is arguably The Best Gelato in all of San Francisco....you know what you have to do!!!,The meat lasagna was really salty. Good portion size for this dish - hearty! But... a bit too salty for me.,So good!  We had gnocchi with pesto and ravioli with marinara. The portions were good. The service was quick and excellent!,It was just okay.. I get that it's ""authentic Italian"" but does that mean it needs to taste so bland? My party and I found ourselves adding more parm, chili flakes, and pepper to our pasta, but all that didn't make it any better. The flavor is sorta there but it's begging to be brought out with some salt or something,Very yummy pasta! Big serving sizes and we're definitely taking some home. The bolognese sauce is surprisingly light but incredibly filling. The noodles were fresh and so good! Boyfriend got the lasagna and he loved it,We came here for an early dinner around 5pm. It was quite crowded especially since it's near Fleet Week festivities, although we didn't purposely come here to watch that. My friend ordered the veggie ravioli and I ordered gnocchi with pesto sauce. We also shared the tiramisu cake for my early birthday celebration. Portion was on the smaller size except the cake. Everything was very yummy though and reasonable price for SF under $15 per pasta dish. Nice outdoor seating with around 8 tables, and a few indoor tables too.,The portions were sizable and tasted great, though the sauce was definitely greasy. It was so nice to be able to mix and match noodles and sauce style. The casual setting was enjoyable. A great, easy spot to grab a meal.,Luca is so wonderful and helpful. I had a problem with door dash app and he went out of his way to make sure my food was ready and delicious. Thank you so much Luca for everything you did to make my meal so delicious. Your customer service is amazing.,Lasagna was not what I expected... They have no spaghetti noodle improvised with fettuccine noodle.,This place serves Excellent Pasta! I ordered Butter & Basil Pasta, and it was Great! Cooked well, made Fresh, smelled & tasted Very Good! The portion was a tad bit sparse- but nonetheless, very Good & Flavorful!,Very good pasta in San Francisco!! Easy and cheap and all homemade!! Great customer service and best pasta to quickly grab in San Francisco!!,Delicious homemade Italian pasta. I had the gnocchi with pesto. It was divine. My partner had the meat lasagna. He said it taste good. I do wish they had garlic bread. They did have a flatbread but it don't just hit the spot. I like that you could buy pasta to take home and make yourself. I wish they had an Alfredo sauce but they have some kind of Parmesan cream sauce that's probably the same. I don't really know. Very good!,A personal fave. Probably the most ordered place on my delivery service app. I was a student on a budget and just wanted good food. It was the go-to place. The choice of food was good. The staff is friendly. Casual atmosphere. I order at the counter and find a spot to sit and wait for some delicious homemade pasta. Real Italians come here. The lasagne was tasty, so fresh, and so filling. I've been to both locations in SF, and although different, the delicious pasta and sauces are of the same high quality. You will not be disappointed! I can't wait to go back.,Came here when COVID restrictions allowed 20% capacity to dine in. Watching the pasta being made was mouthwatering to say the least! Temperature were taken before entering and it all felt very safe. We ordered:Papardelle w/ pasticciata which is a bechamel sauce mixed with bolognese. Highly recommend this! It was our favorite by far.Gnocchi with pesto - this was ok. We aren't really fans of gnocchi and the pesto was a little too green for us. It was still pretty good! I ordered this because I saw a few Yelpers order it. Classico piadina - basically like a quesadilla stuffed with cheese, prosciutto, & arugula. We got this because our godson wanted bread and not pasta! I feel like the pasta is more worth it however.Overall the food was delicious and fresh. Everything was delicious, place was clean, and the service was fine! I regret not getting the ravioli and trying out their bolognese. I'd come back if I was in the area!,Went there after seeing the reviews on Yelp.Absolutely fantastic pasta at a place that is not pretentious. You order your food and find a table. It's not trying to transport you to Venice or Rome or Milan. They concentrate on your food and it is fresh, wonderfully seasoned and delicious.,Always get takeout from Italian homemade and it never disappoints!My go to food when I'm craving carbs. The butter and Sage sauce is rich and flavorful with fresh sage on top. Can't go wrong with any of their pastas. Their lasagne is heavenly but very heavy so you can get multiple meals out of it.,This place offered good quality food. The only problem was that I couldn't customize my pasta. I wanted to do sausage and basil fettuccini without onions and they couldn't do it. If you don't mind sticking to their set menu, this place is really good.,Ordered for delivery the other day because they had great review so my gf and I decided to try it out. I ordered the butter & garlic gnocchi, pesto pappardelle pasta, & tiramisu. Was really excited to try it out, but when our ordered came the bag was missing our tiramisu?! And on top of the the pappardelle was bland and lacked flavored. But the the gnocchi was amazing, hence the only reason I'm putting 3 star instead of 1. I got my tiramisu refund from the app but overall was underwhelmed with the experience.,I didn't like the service, I made my order and they forgot the meatballs and when questioning they didn't give any answer, I don't recommend this place!,Love to pick food up at this location and go eat it at the marina green. Can't get enough of the pappardelle with bolognese and the gnocchi with bolognese. I'll try the raviolis one day... I bring friends here when I need my pasta fix.,OMG delicious! and fresh!!We got a meat lasagna (big enough for 2 kids to share), fettuccine with meatballs, and tortellini with butter & sage sauce. Amazing meal -- everyone must experience this.,This is my go to spot when I come to the city-- sometimes drive to SF just for this spoPasta never disappoints & the staff is super friendly! :),Good food, quick service, nice staff, quality experience. I came here for a friend's birthday dinner and Italian Homemade didn't let us down! A couple of us decided to be bold and go for the pasta special. You can imagine our surprise when a black (squid ink) pasta dish was brought out. I've never had anything like this before, but I was pleasantly surprised. Wouldn't say squid ink is my favorite now, but it wasn't bad overall. I could tell it was well-made. Word of advice: ask what the special is *before* you order it!All my friends were happy overall. I thought the pricing was fair. Would recommend.,If you like homemade and of legit Italian heritage, head on over to The Italian Homemade Company!

 this place a lot. And from her Instagram posts, all the dishes look phenomenal.With socially distanced outdoor dining being back in SF, we helped ourselves to a tiny table. There's a decent amount of tables like maybe 5 for that sits 2. The only table that accommodates 3 people is the one by the window sign. I think this is the best spot since you can see them making the noodles right there. Either way you can enjoy your meal on a good sunny day or simply people watching walking Cow Hollow.For our meal, we ordered Pesto Gnocchi, Meat Ravioli (which my dad liked), Fettuccine with meatball sauce, Classica Piadina & Burrata Salad. I would say my favorite was the salad - it was divine. I would have liked the gnocchi if I had strips of chicken in there but otherwise it was still OK :) Tiramisu did wonders too for my belly. Always a great idea to have dessert.You don't have to worry about parking since they have  metered street parking in the area (payable with coins or CC). You can also use the bathroom inside the establishment. Just be mindful to follow the 1 customer at a time within the store!,I do NOT understand the hype about this place. I do really like the concept and think its awesome that they make homemade pasta, as that is something I have become really into. The execution is just not done well at ALL. I have eaten here twice and both times felt the exact same way - the pasta is WAY over cooked and the sauces lack flavor majorly. The first time I got it we got delivery, we got the gnocchi with the Parmesan sauce and pappardelle with the pasticciata sauce. I (which I have never done ever before) took one bite of the gnocchi literally had to add tons of salt and Parmesan to the sauce because it literally tasted like water. The pappardelle I had to add salt and chili flakes and garlic powder because it also lacked flavor and the pasta broke when I picked it up with my fork. We thought that maybe it was just because we ordered delivery, as Italian food just isn't the same delivered. I thought I'd give it another chance, so I went to the Berkeley location last night and had the exact same experience. I don't think they salt their pasta water either because the pasta itself has no flavor. Its so sad because they make the pasta from scratch but completely butcher it when they cook it. Such a bummer.,All the restaurants on Union streets are fantastic but this place holds its own uniqueness! What makes it stand out is the handmade pasta. Menu is simple, quick and easy to order. I opted for the pasta pescatore special, it was straight forward, delicious doesn't have to be complicated. My hubby really enjoyed his lasagna. It was cheese and sauced to the max, super yummy. We shared a piece of tiramisu for a sweet ending and it was satisfying.They take Covid safety very seriously. Only one customer at a time inside for ordering. Sidewalk tables were properly spaced.,If you love authentic, fresh Italian pasta you have to try Italian Homemade!  I ordered the Tortellini pasta with Pasticciata sauce, as recommended by the server.  It was sooo good, the Tortellini were pretty meaty and filling, it tasted very fresh and I loved the mix of red and cream sauce on top.  The portions were just enough to fill me up but not really enough for leftovers, if you're a leftovers lover.  My friends ordered the Tagliatelle Bolognese, and the meat ravioli with Salsa Parmigiano which they loved as well, although my friend felt that the ravioli was a little lighter on the portion size.  But I'll definitely be back to get my pasta fix!,See carbs, smell carbs, eat carbs! The menu features mainly Italian flatbread sandwiches and homemade pasta. The build-your-own pasta setup allows you to select the pasta of your choice and the accompanying homemade sauce. This is a much more modern and sleek venue than I would expect of a mom and pop Italian spot cranking out homemade pasta, but the original location will give you more of that home-y feel.We came here for a late lunch and ate more than we intended to. First off, the portions are very generous. While we waited for our food, we watched the guys behind the counter roll out sheets of beautiful pasta dough.The Italian Homemade Company has overcome that resistance. It's worth the trip! Thanks Guys!,We ordered our pasta to-go and got their pesto gnocchi and butter and sage fettuccine. We had high expectations for this place after reading great reviews on Yelp. First impression was the small portion size and we were sorely disappointed. Our pastas filled maybe only 1/4 of the entirety of the to-go box. I wish I had saved a picture to show how little pasta was in that box.  The pasta itself was just okay and nothing spectacular. PROS: fresh pasta with affordable pricesCONS: small portion sizes,Quality has gone off a cliff at Italian Homemade and I'm so disappointed as this was one of my favorite pasta places to go to in the city. I stopped by last night and ordered pappardelle with pesto and the noodles were rolled too thin, and extremely overcooked. The pesto itself was bland and the entire dish desperately needed some salt. I brought friends along yesterday evening who had never tried out the place and I was very embarrassed the food was so disappointing. Reading recent reviews, it seems like I'm not the only person mentioning overcooked noodles. For a dish with just two ingredients, those two ingredients must be executed perfectly and last night's dish was any but that.,I don't think this place needs anymore positive reviews .. but here goes! Loveee the vibe, the food, the wine! You can't go wrong here. We got the veggie lasagna, and the ravioli with olive oil for dinner and didn't leave a bite! For dessert we got the tiramisu - and it's the fluffiest tiramisu I have had! It comes close to my favorite one in New York City. It's a must visit and I know I am going to be going here often!,**Open for takeout during shelter in place.**Ordered takeout from this place for an outdoor picnic at Crissy Field.Outside of the restaurant, you'll see a few tables for outdoor dining.  When you first walk into the restaurant, you'll see an artist to your right making fresh pasta. I had the privilege of watching raviolis being made from scratch, which is not an easy process. I could have watched for so much longer if my food hadn't been ready. I ordered the lasagna (pictured), which was very filling and very delicious. The lasagna was saucy, cheesy, full of layers and layers, and quite addicting. I definitely should have saved some for leftovers instead of stuffing myself with this, but it was so good! I will definitely try this place again. I hope I'll have the courage to try something else since there are so many option. But that might be hard since I already know I want to eat the lasagna again!,Cute and delicious homemade portions in a quaint marina setting. The gnocchis w butter and sage were very fluffy- while the lasagna was quite a treat as well. The meatballs -however- were exquisite, so I wish there were more of them! How do you guys get that texture is the real question ?! Try the tiramisu, although it won't be the typical shape you're used to. But worth the sugar!,What's a better feeling than touching down in SFO after a 5 hour flight? Watching your food touch down at your curbside table outside this spot. Bonus if you surprise your lady to a dinner here after the flight :),I had heard rave reviews from some family members and so we decided to trek from the South Bay to SF to try out the pasta here. Outdoor dining was very limited due to COVID so we decided to order to go. We ended up ordering over 10 different combinations of pasta. The woman who took my order over the phone was incredibly patient and attentive as I blabbered out my huge order. I can't exactly remember what we all got but I know we had the gnocchi with sage butter, a couple pastas with the pesto, a couple other types of pasta with the bolognese with cream, and a strawberry panna cotta. We drove twenty minutes back home and alas, the noodles were all stuck together. It took some microwaving and adjusting to get the consistency right again. I loved the bolognese sauce and wish that I had gotten pasta with it instead of ravioli, but the ravioli was still tasty. I didn't like the pesto at all, far too oily and it upset my tummy a bit.I'm guessing everything would've tasted nicer if we didn't have it as late as we did. Would love to try this restaurant another time!,I would knock them down to between 3 and 4 stars, with this time being 9 months after I previously ate their food. We always order the same dishes. My meatballs were overcooked and slightly burnt on one side and instead of being light, were rubbery and tasted like they added too many bread crumbs. I also didn't taste the nutmeg, as I used to. I don't know if the cooking was off, or if they've changed the recipe. The rest of the food was fine, though the white sauce was very bland. I believe it was around $20 for my dish with the added meatballs, and now feel I can do better for the money.  I will probably skip this place in the future.,This restaurant is a hidden gem tucked away in San Francisco.  The pasta was fresh, service was great and everything was clean.  Do no pass it up if you are looking for some great pasta dishes.  We had tortellini and also the meat ravioli- which was FULL of meat!  So pleasantly surprised by the amount of meat in the ravioli and yet none of them fell apart in my bowl.,THE best pasta I've ever had! Simple but amazingly delicious. We ordered 2 different plates and We couldn't decide which one was our favorite! Home made pasta wow! A must when in San Francisco! Definitely coming back!!,Delicious, delicious pasta - I could probably eat this all day. Easy pick up after ordering and very neat packaging makes it perfect for a picnic somewhere. I had the pappardelle and it was so full of flavor. Tasted good even when it was a bit of cold - so I can imagine it's all the better when it's piping hot. I wasn't a fan of the tiramisu as it was a bit of too runny; so personally could have skipped. Overall, this was a great dining experience.,I could have cooked up some pasta myself and put nothing but salt on it and it would have tasted better than the Fettuccine + White sauce. Really surprised that this has 4.5 stars with all these reviews.The lasagna also wasnt that much better than school lasagna lol,Pros:1. Food!! There is nothing on their menu I don't like.  Everything is fresh and tasty.  Not fancy just delicious.  Also fun to watch as they make the fresh pasta2. Clean place3. Friendly staffCons:1. Parking on Union St is always a challenge but if you're a local, it's an easy walk,Love this place. Stopped by as I was near a coffee shop on the way to see the sea lions. Came in at 1130 Ish on a weekday and one of the employees was making pasta. The pappardelle bolognese came out quick and was absolutely delicious. I had meatballs added and the flavor and textures were amazing. Definitely would come again. My gf ordered the veggie ravioli and it was ok. I would not get that again it was a little cold. Maybe it was just that one time, at least they have vegetarian options with the veggie lasagna.,A good place for Italian food. The food is very good. I ordered a classic pasta with meatballs and marinara sauce, and a side of extra meatballs. The pasta was so thick and flavorful, the meatballs just burst in my mouth like an explosion of flavor, and on top of all of that, the atmosphere was perfect, the decorations were suddenly beautiful, and the service was incredible. For fast casual dining, the food and service was excellent. I definitely appreciate the fresh, homemade quality, which is quite a good deal at these prices.,Awesome homemade fresh pasta that is affordable. The fettuccine pasta is super long and cooked to perfection. Bolognese sauce had a nice balance.,Very good & affordable pasta. I have ordered takeout from here dozens of times, and it never disappoints. The pasta is so fresh. My go to order is the fettuccine with white sauce. I have also gotten the lasagna many times, which is awesome (but could probably feed 2 people EASILY, it's a huge portion). This place is wonderful for takeout or dine-in, and it won't break the bank.,Ordered the cassone with broccoli rabe and two cheeses. The filling was  bland and stodgy, virtually unseasoned," and the dough encasing it was raw at the edges.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Horsefeather,"Came here on a Monday evening with a couple friends, and frankly was not expecting it to be as packed as it was! We didn't have a reservation, so ended up sitting at the bar for ~45 minutes before being seated at a table. Seemed to be a really good place for dates/small groups. Ordered a few food items to share including mushroom risotto, duck fat fries, and charred broccolini - all delicious, always appreciate a bar that has good food options as well :)Definitely has a bit of an upscale vibe, with a pricier, unique drink menu. Between my friends and I, we sampled a few including the California Cooler, Jack of Roses, and Orchard Toddy - all were good, and there are definitely more we want to come back to try!,We came after having dinner on Divisadero on a rainy Saturday night. Despite the rain, this place was packed. The bar attracts all types of people, which is cool. Everyone just minds their own business, which is what I like. The bar itself has a cute vibe and the music playlist was good all night. The drinks were good and the service was alright. It seems to be a fun date night spot or a place to hang out with your girlfriends. I'd probably come back if I was in the Nopa area and wanted to hit up a bar.,[TLDR: Good food options, delicious drinks, smaller venue = less seats, friendly and patient staff--especially with big groups!]I am obsessed with the cozy yet upscale atmosphere at Horsefeather!  My first visit was for a friend's birthday, so I knew it was trustworthy from the start.  The venue was a bit smaller than I expected, so seating was a bit tight, but the staff fit our group of 10-12 in a back booth with ease.  The menu, although a bit small, had some great options that I think anyone could pick from.  Their drinks blew everything else out of the water!  The Lowrider (90% sure that's what I ordered lol) was rich, flavorful, and just strong enough to leave me feeling warmer than when I arrived.I jumped for the pulled pork tacos, which--although the three tortillas look small--the portions of meat and salsa are very generous.  The rest of the table ordered just about every other entree on the menu, and I didn't hear anything but ""mmm""s and ""yum""s the entire night.  Although they were very busy, the staff checked in with us periodically throughout our reservation and made our time there very enjoyable.  Looking forward to a round two soon!,We walked in on a Sat night and grabbed drinks at the bar while we waited. Was dimly light and super vibey inside, can see it being a great date spot. Drinks: we got the daywalker, california cooler, and pinot noir. the california cooler was so refreshing and yummy. all of the cocktails sounded amazing!Two piece fried chicken: this was all of our fav dish tonight! came with 2 giant pieces of boneless fried chicken thighs drizzled in sriracha maple syrup. the chicken was incredibly juicy and crispy, which complemented well with the kimchi mac n cheese and mexican style cheese cornGochujang crispy wings: was so crunchy that it was a bit hard. loved the sweet and savory flavor and not spicy at allSquash: beautiful presentation but was honestly so confused what i was eating. i think it was roasted squash on a bed of firm tofu. wish the  squash was more cooked and unsure about the flavor combos, but not bad Double cheeseburger: seemed pretty standard. came with nicely seasoned fries,Super cute spot in an area with a lot of local restaurants and bars. There is not a lot of seating, so a reservation is definitely suggested. We had one, and there was a separate checkin line, so that was nice. We were seated right on time.The indoor seating is tight. We were next to a party of 7 I believe. It was almost like we were part of their party, so if tight seats are not ok, maybe request an outdoor table. Those had plenty of room and had heaters.They had a special holiday cocktail menu when we went. I ordered the hot drink, which was perfect for the rainy day. Between us 2 we ended up getting the duck fat fries, wings, and the smoked tuna dish. The fries were good - nice and crispy - but I probably wouldn't get them again unless we were sharing with more people. It's a large portion, and in hindsight, I would have rather tried another small plate instead. The wings were good, with a hint of sweet and spice. The smoked tuna was interesting. I don't think I have ever had something I could compare it to. It still had the texture of something like a poke, but tasted like it was cooked. Definitely worth a try. Loved the chewy farro as an alternative to rice.Our server was very friendly, even though she seemed very busy. Overall everything was great. Good value and some unique options. Smaller menu, but good variety, with items for picky eaters too. I would love to come back and try something on their regular cocktail menu and some of the other food options.,Walked in on a Tuesday for a quick drink at the bar. Bar seats were full but the hostess was able to set me up in a standing area. Horsefeather is doing a holiday themed menu for the month of December so wanted to give it a try. Drink: Rebel without a Clause - very spirit forward, sweet and  definitely boozy, garnished with a dried orange slice and biscoff cookie. Not quite what I was expecting from the description so a bit disappointed. Service: I think they usually don't have guest in the standing area so it was a bit challenging getting service. Overall, this visit was a bit lackluster. Have visited on other occasions and gotten better service, food and drink so may come back for other items on the menu and make a reservation if you want a seat.,Finally tried what I feel like is the #1 go-to date spot in SF. We pivoted to come here somewhat last min for drinks/din. I'll give the drinks experience a 5/5 and the food experience a 3/5. My cocktail (the low rider) was amazing, so great I ordered two. The food was ok. We started with fries, then got the fried chicken, caesar pear salad, and the tuna. The fries and fried chicken were good, but the salad was so lack luster and the tuna contained more tomatoes than tuna. The ambiance is very date-y. Seriously, it's super dark in there. The tables are a tad too cozy and they really seat you right next to the person next to you. All in all I had a great time, would come back for the drinks but not the food.,I mainly came here for quick drinks. They had tasty options! I usually try to for something citrusy or refreshing so I would recommend the daywalker and california cooler. I also got the pork tacos as a little snack and they were so tasty! The place is a bit cramped and it gets a little loud so just something to keep in mind!,I've been to Horsefeather twice and this second time was exactly what we were hoping for. This is a perfect dates + bite restaurant, the first time we came for dinner and felt the menu was not expansive enough.My friend says this is her first date spot - I see why! The cocktails are delicious, the atmosphere is nice inside and parklet, and the bites are perfect to share.The duck fat fries were so good, we ordered twice! I'd skip the wings next time. We practically tried every drink on their menu among the six of us, the favorites were 'Ol Smoky and the Americana.My star rating:5  - must go!!! 4 - liked it, give it a try!3  - it was alright2  - I probably won't go back 1  - turnaround and run,This was my first time at Horsefeather, and it was terrific! The cocktails were fantastic, and the service was excellent. On the holiday cocktail menu, I had the drink on the left called the ""Feeling Pine,"" My friend ordered the glass on the right, I believe, ""All Spruced up."" I am defiantly coming back to try more cocktails and some of the food menu choices (which, sadly, I did not get to try). I fell in love with the ambiance.,Best fries in the city. Also figured they discontinued vegetarian tacos which were previously on the menu, they were really good.,No reservation for a last-minute dinner with a visiting friend - luckily there was no wait for the outdoor seating which was actually surprisingly warm/insulated with the heat lamps! Notes on food: - Duck fat fries, house favorite as the server described - met my expectations for sure! - Tuna mala cucumber (? Forget the exact name of the dish) - was pleased to find that it was raw tuna/like a spin on poke, with spicy cucumber and grains. Found myself reaching for more and more bites of this one! - Gochujang crispy wings - solid wings but just not as satisfying as eating true Korean fried chicken at a Korean fried chicken restaurant.- Petite summer squash - beautifully presented with a warm rainbow of colors. However, I was unfortunately not a fan of the flavors (but my friend was!).I'll need to come back for cocktails!,Stopped by here for my birthday and loved the aesthetics, the plant walls were adorable and love that they have an outside part, semi outside part, and inside. They have ledges you can stand at inside but it gets way too packed when there's people standing at them. The drinks were all good, they're super creative n delicious. And even though I was so full, the duck fat fries were so good I had to keep eating. Definitely coming back to try other items!,Walking up to the establishment, my friend who had previously studied the menu relayed to me everything she had learned. From what I'm hearing, it sounds like we're about to go eat a hodge podge of elevated bar food. The order: Moroccan spiced carrots, duck fat fries,   pulled pork tacos, poke bowl, wagyu roast, and to my aforementioned friend's excitement and planning, the gochujang wings (along with a variety of drinks for four people)The food came out in such a sheer swiftness, that I felt almost overwhelmed with abundance at our outdoor table. I also felt overwhelmed by how loudly the man seated next to us could belt out a laugh. With the food and drink being so top notch, it was hard to pick a favorite, but we all agreed that the fries and poke bowl reigned supreme. However, at the bottom of the pyramid (said in the voice of Dance Mom's Abby Lee Miller) were the tacos. ""I wish the secondary flavor of the wing was in the taco,"" described one of my friends when speaking about the under seasoned tacos.Somehow still hungry, we went for the Whisky Butter Cake, which ended up being a strong contender for the top of our pyramid. Bonus bathroom review- I loved the color palette and decor of the wash closet. I was transported into a redwood forest on the California coast. Also, as I walked back to our street-side table, I realized how easy it would be to just walk into a restaurant and use a bathroom if I was out and about. Who are they to know if I'm a rando or someone seated outside?,We came here on a weekend night with no reservation and were able to get seated at an outdoor table pretty quickly! I loved the vibe of the place - very cute and classy and a highlight of that block of Divis. I got the Chicken Katsu Sando and the Duck Fat Fries to share. Overall, the food was decent, but the flavor and seasoning were just average, so I didn't really want to finish it all. Maybe it was because a lot of it was fried though. I'll definitely return to try out some more items on the menu!,The inside of this place is aesthetically beautiful, love the air plants in the entrance.  We had the 3 borrachos from the holiday menu & it's a 10/10 if you enjoy a good mezcal/tequila drink, don't hesitate to order this one. My friend got a good ol mezcal sour & we enjoyed an order of duck fat fries, really well seasoned! Shout out to our bartender Margaret who was very friendly/welcoming. Can't wait to be back to try more of the holiday cocktails & food.,Came in without reservations on a Tuesday night and was seated right away :)Did not have any food Drinks were solidAmbiance is loud but achieves a nice intimacy with the lighting and decorService friendly and quick Definitely a wonderful little spot to grab drinks :),tl;dr: vibe-y spot on divis with tasty food @ standard SF dinner pricing, perfect for a date night or just to grab food before heading over to emporium wait time: made a reservation beforehand so we didn't have to wait, the walk up line had a few people waiting but it didn't look too bad! for reference this was ~7:15 on a friday night service: was a little difficult flagging down a waiter to order & then to eventually get the check but it was very busy and they did seem a little short staffed so i won't fault them ambiance: lots of people, good energy! dim lighting & it looked like a very popular first date spot. We sat indoors in the little atrium area but there's also plenty of outdoor patio dining available. the tables were a liiittle close to each other & our table was right under a heat lamp (indoors!) so it got a little toasty food:duck fat fries w/ curry ketchup ($8): good texture! fries were super crispy but still soft inside. it was a surprisingly big portion despite not seeming that big initially. didn't taste much duck in terms of flavor but the fries were well seasoned & especially tasty paired w/ the curry ketchup. the curry ketchup was different and the curry flavor wasn't too strong but went a long way! (4/5)katsu sando ($16): really good! honestly 1/2 of the sandwich + some fries were enough to fill me up. the bread was pillowy soft & the katsu was perfectly crunchy! really liked the pickles that cut through and didn't make the meal feel too heavy/greasy (4.25/5)poke ($18): pretty decent portion, the wonton chips that came with it were v addicting, poke tasted very fresh (4/5)pro tips: reservation is through Resy & make sure you cancel at least 2 hours ahead of time if you're no longer about to make it, otherwise you will be charged $10/person overall: tasty food in a great location with fairly standard SF pricing, would want to come back to try some of the other food options as well as some of their drinks!,I came here for brunch on sunday and found plenty of seating in their shaded outdoor patio area. I ordered the katsu sando and duckfat fries which came with curried ketchup. I thought the sando was a great amount, but it lacked sauce and flavor. If it had katsu sauce and kewpie mayo, I definitely didn't have enough of it compared to the contents of the sando. I ended up using the curried ketchup for the fries, which was probablymy favorite part of the whole meal, to add flavor to the sando. The duckfat fries themselves didn't really taste that impressive either. The ketchup was definitely important to use as dip (there's a pattern here).,What a fun night! First things first, when you arrive you'll notice two lines, one for reservations and one for no reservations. We didn't have a reservation so we checked in the no-res line and placed our name on the waitlist for a table. We walked a block over to enjoy a beer at The Page while we waited. We got the text that our table was ready. Once we settled in the dining room, it's a very lively and energetic space. They have lots of great food options. I had the fried chicken and wow, I'd come back just for the chicken because not only was it crispy, the boneless thighs were juicy and had great flavor that mixed so well with the spice from the kimchi Mac and cheese, and the Mexican style corn. Yum! My friends had the double cheeseburger, which he said was very juicy and substantial. The heirloom tomatoes with tofu were beautiful and refreshing. For drinks, the ol Smokey was interesting! I felt like it was a twist on an old fashioned with aromas that were so different and spicy. Our friend's martini kept having to be sent back but otherwise, their current Pinot Noir is chocolates goodness.This is a fun place to have dinner with friends, and I'm definitely coming back and bringing others to enjoy!,Came for an early dinner and drinks on a Friday night. Very cute vibes and love the plant decor. There are a lot of options to cover different dietary restrictions which is good. I got the tofu and balsamic tomatoes that came over beet root hummus. One person got a poke bowl and one person got a poke bowl without tuna (we asked to sub tofu but they couldn't modify). The final member of our party got the risotto. The food was good...but not especially noteworthy. Plated well and it is colorful but portions are not that big and it was missing a depth of flavor. Regardless, I would come back for the vibes with a group who have a range of dietary restrictions.,We love horsefeather! And their burgers are amazing! Such a fun place 10/10 recommend,This was a great choice for brunch, I just wish we could have been seated inside. While my wife opted for wine with her meal my son and I had the Maria Pastor - two each and they were potent and delicious.We chose the Breakfast Burrito, Double Cheeseburger with an added fried egg (they forgot the egg) and the Chicken Katsu Sando, also with a fried egg (they got this one right). Just to top off the over the top meal we ordered a side of Duck Fat Fries. Everything was excellent.,Came here on a Monday for a 1-month celebration (trying to stay true to my Korean roots lol), and so happy we came.I was expecting tiny portions just like every other SF restaurant, but every plate was huuuuuuge. If you order three plates, you'll have leftovers.The gochujang wings were just okay, the duck fat fries were delicious, and the pork tacos were A+. Throw in drinks (I was pretty happy with my highball) and you'll run out with a tab of about $50pp including tip.The place was at full capacity, and the ambiance was just the right amount of buzzing, which was surprising for a Monday night. There's also outside seating with plenty of heat lamps!Recommended for a first date if you're an extrovert, or a second/third date if you're an introvert that needs a little more time to access your excitable side :). The lighting inside is the perfect amount of dim if you want to fling sultry eyes at someone.,Gorgeous restaurant and bar where you feel like you're in a greenhouse if you're sitting in the patio area - so fun and intimidate My favorite was the dessert, a simple, delicious, beautiful, crispy on the outside, brown butter cake The servers were kind and attentive Drinks were fun and tasty, and creative, differentiated. For the whiskey lovers (like me), there are quite a few whiskey options and you even have Japanese whiskey to choose from, should you like For dinner I've tried the fried chicken and it's a staple. Would say that overall the menu is slightly Asian inspired, which I appreciatedWould want to come back for brunch Horsefeather is a great spot for girlfriend dates, dates, or just because you want a fun vibe! Highly recommend,We loved the cocktails here! The Lowrider, with mezcal and hibiscus, and the Apres Ski, with cucumber and dill aquavit, were both complicated and delicious. I can't wait to try others! The food was mostly good. The heirloom tomato/marinated tofu/beet hummus was super beautiful, earthy, and delicious. The carnitas tacos were thick, meaty, and honestly a little messy. I wish I liked the braised wagyu beef cheeks more, but wanted a bigger punch of flavor from them. But whatever the ""chili umami seasoning"" is on the duck fat fries really made up for the beef's lack of flavor.,Visited on a random tuesday and It was packed! We gave up waiting for Nopa and found this place. I really liked the vibe, staff, music, and everything! The menu was pretty creative ex) kimchi mac and cheese. We ordered the pulled pork tacos and the fried chicken. They were both pretty average and bland, not very impressed. But i still thought it was unique that they had this subtle umami/cinnamon-like hint on their fries/chicken.,A colleague treated me to Sunday brunch here recently. She made reservations for us to sit on the covered patio up front. We ended up having to wait about 30 min for a table to free up despite the reservation, but it was fine - we had time, and spent it at the bar chatting and having cocktails. My colleague comes here often and she commented that they were probably short staffed because we also had to flag the servers down a few times to ask for refills and extra napkins. She had the avocado toast and some Cosmos and I opted for the smoked trout scramble and the Jack of Roses cocktail. I enjoyed my scramble which was flavorful and perfectly seasoned. First time I didn't have to add salt to my eggs. And the bread - the BREAD!!!!!! (Firebrand rye toast) - so delicious. If I didn't get full so fast I may have ordered another serving. We also shared the duck fat fries with curry ketchup - a bit undercooked. They were more limp than crispy, but still tasty - we ended up having to eat them with forks cause they were so soft. I plan on coming back to have some small plates and try more of their cocktails. It's a charming space and their menu varies a bit.,Cool place to get food late night. The burger is the best thing on the menu. I added everything you could add and it was amazing. I wish it came with fries instead chips tho. The fried chicken is okay. The poke bowl is no good. The marinated olives are good but served hot and taste better after they cool off.,I've lived up the street for over a year and always walked by but finally went this weekend with my mom. We got cocktails and sat outside in the parket. They had great heating and it was very comfortable. I usually don't drink cocktails (I prefer beer) but tried Lowrider and it was great and my mom l said her lemondrop was delicious. I would come back and try the food and more drinks!,Come for the drinks, skip the food. First off, I loved the ambiance of this place -- their little seating area at the front of the restaurant is perfect for the unpredictable SF weather. Inside is a nice dark wooden bar setup. All of the drinks we tried were great, major kudos to their bar staff! Cali cooler and day walker were our favorites, but they were all tasty and unique. Good definitely left something to be desired but would come back in a heartbeat for the drinks. If you're there for brunch, I do have to say the burritos looked promising.,The ambience is a little louder than I was expecting. Went for the holiday drinks and it was so good! Food was larger portions than I was expecting. The fries are so good and are even good the next day,I have been to Horse Feather twice and this second time was exactly what we were hoping for. This is a great Dates + Bite restaurant, first time we came for dinner and felt the menu was not extensive enough.My friend says this is her first date spot - I can see why! The cocktails are delicious, the atmosphere inside and parklet is nice, and the bites are perfect for sharing.The duck fat fries were so good, we ordered twice! I'll skip the wings next time. We tried practically every drink on their menu out of the six of us, favorites being the 'Ol Smokey and Americana'.My star rating:5 - Must go!!!4 - Like it, try it!3 - It was fine.2 - I probably won't go back.1 - Change and ru,We came here for brunch on a Sunday (opens at 11am) - they have a curbside patio - but it wasn't very inviting (just zero ambiance), so we asked to sit inside, we were seated at the bar.Side note here - not only do they have under bar purse hooks, but these are 3 hooks that swivel. it was just cool.They sure pump out a TON of artisanal cocktails, bless those people that can drink on a Sunday morning and still be productive. I cannot. I will say they were all beautiful, and well-crafted, but skinny glasses and lots of ice (so very little volume of cocktail)We ordered the chicken Katsu sandwich and the corned beef hash to split between the 2 of us.  I preferred the hash, the corned beef was in huge 1"" cube chunks and tender, tender, tender, there were peppers and onions in the hash along with some crispy potato.  It was topped with a perfectly cooked over easy egg (could have actually used 2 eggs).  The Katsu sandy was so large you have to anaconda yourself a bite.  It was served on thickly sliced  (and toasted) milk bread.  It was just a little too aggressively asian-ly spiced for me on a Sunday morning (I would have liked ito more for a dinner).  The Cheeseburger looked amazing.,This place is opened late and the food is great! We went to Emporium and wanted some bites. This place is a beautiful cocktail bar but offers delicious food options.We tried the poke bowl, burger/fries, and romaine salad with fennel. The poke bowl was DELICIOUS! Soooo good with the crispy wonton skins. The fish was fresh and flavorful. The burger was juicy and the salad was nice. It had a grilled flavor and it came with avocado and other veggies. Spectacular. Staff were great. I would definitely come back here for food and for drinks.,We really liked the decor of Horsefeather--it's dimly lit with lots of foliage, especially in the atrium area, which is where we were seated.We ordered a few drinks which were all surprisingly a good size, decently strong, and not overly sweet. I don't think you can really go wrong with their drinks! For food we ordered the poke bowl and the 2 Piece Fried Chicken and Sides. The poke bowl was a little disappointing because it wasn't very flavorful and came with WAY too many crisps, but the chicken was SO. GOOD. If you're a fan of fried chicken, you should definitely order this as it was packed with flavor, incredibly tender, and a great sized portion.It's very small and was crowded inside, so would definitely recommend getting a reservation beforehand!,I was pleasantly surprised by the food. Two of us ordered the fried chicken, and let me assure you, it is a decent sized portion. Two entire boneless deep fried chicken thighs. Spicy sauce. Another guy got the double burger he said it was fine, and my other friend got the Tacos.Cocktails good, good service, nice warm under the heaters outdoor seating.would go back,WEEEEKS LATER... I AM STILL THINK OF THOSE PHO TACOS (noted there's no pho about those tacos. They are just THATTT GOOOOOOOOD). This is a cozy, fun spot for dinner and/or drinks. The dim lighting indoor and outdoor totally set the mood for some special occasions at a relatively affordable price. We came on a weekday at around 7 PM without a reservation. Although we were not able to get a table inside, they were able to seat us outside under a heat lamp. The service was just fine and the food/drinks arrived at a reasonable pace. We shared the pho tacos and poke bowl. I really like the twist they added to their selections. HAVE YOU EVER HAD PHO IN A TACO? HAVE YOU EVER HAD CRUNCHY CHIPS ADDED TO YOUR POKE? I applaud them for their CREATIVITY and taste. I liked both plates =D,I greatly enjoyed dining at Horsefeather! Whether you are going for drinks or a full meal, there is a wide variety of options for everyone. I especially enjoyed the California cooler cocktail, and I order the duck fat fries every time I go without fail. Additionally, the waitress gave us her honest opinions about the menu items, which I greatly appreciated. If you find yourself in Nopa I highly recommend you stop by this trendy restaurant and bar!,Very good service.The avocado toast is so colorful and very instagrammable. It felt more like a salad though.Tomato and tofu dish was delicious.,Horsefeather specializes in being a bar and it's interesting. The interior is nice. I wanted to try their food menu and so I picked the poke. They have Asian fusion options like Korean wings. I liked the poke and it was interestingly layered and full of a kick and taste. It was a nice afternoon early dinner appetizer. This is on Divisadero.,The Asian fusion-y menu at Horsefeather looked really promising, and I was looking forward to checking them out. I made reservations a couple weeks ahead of time through Resy, and they were busy but not packed yet at 6:30pm on a Thursday; however, it started getting really busy later on in the night, and they were packed by 7:30pm. I ended up trying:-Double Cheeseburger (Chuck/Brisket Blend, Toasted Brioche Bun, Smoked Onion, Lettuce, Special Sauce, Bread & Butter Pickles, Seasoned Fries, $19, yelp.com/user_local_phot…): Good, but nothing special. Although this burger had a double patty, it was still somehow a small portion. Sadly, the fries were undercooked and slightly soggy- skip!-Pork Tacos (Fresh Yellow Corn Tortillas, Braised Pork, Salsa Verde, Red Onions, $17, yelp.com/user_local_phot…): The corn tortillas were really good, and tasted very fresh. The braised pork was just ok- it needed more flavor, and was slightly dry.-Poke Bowl (Tuna, Sushi Rice, Unagi Sauce, Spicy Mayo, Avocado, Cucumber, Crispy Wonton, Shredded Nori, $18, yelp.com/user_local_phot…): I was hesitant about ordering this, and should've gone with my initial thought. The tuna was fresh but there wasn't much of it, and the rice wasn't well cooked. The crispy wontons overpowered the dish for me, and this wasn't very good overall- skip!-Whiskey Butter Cake (Brown Butter, Shiro Miso, Mochiko, Caramel Orange Marmalade, Coconut Milk, Vanilla Bean Cream, $11, yelp.com/user_local_phot…): One of the highlights of the meal, and I really enjoyed the sear/crust on the butter cake, as well as the vanilla bean cream. The marmalade was nice and sticky, but had a slight bitter note. Our server was great, and super friendly and helpful. However, it was really difficult to flag her down once they got busier. I really appreciated that they had covered patio seating with effective heat lamps, but the tables were set very close to each other. They also had an enclosed patio type seating in the front of the restaurant, which was really nicely set up, as well as indoor seating. Parking in this area was super tough since street parking spots can be difficult to come by.,Place looked fun so my partner and I decided to check it out for drinks, which were underwhelming. We will probably not be coming back - not worth the wait.[No Reservation / Waitlist]Came here with no reservations and it was an estimated 45 minute wait. They will text you when your table is ready but unfortunately, I never received a text. My partner and I were waiting right by them too and felt like forever. Host ended up seating new arrivals with no rez right away. I was about to say something when she realized we had also been waiting a long time and asked us if we received a text - obviously not. She sat us right away outside (there had been a bunch of tables open too). What's the point of a waitlist if you're not gonna honor it... [Drinks]Drinks are $13/ea but nothing special.- Daywalker: Tasty but too sweet.- Kukui Highball: Meh. Did not taste like whiskey.- Lowrider: The hibiscus flavor did not come through and overall, meh.- Solitaire: Looked exactly like the Highball drink but with more gin. Turns out they messed up our order and gave us the Solitaire instead of a Highball so it was indeed the same drink, just made differently.[Food]Didn't come for the food but ended up ordering some duck fat fries. I don't think these fries are actually fried in duck fat because they definitely don't taste like they are. The white stuff on top is the actual duck fat. The fries are also seasoned but ours had way too much and were super salty. We were not a fan of the curried ketchup either. Duck fries sounded good at the time, but these were not good.[Service]There was only one server for the outside area - not sure if she was also working inside. Service was okay and we had to wait for awhile to order more drinks because the server wasn't outside all the time. Host service was garbage though.,I made reservations for my brother, boyfriend, and I on a Friday night. It was a good call since the place was poppin'! We got seated right away, and after looking for a few minutes on the menu, decided on Gochujang Crispy Wings, Pulled Pork Tacos, and the Braised Wagyu Roast. We all had a late lunch so we didn't order too much, but this was actually plenty for us! The wings had a great flavor and the skin was crunchy. The Wagyu roast was tender and the polenta added a nice subtle flavor to the dish. The pork in the tacos were good but the tortilla was too thick to our liking when it didn't need to be. Overall, it was a good dinner spot. My brother enjoyed the music. I knocked off a star though because it was so hard to hear each other across the table. And, it took an extra 20 mins to get the check and pay. My bf had to get up twice to find the waiter.,Came here on a Wednesday evening to grab a few drinks with friends. I heard that they had a drink that was infused with cinnamon toast crunch, so I really wanted to come here and try it. Breakfast Punch (4.5/5): This was the drink with cinnamon toast crunch! I think it's a spin-off o",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 a clarified milk punch. It was nice and clear as you c an see in the photos and tasted great. There was a subtle hint of cinnamon from the cereal. I think this was a pretty solid drink but it's definitely on the stronger side, so don't get this drink thinking you would be drinking cereal milk. Daywalker (5/5): This cocktail was topped off with an amazing foam that tasted like pineapples. This is definitely more up my alley since it's on the sweeter side. It's a drink I'd imagine drinking on a beach in Hawaii. Ol' Smokey: I won't rate this one since I only had a sip of this (one of my friends ordered this)," but it definitely nailed the """"smokey"""" taste. If you like whiskey", I think you would enjoy this drink. The cocktails were all $14, which is pretty standard for SF. Ambiance-wise, this is a really nice place to chill with friends or even with a date. They had some tables that could accommodate larger groups (we had a group of 7) as well as some seating near the bar.,Trendy dining spot with great cocktail, beer, and wine selection. Good spot for a date or small group as seating is a little tight. The risotto was really well done and the chanterelles and saffron added a lot.,When you walk in it just looks like another cute SF bar, but this food is surprisingly really good.We all started out with different cocktails that were a hit. I got the Lowrider which has mezcal in it. Great cocktail if you like smoky drinks.My boyfriend doesn't drink and he really appreciated the non-ABV drink menu so he could have a fun cocktail without alcohol.For the food, our table split the wings (ended up ordering a second order because these were that good!), braised wagyu roast which was extremely tender, the pulled pork tacos (double yum!) and the fried chicken. Honestly there weren't any negative comments about any of the dishes. They all far exceeded expectations.My only complaint is we were sitting in the very far back of the restaurant and it was still really cold back there. I wish they would have closed the door or created a wall at the front of the restaurant to stop the draft from coming all the way back. We all had our coats on the entire time which I thought was funny because we were literally the last table in the back.Would definitely come back for cocktails and light apps again!,My partner found this place first and the very next week when we were up from south bay and they couldn't wait to go back for more chicken wings.I dropped them off on a Friday night at nearly 10 and they were able to find a nice spot on the inner patio long before I parked. They knew what they wanted and before I arrived they got:Duck Fat fries. 4/5: decent enough fries," tasted like a simplot or mccains foodservice fry with a """"umami seasoning' that contains mushrooms and duckfat """"snow"""" (picture frozen duckfat run through a microplane) sprinkled on top.Heart of Romaine & Shinko Pear 5/5: the grilled half romaine heart takes on a richer character and depth of flavor. The dressing lacked acid", but the romaine was okay without. The crouton/ crostini was my favorite part and my partner decimated the lettuce.Risotto ala Milanese, 4/5: the only real disappointment. The risotto was good enough, the mushroom were fresh, but they could have been on two different plates. Maybe because we ordered GF, but it was just okay (still killed the whole bowl, so disappointed may be a vast overstatement)Gochujang Crispy Wings 5/5: This was really the reason for the visit and they lived up to the hype. My partner rallied them as a San Tung wing without gluten, but they are different enough to not be a copy, but just different. 6 crispy wing (3 drums and 3 centers) with a really rich sauce. Extra napkins were dropped right after and needed.BTW don't get me started on the napkins. it is SO nice to find a place with nice napkins. Hear me out: linen napkins are patently terrible. They are never absorbent and even the best linen company (j/k they're all terrible) can never keep them square so they are always janky. Paper napkins are almost worse as they go from stuck to you like glue to a dissolved mess that does nothing all at once. But the napkins here were heavy weight thick absorbent and kinda pretty.  All in all, it was a nice spot and a great evening and will definitely be a regular in our date night rotation.,Horsefeather always has an amazing vibe so I like to bring friends here when we're here in the city. The staff here is very kind, upbeat, & attentive. You can walk in or make a reservation. I never had an issue with seating or had to wait very long, if at all.  The menu is posted at the front and at each table via a QR code; you can also find it on their website. Drinks and food come out pretty quick, and the food is way better than other bars. Marinaded Olives ($6): I never order olives but it's so good here. It's not super oily or salty like the olives served at some Mediterranean restaurants.Duck Fat Fries ($7): I like thin fries more than the thicker ones, and you can taste the duck fat too so it was delicious! They were also crispy and remained so the entire time we were there so it's definitely a favorite.Petite Roasted Squash ($9): The flavors on this dish was pretty light so it's a good balance if you get a more flavorful/umami dish.Moroccan Spiced Carrots ($9): I like this dish more than the squash. It's also roasted instead of fried which I appreciate since I feel like most bar foods offered are fried & soaked in oil. Chicken Katsu Sando ($15): This is what blew our minds. First off, this is an American bar so we were shocked to see fusion items like this on the menu. Later on, we did confirm the Asian manager revamped the menu after he took over the bar management a few years ago so thank you  It was recommended by the waitress and it did not disappoint! The katsu was crispy and the chicken was flavorful. The breaded was buttery and toasted to perfection. It left such a great first impression, we always rave about it when we talk about Horsefeather. Domain Des Varinelles 'Dahueiller', Rose Brut ($54/bottle): I'm usually not a fan of brut since I like sweeter drinks but this was pretty good! Even the guy who doesn't drink alcohol much likes it :) I love how all their house cocktails are $13. Drinks these days are $15+ but aren't very good/strong. Jack of Roses ($13): This was good but didn't stand out to me as much as the rose brut. A Shot of Tequila: A strong, quality tequila that did me in but left no hangover,A good spot to come in for a quick bite. I got the burger and fries. It was good . Service was fast and friendly!,Horsefeather is a nice restaurant that is near Emporium, and so it's a good spot to eat dinner before you go to the barcade to start drinking. While the inside is nice, it is on the smaller side so you may have to wait for some time if you don't have reservations there. I think that my group of 6 people had to wait around 20-30 minutes for a large enough table to clear up, although they do let you wait at the bar table if there is open seating there. The waiters here are nice enough and are pretty accommodating.     For the food, I got the Fried Chicken 2 Piece and Sides along with the Duck Fat Fries. Both of these dishes were great, and I would definitely recommend them. The fried chicken was very flavorful with a good crispiness to them, while the collard greens served alongside them were delicious as well. I especially loved the duck fat fries, which were also very crispy and had a nice dipping sauce that was served with them.     Overall, I did enjoy the food at the restaurant and the prices aren't too bad either. I would try and book a reservation first, since otherwise you might wait for a while to be seated.,Ate dinner at Horsefeather with a friend. We enjoyed a poke bowl and mimosas. Then my friend ordered a double cheeseburger, and I ordered the chicken katsu sando.The time in between dishes was good. Before placing our main courses on the table, they let us complete our poke bowl. I'm grateful for that. Although I'm not a good expert, I thought the food's flavor was excellent.My friend enjoyed her burger, juicy and good portion.,Go to horse feather for their drinks! My top two recs are the good night solitaire for a cleaner gin apple chrysanthemum drink and the daywalker For a sweeter, fruitier, and frothier drink!   I also went last year and their new American / fusion foods are also good but nothing to write home about--the highlight is still the drinks,Horsefeather is just a terrific spot to catch up with an old college friend. Not crowded, but just a big enough place to feel everyone's energy in the room. We were seated and immediately got started on their seasonal cocktails. My college friend and my girlfriend both ordered the Sunset Overdrive while I ordered the Daywalker. All three drinks (Vodka & Tequila) hit us like a truck with a perfect mixture of taste and liquor. We enjoyed those first 10 minutes of selfies and laughs, then the food arrived. We ordered the pulled pork tacos, the poke bowl and the 2 piece fried chicken with Brussel sprouts and kimchi mac n' cheese. Let me tell you, order them all or at the very least, the fried chicken. Clean plates all around!,I came here on a weekday with a date, and we got lucky with a seat outside right away, no wait. The service was good, and the food came out quickly. The food didn't blow me away though. Like it was good, but I'm not in a rush to go back. The parklet is super cute, but Divis is such a busy street, that it was SO loud sometimes, I couldn't hear what my date was saying. So just be careful when eating outside, if you want to have a deep conversation. ;)I can't find my photos, but I had the poke (average 3/5), and my date got the pork tacos. He really liked them.,This place was great! Snagged a spot at the bar right when we walked in, had some amazing cocktails, we'll made by a really lovely bartender who we chatted with for an hour or so. Almost considered coming back the next night for dinner but only had a few nights in SF, but will definitely be back next time we visit!,This is a cozy little spot with both indoor and outdoor dining. Reservations are recommended, as it gets quite busy. If you're all the way in the restaurant, it's a bit dark. The food selection when we went was quite limited. Everything sounded good, but portions are a bit smaller and a bit under flavoured. Price point is a bit high for this. Service was alright. Breakfast burrito was quite lacking.Overall everything was just okay. I'm not sure this is a great spot for groups, but maybe just one on one when you're there to grab a drink.,Horsefeather is always a solid choice. The drinks are generally better than the food, which is good but doesn't thrill me. I love the outdoor area, the neighborhood and the service. We got the tomato hummus tofu thing which was pretty good, as well as the fried chicken salad. Nothing to write home about but not bad either. Love the gin drinks here which are super refreshing.,Horsefeather Ratings: 4.3/5 Food: 4.5/5 - Great food! I got the smoked trout scramble with brussels sprouts, goat cheese and herbed creme fraiche with some rye toast on the side. The scramble eggs were soft and creamy, paired really well with the trout. I think the brussels sprouts on the bottom of the dish was crispy, and definitely added an interesting twist to it. Bread was toasted perfectly. My boyfriend got the chicken katsu sando on toasted pain au lait. The panko fried chicken was juicy, tender, and well-seasoned with spices. It was crispy and had a nice katsu sauce on it, especially the pickled that comes with it was fire. We also ordered duck fat fries on the side, which taste a lot like the McDonald's fries, but the curried ketchup and umami seasoning was bomb, had a smoky duck flavors to it, but the fries could do a bit more crunch to it. There's also feta cheese on top of it as well. Solid brunch spot. Ambiance: 4.25/5 - Cozy little spot with indoor and outdoor seating area located in NOPA, right next to Emporium. There's a lot of space outdoor and be buzzing with people walking by. When you walk in the restaurant, there's the atrium where they use lots of cute plants as decor and huge glass ceilings. Then, the actual indoor seating has a full cocktail bar, dimly-lit with a nice view of the entire place. I think it's the perfect spot in the house, especially if you wanted a more intimate vibe to it. I had a good brunch with my boyfriend for sure. Price: 4/5 - Ordered an appetizer, the duck fat fries to share with my boyfriend, and two entrees for a total of $52 after taxes and tips. The fries were $7, his chicken katsu sando was $15, and my smoked trout scramble was $18. Great value and portion, we couldn't even finish everything and had to take some back home. Service: 4.25/5 - Got seated right away on Sunday afternoon for brunch. Our server was nice, welcoming, and friendly. She brought us water right away and provided some recommendations as well. Food came out fairly quick and was super delicious. Overall, they were all very attentive and had a great experience. BLUF: Recommend the duck fat fries and chicken katsu sando, and make sure to make a reservation before you go. But all in all, a great place to start a nice night out in NOPA. Looking forward to return again for lunch or dinner and some of their signature cocktail drinks.,A decent dining experience.  The space is well decorated and the service is nice.  The food was decent but nothing too spectacular. The duck fat fries were too salty with whatever orange seasoning they had. The mushroom dust on top,  although interesting,  has no flavor. The short ribs were tender and the grits were cheesy. Probably some of the better grits I've tried. The risotto was tasty and didn't taste like a porridge like 'Beretta' tends to do. My first time trying hen of the woods mushroom and disappointed to find out it doesn't really taste like chicken like I've been told. The squash appetizer is just roasted squash with dollops of goat cheese.  Nothing too hard to replicate at home. And the poke bowl has seasoned rice,  cucumbers,  tuna,  and masago. Tasted ok,  but for the price they should just add in some avocados. Nice dining experience but not really excited to return.,My go-to bar in SF!Ambiance 5/5Outdoor dining: they have a great outdoor set up with tons of space and even though it's outside, the buzz of everyone inside and out makes it feel like you're not missing out by being outside.Atrium: Gorgeous! This is my favorite place to sit. The Atrium has clear ceiling panels and two huge heaters on top.Inside: Everything you'd want in a bar. Dimly lit, nice buzz going but enough space to move around. The booths in the back are the best seats in the house.Food/Drinks 5/5Drinks: I've pretty much had everything by now and have yet to try anything I didn't enjoy.Food: Big winner! It's hard to find a bar with great drinks and great food. This place has both.  Duck fat fries, squash with goat cheese, and katsu sandwiches?! Sign me up.,This is my favorite neighborhood bar! Lots of outdoor patio seating- usually pretty poppin but can snag a spot.My FAVORITE drink here is the California Cooler ($13). I've tried the other popular ones, but I truly love the California Cooler the best.I've gotten food here and some of my favorites include the Chicken Katsu Sando ($15 + $2 egg). This doesn't feel like traditional japanese chicken katsu, but a bit americanized- still soooo delicious though. I also get the duck fat fries ($7) which are good to snack on. I also really like the Petite Summer Squash ($9)- a nice, simple side to get some Veggies. The Summer Melon Salad ($16) is also super refreshing and light. Overall, this is my favorite bar on divis and one of my favorite post- work spots in the city!,We enjoyed the restaurant. The food was good, and the environment has an intimate vibe that is perfect for the Valentine's Day. We started with the wings and some drinks. They came pretty fast. The we ordered an main dish for each of us. We love sharing food, and I rank the 2 piece fried chicken is the best, then the burger, the poke bowl, and the taco at the last. The taco can be more flavorful and the sheet can be a bit more crunchy. One thing I will say for the service. They were very aggressive when they came to take the plates away. I recommend this place.,A really cute neighborhood bar that's always lively, serves amazing cocktails, and has a great selection of beer and wine. Theres usually a wait on week nights as well, but if you opt for the bar top you'll be seated fairly quickly. Perfect for a night out or date night!,Amazing for late night eats and drinks. We got seated on a Sunday night at 10pm and got to enjoy the California Cooler very refreshing and the Poke bowl which was scrumptious!! We were seated outside bc my friend forgot to bring Vax card but the heated lamps kept us warm,I really liked the environment and service was good. I ordered avocado toast and driver's cup (a mocktail). The avocado toast was okay, I wasn't impressed much. It was kinda cold. And I didn't like the mocktail. It was watermelon and cucumber and I didn't like cucumber in a drink. I think they should remove cucumber. And their bathroom lighting is very dim, they should change that.,My friends and I came to Horsefeather for dinner. On the plus side, the ambiance is cute. On the minus side, the food and service were mediocre.,Lowrider and a little duck fatDropped in on after leaving a taco Tuesday based on a recommendation.Duck fat fries could be a little more duck a little more fat Drinks are light as a feather but flavors are heavy as a horse. I wouldn't dare come on a weekend with the crowd this kind of ambience can bring,Super cute spot with good small bites and cocktails! A bit on the pricier side but the food is good quality with decent portions- make sure to order the duck fat fries. If you want to sit in the cute outdoor greenhouse area, I recommend making a reservation ahead of time,Did not know about this place until I was invited for a social night! Indoors is beautifully done with blue tones and plenty of plants. We sat outdoors and there were heat lamps to keep everyone warm. Service was good. There were moments where it did feel a bit slow but it could be that we sat outside (which means extra walking distance) and they were understaffed. Overall, the service was super attentive (came by a few times to ask if everything was good and clear tables) and ambience was great. Got the Driver's Cup - which is the bartender's choice in making a non-alcoholic version of their cocktails. The one I got was a nice refreshing cucumber mocktail. Love when a restaurant puts mocktails on the menu. Chicken Katsu Sando - can't really go wrong with a chicken katsu sandwich. Loved the flavors and I need their pickles recipe! Crispy chicken (maybe a bit dark but that could be the batter they chose?) and portions were perfect. Looking forward to coming back and seeing what they have for brunch or trying their other items.,Super fun restaurant on Divisadero with a great variety on the menu and really good drinks. I got the day walker to drink which was topped with a really tasty foam. Also shared the pulled pork tacos that were packed with flavor and deliciously juicy. Great atmosphere and vibe on the inside and a great place to start your night out!,Came here on a Saturday night and had a reservation. Even though we showed up a few minutes late they still seated us with no issues. I got the pulled pork tacos and my friend got the gochujang wings and duck fat fries. I did not like my tacos. I thought they were soggy and not flavorful at all. However, the duck fat fries won me over. Whatever seasoning they put on it was delicious, high in umami flavors. I tried a wing as well and thought it was delicious. Overall, although I would not return for the tacos, I would come back for those fries.,This place disappointed me, but not for reasons one would expect. If I had to summarize my experience," just know """"you have 90 minutes"""". First round went fine", we got California Cooler was probably the best of the 4 that were ordered.Here's the description: spring 44 gin, thyme sauvignon blanc syrup, celery juice, fresh lime, sparkling cremant. Celery juice was pretty forward but added interesting complexity.We ordered duck fat fries, they were fine.Atrium has an aesthetically pleasing plant-forward decor. Indoor has cool flooring. Botanist Gin bottles are their decanters, which I've always liked that bottle design.The part of the experience that overshadowed everything was the lack of customer service or poor table side manner. I don't know what was wrong with our server, but she seemed super cold, impatient waiting for us to make a selection and didn't want to be bothered. All she was good at was mentioning we have to be out by a certain time, never asked if we wanted more water, never asked how things were going, she was less than passable for customer service.What's more interesting is due to the space being pretty intimate and you can hear everyone (in the atrium at least), and I didn't hear the other two parties being reminded. I just didn't like feeling rushed AND feeling like I was bugging the girl to get a second drink. Maybe she was having a bad day?Furthermore, if in fact there's a time cap, wouldn't it make sense to actively check on the patron so you can add items to the tab? They weren't exactly cranking out the drinks very quickly, so that time expired fairly quickly.In conclusion, California Cooler was good, parking might be challenging, one particular server either was having a bad day or she sucked at customer service (or maybe just didn't like us), you have 90 minutes but may or may not be reminded of that. I don't know if there's some sort of rule preventing establishments from doing so, but if there isn't, I recommend a 2 hour time limit.,Horsefeather is a small-ish, modern, cozy cocktail bar along Divisadero offering a selection of unique cocktails and bar bites. The setting is nicely decorated, though as some reviewers have mentioned, it may be a good idea to reserve a table ahead.I was excited to try some of their cocktails, but didn't find the one I got (Kukui Highball) to be particularly riveting. Same with my friend's (blanking on the name of hers). It may have been due to the ones we selected, but I didn't think they were anything special. With respect to food, I got the pulled pork tacos and my friend got the fried chicken. We also shared the duck fat fries. I think these are the kinds of foods that feel good in the moment because you're hungry, but they were pretty standard/meh for SF standards. Overall, the location and decor were bigger draws for me than the taste of the food or drinks. That said, might be tempted to return at some point and see if there are more exciting menu items to give a shot.,We made a reservation on Resy since well, it's SF on a Sunday and you just never know. They do require a CC and have to pay $10/person if reservation missed - we were only 15mins or so late, which they were very understanding of (thank you, Fams!). Their cocktail menu looked so good and wanted to try everything but got one drink - Daywalker - tequila based, quite scrumptious. Along with the food - stuffed french toast with a side of fried chicken (please do yourself a favor and get it because it was one of the juiciest chicken EVER), corn beef brisket (with tots!! Like fancy tots), and duck fat fries (could have used more crunch but overall solid). Can't wait to be back! Really enjoyed the outdoor seating. Well done, Horsefeather, thank you again!,I went here a few weeks back for a friends birthday and felt I needed to leave a review. The drinks were great and the wait staff was kind, but the host was extremely rude throughout our whole experience. Our group was about 10 people and we're all about 25 years old - this was our first bar, we were sober and respectful. She treated us like we were 16 and didn't belong there and we all left feeling like we never wanted to go there again.,2/5I was really disappointed with my experience at Horsefeather. A friend recommended it to us after he had a great date there and so we were really excited to go grab some drinks before heading to Emporium on a Friday night, admittedly one of their most busy nights of the week I'm assuming. It was a group of 6 so for a large party, I wanted to make a reservation. I emailed them ahead of time to do that but was told for a party of that size we would have to accept a cost per person of $45. We weren't looking for that this evening so I kindly declined. They told me that we would be able to walk up to the bar with a party of that size and stand which seemed alright to me!Cut to the Friday night, we were there around 8 pm. I went to the walk-in line and after how long of a wait for a table of 6 would be if they had any. They informed me it would be an hour and we said that was fine and went to Emporium to play some games and wait. They texted us within 20 minutes telling us our table was ready so we walked back (within 5 min) to be seated. They seated us at the worst table, the furthest one away outside. It was freezing outside and they did not have a heat lamp to provide us with when we asked (told to us with a slight attitude as well). After we sat down, our waiter seemed frustrated we weren't ready to order when he came up and didn't acknowledge our orders when we said them out loud. He instead gave us more attitude. Keep in mind, this whole time my entire group was being very respectful. There was also absolutely no room at the bar for a group of 6 to stand in so I'm not sure why the person I talked with via email would even suggest that.They also didn't inform us of the 25% gratuity on a group of 6 beforehand and we ended up paying around $100+ for a total of 5 drinks while we were freezing in the cold. It was extremely disappointing. If they had a better table available we were willing to wait the full hour, as we were told at the start.I'm usually very forgiving of places and staff because I know how hectic of a job it is, however, this was just a very disappointing experience especially when I was so ready to love this place.The two stars are for the good drinks and the fact that the vibe inside was nice if you go in a smaller group and make a specific indoor reservation.,Milk Punch ReviewBreakfast Milk Punch: Corn Whisky, Jamaican and aged rums, spices, citruscinnamon Toast crunch $14This was one of the first milk punches I tried in the city thanks to the pandemic and getting it delivered. Too bad that cocktails delivery got turned off since milk clarified cocktails are so shelf stable. Really tasty milk punch. Definite staple on their menu and Try to get some whenever I'm in the area.,Food isn't standout but it's better than typical bar food. Reservations are usually pretty easy to come by, so a good last minute spot for catching up with a friend or having a date. Not a spot to go out of your way for, but a good option if you're in the neighborhood. The katsu sando I got was surprisingly enjoyable, not the best rendition I've had (that will go to Golden Diner in NYC) but pretty solid. My friends seemed less impressed by their entrees - they got the cheeseburger and the pho tacos.,The Horsefeather is definitely the place to go if you want some good, tasty food and a good service. I came here with some friends just to try it out and we ended up loving the place.,This was a fun spot for dinner with friends, and great value! They take reservations, which makes getting a table a snap. Really enjoyed the Pho Tacos, which had seasoned beans with flavoring reminiscent of pho--I've never had a vegetarian taco like that before and it was really good! The poke bowl was tasty, too, though they go heavy on the crispy noodles, if that's not your thing. The drinks were on the variable side. The Wall Street, which has bai jiu and a slew of other ingredients, was surprisingly good. Breakfast Punch was just...not what I was expecting? Kind of harsh. I forgot the other cocktails we got, but they were better! The one with a slice of pineapple was like a tiki drink and it was very good. Overall, great experience!,I've gone to Horsefeather a few times and always had a pretty decent experience. The drinks are good and I've always been satisfied with my food. The cheese burger and chicken wing appetizer are so tasty and probably will still be the reason I come back despite what is coming next in my review. So, I knew I liked this place so I took my parents here while they were visiting. When I say our waiter was grouchy... I mean she seemed genuinely unhappy to the point where it was uncomfortable for all of us. My dad asked a question about the whisky and she basically scoffed at him and said to look at the menu if he had questions. I was so embarrassed by her attitude because again it made everyone uncomfortable and it was my idea to have gone there. I'm really disappointed with the original server, I know sometimes people have bad days but that's never an excuse to be rude.TLDR: good food, hit or miss service.,Horsefeather has been on my radar for some time and we had dinner and drinks in their parklet with some friends recently. I began with the Breakfast Punch, which as the waiter mentioned was different from a conventional cocktail: the mix of rum, lemon, cinnamon, and other spices was unique (a comment I make in a non-valenced way) and refreshing. I liked the Ol' Smokey better, the warm whiskey with the cardamom was both tastier and more familiar. In terms of food, it was good. We shared duck fat fries, which I'm not sure it's possible to complain about. They came out hot and were thin and crispy (vs. a thicker steak-type fry) and the curry flavor was subtle and welcome. For my entrée I ordered the pulled pork tacos, which the chefs 100% nailed: the natural flavor of the pork came through and was well balanced with the spices in which they braised it. The house-made salsa verde was shockingly delicious - a fresh, almost sweet flavor that brought the tacos to the next level. I would absolutely order these again. My gf had the cheeseburger, which was fine (although it came with mayo, contrary to how she ordered it, which meant I tasted it less than I might have otherwise) - it evoked no further descriptive inspiration in me. It might have been nice to have a wider range of dessert options than a ginger cookie (less for me than the aforementioned gf). All in all, it was a nice night out!,A fabulous experience. Great food, creative cocktails. We tried the fried chicken meal, it was so good! Similar to some of the best Korean Fries Chicken I've had before. The corn and collards on the side were stars too. Our favorite cocktails were the Moonranker, Ramblin' Mandarin, and the Breakfast Punch.,The petite squash was one of the best vegetable dishes I've ever had- definitely a stand out dish. The combinations of squash with the creamy goat cheese is fantastic. The fried chicken was also very good, with fantastic collard greens. The Wagyu roast was good, but nothing incredibly special.,Great staff and service. Duck fat fries are a good choice. The physical seating outdoors was ok but we didn't have to wait too long.,We immediately sat down and, after looking at the menu for a few minutes, settled on the crispy gochujang wings, pulled pork tacos, and braised fried wagyu. We all had a late lunch so we didn't order too much, but we actually had enough! The wings tasted good and the skin was crispy. The Wagyu roast was tender, and the polenta gave the dish a nice subtle scent. The pork in the taco was excellent, but the tortilla was too thick for our taste when it wasn't needed. All in all, it was an excellent place for dinner. My brother enjoyed music. I took off a star because it was very difficult to hear each other at the table. And it took another twenty minutes to purchase the check and pay,The cocktails are pretty good (and the ambiance) but the food is just alrightI got the burger and my friend got the chicken Katsu sando and we both thought our food was alright. The duck fat fries are interesting but also not amazing,Experiencing Horsefeather left me feeling like all this time I've been drinking the wrong craft cocktails.My Breakfast Punch was superb and innovative to boot! Cinnamon Toast Crunch Infused Milk??? SOLD. No side of pretense or arrogance here.Went for the Duck Fat Fries for something to snack on- also yummy. Loved the subtle twist of the curried ketchup on the side.,After a long day of travel, finding this restaurant in NoPa (North of the Panhandle) was a delicious and relaxing treat. We ate in their sidewalk dining area and the service was fine. The food, on the other hand, was fantastic and colorful.,Really enjoyed a couple drinks and fries (yummy duck fat fries)! We had old fashions and enjoyed the trending house music and scene around us. The staff was friendly a, professional and helpful. Great experience with waitress Shelby too! Fun and great suggestions. We'll be back!,Food and drinks were okay. Ambience was nice overall but tables felt extremely close to each other in the terrace area. I appreciated the waiter and manager being attentive and for trying to find us a table inside the dining room.,Variety of vegetarian options on menu: 3/5Cleanliness and social distancing practices: 5/5Tons of outdoor seating and they even opened up about 25% of their indoor seating. They are so SO careful so make sure you are constantly wearing your mask except with eating and be patient with the staff as they are trying to make the space as sanitary as possible.Drinks are pretty strong but really delicious and we really enjoyed the mushroom pappardelle and spiced carrots. Root chips and salad as appetizers weren't really worth getting but we were pretty hungry. I'd probably go more for the drinks and just one bite next time.,i was visiting for a festival this weekend and stopped by with friends for dinner," the host guy (domt know his name) very nice! as well as our server """"michelle""""", so awesome, kind and very knowledgeable about the menu. shes a pro! drinks had the perfect amount of alcohol, the food?? AMAZING. now i never liked corn in my life, i got the fried chicken with corn and kimchi mac and cheese. i love kimchi, the mac and cheese was amazing. the corn?? SO GOOD. i dont even like corn!!! and i loved it.,Our group of 4 wandered around at midnight for some late night drinks and bites. After being turned away by so many because they were closing soon, we found ourselves in Horsefeather.We ended up ordering a round of drinks and some burgers, but because the kitchen was closing, we had to take the food to go. Either way, we were all glad to be able to get some food.The cheeseburger I had was so good that I regret sharing it with my boyfriend. In any case, it definitely hit the spot. The chips were a little soggy by the time we got back home, but they were good and had an interesting maple syrup taste.,Great place to get brunch on the weekends, especially Sundays bc they have a decent sized outdoor parklet. They have a great selection of cocktails and a variety of food. Their fried chicken cutlet is very juicy so get it either in their sandwich or top it on a salad or just order it on the side. The French toast is different bc it is a croissant and it's light. It will be a bit noisy in the parklet but it is on Divisadero street which is a busy street but you can opt to sit in their atrium at the front which still is closer to the outdoor even though it's covered. They've got a full bar so you can order any cocktail that is not on the menu and I am sure the bartenders will come up with great concoctions.,We needed to have an early dinner so that our niece could get on the road home on a Sunday. No problem getting a reservation for an outside table at 4 PM. Waitress was wonderful, food was very good. Braised Waghu Roast was delicious. Two shared the double cheeseburger which pretty much satisfied both. I would totally go back. Oh, and the drinks were well done. Great weather and then we stopped by the arcade just down the street. Nice afternoon.,I want to say I'd come back again and try the food next time. Their music choice and aesthetic overall was on point. Unfortunately there was a sour taste in service with being rushed to a limited seating time. We were given 90 minutes to dine. Their drinks were good - I had the California Cooler. It was light and refreshing given the celery juice in it.,Called in and got a very cold reception from the  person who answered the phone, very unhelpful. And then when our party got there for dinner most of the staff seemed like they couldn't be bothered with us. For prices we now pay for going out, wasn't worth the hassle.,Charlie was a fantastic server and host. We found horsefeather through Yelp while looking for cute spots to grab a drink or two and we were not disappointed. Tasty drinks and an adorable quasi-outdoor garden vibe were the perfect atmosphere to kill a couple hours. Their on menu drinks are good," but the drinks the bartender came up with for us were even better! We look forward to returning for the """"Dana"""" :)""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Daeho Kalbijjim & Beef Soup,"Yommy yommy yommy is the first thing that comes to mind when I hear Daeho now. Wow, this place was good. I came here on a Sunday night with 3 other friends and waited about an hour before being seated. I recommend putting yourself on the Yelp waitlist while you're on your way over as I've heard that the wait can get up to two hours sometimes. The restaurant is right across the street from Japantown so parking might be a little difficult to find at times, but they have a parking garage close by that is only $2 an hour which is pretty cheap for SF. They called our name halfway through our wait in order to pre-order our food so that it would be ready once it would get to our table. The restaurant itself is dimly lit and noise levels are pretty loud. It's a small place, but it's clean and a great place to come with a group of 4-6. We ordered the Kalbijim and added all of the optional toppings (glass noodles, tteok, cheese, and veggies) as well as a seolleongtang. When the Kalbijim comes out, they blowtorch the cheese for like 3 minutes and it's kind of a cool show. But woo whee, the food was so good. The melted cheese went so perfectly with the tteok and short ribs. The short ribs are braised in some kind of sweet, spicy, and savory sauce and the meat was so tender that it literally fell off the bone. Every bite was just perfection and the various pickled sides they provided were a great complement to an otherwise heavy meal. The seolleongtang was also great, but needed a little extra salt and pepper. Portion sizes are huge and the Kalbijim alone is probably enough to feed 4 people.  Overall, if you're looking for a delicious meal with a small group, definitely give this place a try. Their Kalbijim is a must and is absolutely delicious! Just be prepared for the relatively long wait if you're coming around dinner time.,Daeho has always been both a local and tourist's favorite for good reason!! I came by for dinner with a few friends and we always it has always been absolutely delicious. We went on a Sunday night, so we had to wait for about an hour or so, including the time to ""pre-order"". Although the Yelp waitlist said it would take 1.5 hours, I got a call within 30 mins to order our meal, followed by an additional 20 minutes or so to get seated. It's difficult to join the waitlist on Yelp since it seems like it closes pretty early, but I would recommend getting to the restaurant early so you don't have to wait for a late night dinner! We got the classic Kalbijjim and added cheese, glass noodles, and vegetables. I always recommend adding all the toppings, especially for those who are visiting the first time, to get the full experience! Especially with the touch of the blowtorch melting the cheese! The medium wasn't as spicy as I expected and it was overall so delicious. We got the regular size for a party of 4 and we were able to finish it all, although we were completely stuffed! Overall, I highly recommend visiting Daeho if you're in the mood for some solid Korean braised short ribs! It's also great that it's located so close to Japantown, so it's easy to spend the time waiting checking out the cute stores in the area!,I'm not gonna lie, I was expecting more from this place after hearing so many good things, but all in all, it was a very satisfying meal. The line gets long very fast, so it's best to make a reservation or go right at opening time to ensure you can eat at a reasonable time. Service was decent -- Nothing spectacular, but also don't think that this kind of place needs SUPER attentive staff as long as you can flag them down. Ambiance is quite casual and family style, so it's great to go with a small group or with your family since the servings of kalbijjim are quite big. Kalbijjim is one of my favorite Korean dishes, so my standards were already skewed given that my mom made it so well when I was growing up. It was good, but I was almost expecting the short ribs to be even softer. This may just be personal preference, but I like the meat to slide off the bone, so the kalbijjim here was a bit tougher than I would've liked. By no means is the meat tough -- definitely tender -- just more of my own preference! The spice is adjustable which is great, and you can add the option to get cheese which can help with the spice if you're not too good with it. We also ordered the Galbi Tang (not pictured), which I thought was even better! Very authentic Korean dish and super flavorful broth that was perfect with the rice. Overall, really great experience, possibly not worth ALL the hype, but still really tasty, especially if you've never had kalbijjim before! I HIGHLY recommend the Galbi Tang too if you have room for it.,I have delayed coming here because of the long waits but I wish I didn't! Yelp waitlist to the rescue. Put our name down at 5:30pm for a party of 3 (when there were 50 groups ahead of us, whoa). When we arrived at 7:15 we just waited 10-15 mins, placed our order at the front and were seated in prime dinner time! Food was a no brainer - regular short rib with cheese on top. Just yes. Seafood bibimbap and peach soju were also A+We had to share a table with another group but we didn't mind at all. Will definitely be back.,Came here during the weekday and there were plenty of seats. They make you order upfront if you want the Kalbijjim because it can take up to an hour to cook. It only ended up being about 20-30 min and they give you side dishes to start with while you wait. The first bite was great! We got the mild version and added cheese for the fire show. They light up the cheese at your table. After a while though, it started to taste a bit too sweet for me but that might just be my personal preference,Daeho is an SF classic at this point. I came here a few weeks ago with a few friends. We did wait a bit, mostly for the last two in our party to get here, but we were in line for the next 4 top. The staff were polite and quick to clean/setup our table, get us seated, and place our order.I think we got the large Kalbijjim (Braised Beef Short Rib) 갈비찜, a Spicy Kalbi Tang (Spicy Beef Rib Soup) 매운 갈비탕, and also a few bottles of soju to pair.Seeing the blowtorch never gets old (okay maybe at the 20th time) and the Kalbijjim is always our go-to. If it's your first time that would be a great safe first entree (also make sure you split). I tried the spicy soup for the first time and was pleasantly surprised.Even with the large, we were stuffed full with more Kalbijjim to spare and take home. So keep in mind the portion sizes if you are ordering here for the first time!Will always come back (can't say no to Daeho). 5/5 :),One of my favorite spots in the city for Korean and definitely worth the wait. I get so excited every time I come here and the food never disappoints. Their ordering system is super efficient too as they take down your order before you sit down so you can expect your food ready as soon as you get seated a table. The braised short is my go to order but i think that's what everyone basically gets here. The meat was so tender, tasty and melts in your mouth. We ordered mild and I think that's the perfect amount of spicy if you can't take spicy. We also added cheese, glass noodle and rice cake. I think it's worth the extra few dollars to add on. We ordered large for 4 people and it was the perfect amount, plus we had leftovers. I don't usually eat rice and every time I come here I finish the whole bowl. Must try if you're in the city and although there's a wait it's worth it.,Daeho is one of my favorite Korean restaurants! We came at 10:50 AM and we were one of the last groups to be seated. The restaurant is medium in size and the table is fairly close together.  The staffs are very nice and professional and we got our drinks and banchans very quickly.- Squid Kalbijjim with cheese: 5/5The squid taste so good with the cheese and sauce and the beef is really soft and delicious- kalbi stone pot: 5/5Go very well with the kalbijjim. Rice is crispy and the beef tender.,My go-to for kalbijjim and kalbitang. I've been to their Milpitas location and the quality seems to be consistent. The wait can be pretty long on a weekend and unfortunately the waitlist is closed on Yelp. I had to pop into the restaurant and put down my name. The wait time said around 91-121 minutes but we only had to wait maybe less than an hour.I came as a party of 3, and one of my friends from out of state hearing raving reviews about here and wanted to try the kalbijjim with cheese. The kalbijjim is pretty pricey- about $80 for the regular and if you want cheese on top. I remember only 2 years ago at the Milpitas location it used to be around $50-60. Ahh, boo inflation.The meat is super tender and falls off the bone. We ordered the dish medium spicy and it was the right amount of kick to it. My friend was in love with the dish! We also ordered the kalbitang, which was also pretty great.It's a pretty busy place and they try to get diners in and out as fast as they can. Be warned that you may have to share tables with some strangers- we had to share a table with a party of 2. Service was pretty decent though.,Delicious! Pro tip is to join the Yelp waitlist (by going to restaurant and using the Yelp iPad or joining via Yelp app) an hour or so before you actually want to eat. Lines are usually 60-80 minutes.This order was for 4 people:- Braised Short Rib (got toppings +vegetables, +rice cake, and + cheese) and extra meat: we also ordered 3 purple rices (free). It was wonderful - what else can we say! The cheese on top is torched right in front of you. Beef short ribs (with some bones) are tucked under along with all the other ingredients. It's a perfect meal for a rainy day. Would want to come back to try all the other options on the menu!,Came on a Tuesday around noon for lunch and we were happy to learn that it wasn't too crowded. Add your name to the waitlist to save yourself some time.  When you check in, you have to preorder their popular dishes as they take extra time to prepare.We ordered the Kalbijjim mild with extra meat, cheese and rice cakes. Super expensive! $93 with the add-ons. The dish was good, but I wasn't blown away. I'm not a fan of cheese on my meat, but my kids like that kinda stuff. It was fun to watch them melt the cheese with a kitchen torch! The dish reminded me of Filipino caldereta because of the tomato base. There were about six pieces of short ribs, few rice cakes and hella potatoes. We split it between four of us and we were still hungry at the end. For over $90, I expected more meat...I didn't appreciate the overuse of potatoes as a filler. The banchan was pretty good. We enjoyed the pickled green onions. The purple rice was good, too. Not sure if we'll be back...way too expensive for the portion size.,The 1 hour wait was definitely worth it! We ordered the kalbijjim and modeum. The portions were huge that it fed 4 individuals with leftovers. My kids enjoyed the show during the cheese melt. The kalbijjim was so delicious and full of flavor. The meat was really tender. This was my favorite dish. On my next visit, I would like to try the kalbijjim with the squid. I enjoyed the broth for the modeum. However, the meat could of had more flavor/seasoning. This establishment offers 1 refill on the broth. This meal was very pricey. It was approximately $210. Overall, this was a really pleasant dining experience. I would dine here in the future.,We wanted to try the big kalbijim, but we decided not to because we had dinner not too long after lunch hahahaI got the kalbi tang because it's chilly out and I wanted something warm. The broth was well flavored. Not much of that short rib ""beefy"" flavor I would get from a beef soup like this. The thicker glass noodles were great. I should have asked for more of them. The beef was supperrrrrrrr tender and soft. Short rib bibimbap was pretty good. The beef was a little tough, but manageable. Sauce and everything was well flavored.We only ate the kimchi, a few of the radish, and some of the chive kimchi. I'm used to having fish cakes and cucumbers so I was sad they didn't have it.Overall, it wasn't bad. If given the chance, I would probably stop by here for the kalbijim next,Solid galbijjim spot in SF! It's definitely a small space so the wait times can get pretty aggressive! The set up of the restaurant allows you to preorder the galbijjim for the table so that you don't have to wait as long! I appreciated the efficiency! The price is definitely high but it matches their quality! I highly suggest getting the cheese as an add on especially if you like your galbijjim on the spicier side since it helps neutralize your palette!,Date of Visit: 11/22/2022My favorite Korean Kalbijim in Bay area is Daeho Kalbijjim & Beef Soup! Came here on a weekday in November and still need to wait for a long time. Definitely recommend to add to the waitlist before heading out. Cass Beer $8Doh Gal Jjinm (Beef Rib with Ox Tendon/Cartilage) $75There are four options of the Kalbijim. My favorites are the Beef Rib with Ox Tail and Beef Rib with Ox Tendon/ Cartilage. We got the one with Ox Tendon and Cartilage, and adding vegetables and cheese. Server will grill the cheese at tableside. Yang Ji (Beef Royal Brisket Seolleong Tang) $18The Seolleong Tang are very good too! Perfect match with Kalbi!,I get the galbi tang here frequently ! This place is very popular so put yourself on the yelp waitlist beforehand.My partner absolutely loves their galbijjim and I think it's pretty good, but I have had better. We have eaten galbijjim from here, the other SF location as well as the Daly City and San Mateo location so frequently.Come for the warm food and fire show before you dig into the cheesy meats.,Ordered the Kalbijjim (mild) with cheese, extra meat, thick glass noodles and purple rice. (You order #1-4 before you get seated and can order the rest at your table.)The dish came bubbling to the table with unmelted cheese scattered on top. The host used a blow torch to melt the cheese. The Kalbijjim had a slight kick to it even though it was mild. The meat and veggies were tender. The glass noodles were on the bottom and soaked up the sauce. The food was comforting and tasty.The dish was enough to feed 3 ppl with some leftovers to take home.This restaurant gets busy at dinner time. My table asked for a water refill from the host (who also served tables) and we didn't get a refill for a while since the host became busy as customers showed up.,I would like to petition to call their popular dish, crack, instead! I always crave this when it gets cold outside! Big portions, meat is super tender. We got the cartilage and tendons one day, super soft and soaked with great flavors! This dish is normally able to feed 4 people, we always add extra meat, rice cakes and clear noodles!Got the cold noodles dish before, but it was not a favorite as the kalbi Jim! Highly recommend going with a big group or a big appetite. The wait is normally pretty long during dinner time.,I LOVE Daeho!! My go-to spot in the Bay Area! Daeho is where I always take guests visiting and is always reliable for a crowd-pleaser / group dinner. I normally order the galbijjim, medium spice, with all of the toppings (glass noodles, rice cakes, and vegetables), which is normally plenty of food for 3-4 people to share. Daeho doesn't take reservations, so would recommend getting in line before opening or very early to claim a spot. The atmosphere is definitely lively inside so good for a fun vibe but might be hard to hear in certain parts of the restaurant.(would also plug Jina's Cafe in Japantown, which has a collaboration with Daeho and serves torched galbijjim croissants ),Daeho is absolutely a must try if you're in the area. I've had similar styles of Korean Kalbijjim in other places, but Daeho's is especially great. It is pricey, but the portion size is big, so one order with extra meat is good for four people. We ordered the regular Braised short rib with extra meat and cheese, and everything was so delicious. The meat also comes with two bowls of white or purple rice, or three bowls if you get the extra size. I think the mild isn't too spicy, so if you're looking for more of a kick, the medium might be the way to go.Daeho is a pretty small restaurant, so it gets pretty noisy. The line is usually quite long, so get on the yelp waitlist if you can and check in early. Even though we were 11th on the waiting list, once we checked in, they were able to get us seated within 5 minutes. You have to order ahead of getting seated, so check out the menu ahead of time and know what you want. I definitely will be coming back sometime soon.,If you are on the fence about trying Daeho, please, go. This is one of my favorite restaurants I've ever been to. Be prepared with a group and an empty stomach!I went with a friend of mine and ordered the braised short rib and ox tail with all add-ons (vegetables, noodles, rice cakes, and cheese). I underestimated how much food it really was LOL I didn't even have a chance to get to any of the noodles underneath the massive pile of food. The flavors are to die for...savory, spicy, fresh ingredients that are complimented perfectly by the melty cheese (that they torch table side!)We did the regular size with medium spice and I think with the add-ons, it could have easily fed a group of 3-4. Next time I'd like to try the spiciest level to see how hot it gets! I can't wait to come back,Very surprised that I haven't left a review for Daeho yet, considering I've recommended it to many friends and have been four times! Daeho's food is unlike other Korean food you'll find in San Francisco.  It hasn't disappointed yet and I've slowly been able to try other things on the menu too. The Soju is priced well and although the prices have risen on the Kalbijim, it's certainly worth going, especially in a group.,DAE-NNNNG DAEHO. okay, sounds like I'm cursing, but I'm really not :) hahaha. This place was DAE-mazzzing. Modern-day chefs have decided to combine the flavors of traditional Korean beef short ribs and boiling or steaming them and combining the flavors with traditional Korean rice cake!!! The perfect fusion and combo and made the dish well worth it! Be prepared to spend $$$ here though because the rice cake and other i items are extra ""add-in's"" ....also if you're a tourist like me, street parking is your best option or if you're nearby; just Uber. Parking is difficult to find, then you gotta parallel park on a steep hill. It's just not fun. We walked though because my cousin lives nearby.,Last night was my first time dining in here. I added my name on the Yelp waitlist right at 5pm for a table for 3 when they opened and I was 12th in line. By 5:20pm I got a text we were up and I checked in with the host. I love that you can preorder when you check in to save time. That's efficient! When we seated there was already 3 ban chans on the table: daikon, kimchi and a green onions mix. They all seem to have the same kimchi marinade. Wish there was other varieties. By 5:37pm, our kalbijjim arrived.  So fast! We added mozzarella cheese which is a must. They torch it at the table. The beef is always super tender and flavorful. The stone pot keeps the dish hot throughout your meal. Even at opening on a weeknight, this place is packed. I can see why.,Who are youIM no oneThe rumors are trueAll of itThis place is dope and i caked it. I went with a party of 7 at 7 and the wait wasn't that bad, only like 10 minutes but ughhhhhhhh it so good i cant stop dreaming about it Got the classic with medium spicy and all of the add ons and it was too goodParking is okay ishSoju is $12 so it's a good deal,So definitely come here for the kalbijim. Honestly the first time I came here, I didn't think anything of the meal. But as I started frequenting the restaurant more often, I found this meal to be pretty unique. Not many restaurants do the cheese and wide variety of add ons. Definitely make a reservation when you can. The line starts to form after 5 pm around dinner time. You can opt to put your name on the virtual waitlist. We added glass noodle, tbokki (rice cakes), and extra meat. We also ordered the oxtail soup because it was a cold cold day and we wanted something hot to keep the 3 of us warm. Of course get their fresh soju to enjoy a drink or two with your company. Looking forward to coming back on a cold winter day, it'll hit!,The food is delicious. Their brisket bone broth soup is perfect for a chilly sf day. The kalbijimm is expensive but good. Very cheesy and flavorful !! Definitely paying for the experience of them melting the cheese for a good 5 mins in front of you with a blow torch. Nice for groups that don't mind family style.. they allow you to add extra cheese or extra meat. We came 30 mins before opening and there was already a line of 6 parties ahead of us. Once they opened though... they are really efficient at seating everyone quickly and getting the orders out. For smaller parties they do seat you in the same table with an empty seat in between. But yes, parties of 2 share a table. Ordering on Ubereats was nice! Everything tasted just as good and fresh! Came with the kimchi sides. The bibimbop was sealed in their special packaging. Portions are a little smaller I feel, but otherwise love that I can skip the long lines and big crowds. I mean eating there in the restaurant is nice.. but the area is really hard to find parking and sometimes the wait is way too long. Overall, I enjoyed my meal and I feel like Daeho offers good, authentic Korean food. Service is good! Price $$$ is up there... especially with the extra charges for extra cheese or taking your leftovers to-go (they vacuum seal your food for $1). But hey, treat yourself! The Daeho at the Hmart food court is usually less busy and everything is comparable to their main location.,Daeho my love!!!!!!!! This place is a realllll gem. When I moved to norcal last year, my sister tried to bring me to the Milpitas location THREE times - the first two times we could not get a seat even though we got there right at its opening but the third time, we finally got a seat after 2 hours of waiting. I'm really thankful that this SF location has a waitlist that you can join from anywhere - it doesn't need to be within a certain radius from the restaurant. However, yelp told me that my table was ready but when we got there, we needed to wait an extra 30 minutes. Just a precaution that the waitlist and wait times may not be super accurate.I definitely recommend coming here on a weekday over a weekend for a better wait time. If you do end up finding yourself stuck waiting for a couple of hours though, fear not, because the area is filled with other places to go to and explore! Japantown is very fun :) There's lots of cute dessert places and even an amc!! Perfect place to kill time.Although we got a table later than expected, the worker took our order early so that we could receive the food right when we're seated. He forgot to write down the yachae stone pot but it's okay because it came out relatively fast.Upon entering, you will notice the lively atmosphere of all parties laughing, drinking, enjoying themselves and their company. There were many families, couples, groups of friends here. It's a very warm environment to be gathered around the table together. I think I prefer the ambiance a little more than the Milpitas location since it feels like each party has its own table rather than being squished with others.My friends and I came here after our 3 hr lab so naturally we were STARVING. We gulfed down the ban chan dishes: radish, kimchi, and green onions. The servers constantly refilled them for us without us even needing to ask! They were very sweet.Of course we got the famous kalbijjim and added the necessary rice cake and cheese toppings. It ain't kalbijjim without these toppings trust me! Make sure to mix the cheese in quickly before it hardens. When the servers come out with the blow torch, get your cameras ready!!!Even though we had a party of five, the regular size that they recommend for 2-3 people was sufficient for us. The dish was packed with prime beef ribs that each person could eat at least 4 of them. We got lvl 1 mild spiciness and it was very manageable.My favorite vegetable in the kalbijjim is the carrot because it is marinated in sauce. The sauce is pretty sweet but it makes the entire dish very cohesive and the flavors blend nicely together. I have tried several kalbijjims from various locations (even LA) but Daeho's is the BEST HANDS DOWN. Yes it is expensive but if you split it with a big group it is not bad at all.One of my friends is vegetarian so we got the yachae stone pot. It was alright... I've definitely had better and half of the rice was burnt so it stuck on the bottom. I've tried some of the soups in the past and they were alright too. Nothing too special.If you are planning on taking food back home, they have take out boxes but there is a $1 packaging fee. Upon receiving the check my group was a little surprised about this so just a heads up!I think everyone should experience Daeho at least once in their life... it is such comfort food that will last for a while (literally though, I think I'm still digesting the food even after going there two days ago) :3,This location is quite crowded due to it being in Japantown. Parking is horrendous here. You can either park on the street or in the garage nearby.We tried to get on the Yelp waitlist for the night but it was closed via the app. We had to join the waitlist in person at the store. Our wait on a weekday at 5:30 PM was 45mins -1hour.The location is quite crowded. There are long tables and you are seat amongst other parties sharing a table.The servers themselves were 50/50 happy. Some were just quite not thrilled to be working while others were helpful and happy to help.We ordered the braised beef of course and it came out quick. The beef is alway so tender here and falls right off the bone. My fave is always the rice cakes simmering in the sauce. The side dishes here were also good. Although the kimchi could have been a bit more spicy.I do enjoy their braised ribs but the wait is just crazy sometimes. There are a ton of other locations around the bay that you can visit also! I love the Milpitas location!,I literally have been trying to come here several times during the year, and every time (especially nighttime) there is a long line. I remember one time the person told me the wait time was 2 hours. Today, we came right when they open and got in as one of the first parties. We ordered the combination beef soup and purple rice. The soup is amazing. The milky color with tight amount of salt and pepper. The beef wasn't a lot as I anticipated, but still were enough for two people. The place here is very Korean. You can just tell from the heavy utensils they use. I will for sure come back for the chest ribs. They look hella good.,First time here! The wait time was definitely over the top with it being 1.5 hours on a Saturday night! My friends and I walked around Japantown till we got seated. We ordered Braised Beef Mild Spice with extra meat + cheese. And also a side of purple rice. The Braised Beef itself was definitely sweet like for those who's tried Filipino Adobo. Note, there were also Bones for those who love it! Everything else inside like carrots, onions, rice cakes and possibly radish were immaculate! Digging into the stone top was very satisfying after the waiter melted the cheese using the torch! Definitely worth the +$5 & extra calories. The rice came out first along with the sides as per usual! Would definitely recommend the same order as it is one of the more popular ones on the menu!!,My partner and I have been meaning to try Daeho for a while and finally decided to go this week after a recent trip to South Korea. Honestly, it lives up to the hype! My partner and I both ordered Bibimbap (I got the Yachae that includes vegetables, egg, and rice) and thought it was delicious. Though there wasn't as much egg as I was expecting, I thought that the generous portion size and the quantity of rice and vegetables made up for it. I was very full by the end of the meal!The other thing I like about Daeho (and Korean dining in general) is that it is very much choose your own adventure in terms of spiciness. The Bibimbap itself is not spicy, and you are given sauce that you can use as much or as little as you want to add spiciness to your dish. Daeho also had some delicious sides included for you to eat with your meal, including kimchi.I won't say too much about the line here, because it's already mentioned. However, I will say a reminder to get on the Yelp waitlist before you go! We visited on a Tuesday and there was still a 45 minute wait on Yelp, so it saved us a lot of time to sign up for the list in advance.The last thing I want to mention is about dietary restrictions. As a vegetarian, I hesitated to visit Daeho for a while because I didn't think I could eat anything there. The Yachae stone pot is the vegetarian option, and I think it is still worth visiting for! That being said, a lot of the experience of Korean dining seems to be more meat-focused and also many of the dishes they serve are family style and consist of multiple portions. This is challenging for my partner and I since they eat meat and I do not. Basically, if not eating the family style, main attraction dishes is a deal breaker for you, I'd recommend bringing friends to share them with. If not, go for the Bibimbap!,I have been craving galbi jjim since the one time I had it at Sun Nong Dan in socal. Daeho is the ultimate comfort food to satisfy that craving. Very worth the wait, a much shorter wait if you come during the weekdays. If you're wondering how much your group should order, my party of 7 ordered a small and a large We still had some leftover at the end. We got it with cheese, rice cake, veggies, and glass noodles. Meat was falling off the bone! We were a bit surprised that they were charging $5-6 extra for the rice cakes. They accidentally left it out in one of our dishes and brought it out on the side and if you're curious on how much you're getting, let the photo speak for itself...Make sure you double check your bill before handing over your card! The hand held terminal showed a different total than the paper bill, which was fixed immediately.,I was a bit worried taking my friend here on a Thursday night at 7:30 PM because that's prime dinner time.  Especially since the waitlist said that it was completely closed off and when I got to the restaurant to add myself to the waitlist on the tablet, it said 3+ hours and had dozens of people already on the waitlist.  But the host asked me for how many people and what we wanted to order for the kalbijim to pre-order before sitting, and when we finished, I asked how long the wait was. He said 5 MINUTES.  5 minutes?!?!  I was shocked that it was going to be so quick, and had fully expected to wait at least a half hour, but sure enough we were sat within 5 minutes and kalbijim (adding the cheese is a must btw, highly recommended) came out within 10-15 minutes.  It's been awhile since I've been here (first time was when this place first opened and the wait was 3 HOURS which is honestly insanely long to wait for any place regardless of how good it is).  But given the swift service and excellent food, solid 5 stars for me.  They serve kimchi, chives, and radish as their banchan, and my favorite is the chives!  We had hoped to tried their seolleong tang but they were sold out by then, so if you're hoping to try some of their soup options, I'd try to go a bit earlier than prime dinner time.,Came in tonight to have dinner.  The place is  a bit too noisy to have a good conversation.  It was completely packed inside, but my party was able to lock in a seat.  We ordered the Kalbijjim the Braised Beef Rib bowl  which feeds about 4 people.  The Beef rib was spicy, soft and juicy while the vegetables, carrots, Korean radish and onions made this dish very enjoyable by completing the textures.Service was great, quick and responsive, however the loud music prevented our server from properly understanding us, so they need to lower the volume a bit. Otherwise this place is worth coming back.  I will try something different next time.,I love this restaurant to death. It's very indulgent and definitely doesn't try to be something that it isn't. You come here once in a while with a group of friends as a treat, being a frequent flyer would be pretty difficult to stomach (literally). I also love t",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at the service and the food quality is the same throughout every Daeho, there's no discrepancies. Last time I came here we ordered the large kalbijjim for 6 people with all the toppings (vegetables, glass noodles, rice cakes, and cheese) and we still had difficulty finishing it (LOL), along with the galbitang (not pictured). My friend's Korean roommate mentioned that she even thinks wistfully upon it sometimes... it's very original while also not being entirely indistinguishable from a bona fide Korean restaurant with its soups!,"Granted the price point to this place is a little high but the portions are large enough to share between 4 people! And this place never disappoints. Kalbijjim is Korean for braised short ribs and was historically served for """"kings and royal families."""" We always order the Doh Gal Jjim which is the braised beef ribs", with ox cartilage and tendon. We've tried it both with cheese and without and we personally like it better without the cheese because it just feels less heavy. There's really nothing more to say about this place except for the fact that you get what you pay for - a really delicious meal. They also serve alcohol here if you are in the mood and also offer a Squid Kalbijjim which comes with squid.,Yes!!! Definitely go! Order the Kalbijjim(Braised short ribs) so good!! Will go back!,Came here on a Wednesday and it was super packed. We came with a party of 6 and waited around 45 mins. Finally got seated around an hour before they close.Of course we ordered the beef short rib with cheese on top. It was pretty expensive but I would say it's pretty worth if you come with 6 people. We also ordered the beef bone soup and that exceeded expectations, especially on a cold day. The soup was not too salty but was really flavorful. Didn't like the fact that they charge for takeout containers though, considering the price isn't cheap. Would come hear again with a big group so it's more worth,Ordered kalbijjim with extra meat and cheese and cha dol seollongtang with extra meat for take out. Even for a take out it was so good! (I called in to make my order for pick up and did NOT order online through any apps - I would recommend calling in as NONE of the apps allow the extra meat option which Is a much better deal, plus all apps charge $81 for a kalbijjim while if you call in to order with extra meat is just $85). There was enough food for 8 adults with the two entrees ordered split for two days. The soup congeal overnight and would dissolve the moment you add some hot water to reboil. That's definitely quality soup right there. So good when you boil it and have it immediately. The side dishes given in to-go containers were sufficient and good as well. Definitely don't mind ordering to-go again next time.,Daeho is bomb. I would drive to the city again & again just to have their kalbijjim soup. I really wish the wait isn't so damn long, but you're in Japantown with lots to see so just suck it up. We tried to get there as soon as it opened and even then it was a 90 minute wait (Yelp timer was actually pretty accurate). They are pretty efficient though; they'll take your order when you're one of the next few in line so when you're finally seated you don't have to wait long for your food. Do yourself a favor and add all the extra toppings. It's so freakin' good!!,Get in the waitlist, explore Japan town, got text message, come back to order the signature dish Kalbijjim with all sides and purple rice, got seated. Then wait. Crowded, very noisy as expected in Korean popular restaurants. See the cooking show at the table when the main dish came. Voila. Enjoy,4.5 starsAfter a wait of about 1-1.5 hours my bf and I finally got seated! We were super excited to try this place out. I really wanted to try the oxtail but they sold out already, so we got the regular Kalbi Jjim. We got ours medium spicy and it was perfect. The regular portion is more than enough for 2 people, 3 people would be perfect! We added cheese and vegetables for our toppings. Loved seeing the waiter blow torch the cheese on top!  Delicious meal and I'd say... worth the wait. I do think the price is a little high though at $75 for the regular size but I would still come back!,Food: 3.5/5Service: 4/5Ambiance: 3.5/5Overall: A wee bit expensive and a long wait for what it is.Would I come back: Maybe if I was being treated out to the place.The extended review...Food: Kalbi Jim with Extra Meat - 3.5/5 - So I'd say the taste itself is a 5 but the pricing is definitely a 2.  The food itself is very tasty and rich.  But between two people, I've paid less for a lot more portion size.  Usually I'm able to get something for half the price and take some home but here the whole thing was finished.  Good quality, but I wouldn't wait or pay so much for this.Service: 4/5 - Friendly service.Ambiance: 3/5 - It's a bit cramped and packed!,My friends and I, a party of 5 came here for lunch on a Friday. We got seated right away. The place was cute but smelled a little bit like a subway station. We ordered the Kkogal Jjim, Chadol Suyuk, and Kalbi Bibimbab.Kkogal jjim--We ordered it medium spicy with glass noodles. Fall off the bone. Super flavorful. It had tteobokki and potatoes. If you are going to pick one thing on the menu, this is it.Chadol Suyuk--Bone broth with lots of chives and thin slices of brisket. If you like Seoullongtang than you should order this. Perfect when the weather cools down. Healthy and light.Kalbi Bibimbab--Standard bibimbab. Came out sizzling and you mix in the sauce yourself. This can feed 6 people, probably the biggest stone pot rice I've seen.This was lots of food for 5 people. I think we can feed like 2 more people. We had some leftovers. I would definitely come here again.,Visited Daeho on a Thursday night around 8pm for a party of 6. We walked in and had about a 10 min wait before we were sat. Prior to be seated, we placed our order at the counter at the front. * kalbi jjim* kko gal jjimI've actually ordered Daeho multiple times for delivery, especially during the pandemic, but it was my first time actually dining in he restaurant. Service was quick as our food came out and seeing the actual torching of the cheese is definitely a cool experience and something you can't get from to go. While my friends ate the kalbi jjim, I went in on the kko gal jjim which consists of ox tail. The meat was so tender and fell right off the bone. The dish itself was savory, lightly sweet, and loaded with other ingredients like carrots, potatoes, and rice cakes to make for an incredible hearty meal. Daeho is definitely a must if you're looking for a comforting and filling meal that's perfect and fun to enjoy with family/friends,Overpriced and not worth the hype.,I've brought 3 different groups of people here. Personally I think Daeho is in its own category -- the food is special and hard to find elsewhere. I personally enjoy adding all the toppings and sharing with 2-3 people. I think 3 people is the minimum to finish one of their braised short rib dishes with all the toppings. I also think the cheese adds to the photos but isn't worth getting otherwise (although I may be biased since I don't really care for cheese in the first place). It's a bit pricey but worth it! I always bring out of town friends here when they ask where we should go eat.,Decided to come here for dinner with a few friends on a Friday night. We put ourselves on the wait list prior to arriving and our tables were ready by the time we checked in. We got the braised short rib EX and added cheese and veggies, and the beef rib soup. The soup portion was rather small and it was barely enough for a medium bowl for me and my friends. The soup could also use more flavor, it tasted a bit bland. Their short rib is definitely one of the best in the Bay, the meat is super tender and soft. Even though the EX had extra meat, my friends and I felt like it was still a small portion. The food is good but the only reason this is getting 4 stars is mainly due to service. It was so hard to flag a waiter down and when we requested for extra napkins, utensils, and water, no one ever got back to us. My friend had to go up to the back where the waiters were to ask for them. It also seemed like they were rushing us to pay the bill and leave. I understand it is busy, but we weren't even there for an hour. One of the servers even attempted to snatch the card from my friend despite us wanting to double check the bill before paying.,Mouthwatering kalbijjim with torched cheese, flavorful rice cakes, and tender vegetables - I can't imagine it getting any better! The food is so flavorful, tasty, and comes with several levels of spiciness to accommodate anyone's level of tolerance. The kalbijjim comes with sides of various types of kimchi, which are also just amazing. I've gotten this in the restaurant with all of the extra toppings, as well as in the form of takeout - always so consistently delicious! You definitely can't go wrong with Daeho's famous hot steaming plate of kalbijjim - wait up to an hour or two in line, or check in on Yelp's waitlist ahead of time!It's worth the wait for your first experience, but getting takeout is always a fantastic choice too.,We were on waitlist and ordered and the guy in front told us that our table would be ready in 10-15 minutes but we waited for over 30 minutes before getting seated. It was during peak hours though and there were lots of parties there. However, while checking in for the waitlist, you are able to order your food so when your table is ready, the food is ready as well. We ordered the Kalbi Jim with extra meat added glass noodles and cheese for 4 people. I feel like we couldve done just regular with no extra meat because we were so full at the end. Definitely recommend pouring the rice in at the end to make it crispy and super flavorful! The meat was super tender and everything was so good with the cheese. The noodles were kind of thin. I wish it was thicker. The inside is a lot smaller than expected! It is really loud in here but overall a great dinner spot!,This is an absolute must-have; I couldn't (still can't) stop thinking about it, and I can't wait to go back! Here's what we ordered (and some tips for our/your next visit!):- Kalbi Jjim (braised beef ribs): The dish has a customizable spicy," and we ordered """"mild"""" with extra vegetables. I would definitely suggest mild for those that eat a little spicy on a day to day basis (but aren't looking to sweat and cry). The meat was incredibly soft", and there were a large variety of vegetables. Dotted with many rice cakes too. The menu does say this is good for 2-3 people. I would say it's a solid dish for 3 people -- fed two of us at the restaurant, and had enough for leftovers for the day after. This was a very unique dish; my only regret is not adding cheese (I'm lactose intolerant). I'll have to try it the next time... the torched cheese on our neighbor's dishes looked amazing.Tips:- Dinner rush starts at around ~6:30p, so definitely hop on the Yelp waitlist before! We hopped on the waitlist at 5:45p and arrived at 6p (on a Friday evening). We got seated almost immediately, but the restaurant was nearly full.- Know what you'll order before arriving: They'll ask for your order at the front, so that your food is ready sooner. We probably waited 15m for our dish.- Much like kbbq," the food will splatter and leave residue scent. Wear your best at your own risk! Many diners did dress quite nicely though.- The dish doesn't really need """"extra"""" of anything -- be it meat", vegetables," etc. For all of the """"jjims""""", I would suggest ordering the base dish first. It comes with 2 bowls of rice!Couldn't recommend more. If you're still waffling over what to eat for dinner... you can end your search here.,This place is FIREEEEE. I have not had this food combination before and it's amazing. The ribs are cooked to perfection where it's soft but not overly soft and falling apart. The flavors were great, not too spicy as we asked for mild, and the other ingredients like carrots and rice cakes were cooked to perfection. This dish is pricey but it's good for 2 to 4 people (good for 4 people with smaller appetites). They don't have this where I'm from so I'm still thinking about this meal!,My friends have been nonstop talking about Daeho for the past year, and I was finally able to go this weekend. Let me tell you all, it absolutely lived up to the hype. The restaurant is small and a little cramped, but it gives off a warm and welcoming vibe. When we got there, our party of 6 joined the waitlist at #47. Luckily, the line moves really fast, so we waited no more than 30 minutes to get seated. We spent that 30 minutes at the Daiso across the street!We ordered the spicy kalbi jjim with rice cakes, veggies, and cheese. When the food came out, it was already an impressive and delicious looking stew with lots of meat, veggies, and cheese. The waiter then pulled out a mini blowtorch and melted the cheese right in front of us. A++ for presentation!!The stew itself is absolutely delicious. I loveeee spicy food, and this had the perfect spice level! For those who dislike spice, I recommend the milder options. The stew is incredibly flavorful, and it helps to have a bowl of rice to dilute the intensity a little bit. The restaurant offers both purple and white rice, as well as a few sides. The stew comes in a large, family style portion, but everyone has individual plates to make eating easier. Two orders of kalbi jjim was plenty for my group of 6. Truly a 5 star dining experience!,I have been wanting to go here for years, but it is not the closest to home or work. Additionally, this is not the place to have one serving of galbijjim, or the shortest wait (helpful hint - join on yelp guestlist, as it is even busy at 5pm). After a group reunion, we all decided on this place as we have either walked past it previously and wanted to go in. So the round-down, the menu is on the wall when you enter. You order all the food, then you get escorted to your table. Drinks are ordered at the table. As the resident foodie of the group of 6, I was in charge of ordering:-Regular galbijjim, medium spice + add-on rice cakes (we wanted cheese but we had a few lactose intolerant people, sooo.....)-Regular Squid galbijjim, mild spice-Seolleong Tang ComboFor 6 people, with side dishes (chives with carrots, napa kimchi, and cubed radish kimchi) on the table and a beer and two soju bottles, it was packed but amazing. Both galbijjim were amazing but the group liked the medium spice more with rice cakes. Pay up front with the host and the total for everything was $300 (tip already included in larger groups), so it was an easy split.,We got to try their kalbijjim with rice cakes and cheese and it was so DELICIOUS!! When we got there the wait was around 50-70 minutes (you sign in on a waitlist on a tablet they have by the door) and we waited for around that long. It definitely is a longer wait but worth it! (Got there around 5:30) Additionally if you're able to get on the waitlist right at 5 on Yelp, it may be shorter.The kalbijjim was so cheesy good! The rice cakes were soft and chewy while the veggies were flavorful and had a nice bite. Lastly, the beef was so tender and delicious. They bring the entire pot over with cheese on top and actually torch and melt the cheese at the table in front of you. Everything about the post seems pretty customizable from what you want to include in the pot to the spice level which makes it super easy to adjust to your liking! The portions were also pretty big! Especially since it comes with rice. We shared it amongst 2 people but it would be enough for 3 as well. Definitely worth the try!!,Daeho is a must try place in SF! You absolutely have to try the Kalbi Jjim with cheese and rice cakes!!The meat was tender and fell off the bone. The sauce was seasoned to perfection. On top of that, the cheese was to die for! My husband and I ordered the regular size (serves 2-3 people), and we had a lot of leftovers left. Portion sizes here are huge! A few things to note: 1) It is on the pricer side ($75 for the regular and toppings are additional cost). 2) The restaurant can be a bit loud.We came on a Thursday night at 5:30pm and were seated right away! When we left, it looked like there were more people waiting in line to get seated.Overall, I would definitely recommend this place!,Super impressed by how efficient this place was! I was worried about the wait time after talking to some friends but I actually didn't have to wait at all for Sat lunchtime at 1230! Put my name down on the waitlist via Yelp 15 minutes prior, was called to place our order while our table was being prepared, and upon being seated, the banchan and rice was quickly served. The Kalbijjim was incredible and exceeded my expectations! The cheese made it even more yummy and fun to pull! The quantity of food was overwhelming for two people so I suggest coming with 4 or preparing enough fridge space!,Food is absolutely amazing! The short rib is cooked to perfection, make sure to add cheese as it makes it even better! The soup is also a classic, delicious broth Service is too slow and can be improved, lines are too long and servers can be a little rudeAmbiance is nice for young crowd but can be too loud/rowdy,I go to Daeho at least once a quarter because I personally think it's one of the only decent restaurants for Korean food in San Francisco (the entire menu is definitely overpriced, but it's SF so it's not at all surprising). My friends and I (usually a party of 4-5) always order the kalbijjim with extra meat, level 2 spicy, and all toppings. That dish alone leaves us all quite stuffed by the end of our meal. I recently also started ordering the suyuk beef bone soup, which includes your choice of beef cut and chives, because the broth can be refilled upon request and it's a nice palette cleanser to all the spicy dishes.,I actually checked in on Yelp before arriving  and only waited about 40 mins to get a table.Sadly after dinner, found out our car got broken into . Made out experience kinda worse, but it's ok.The kalbi Jim was good, but wish there was more meat and flavor for the price we were paying for it. The other stew was a nice to balance the heaviness of everything.,My fellow asians: bring your lactose pills and prepare yourselves for cheesy goodness!!! Daeho is known for their kalbijjim (braised beef short ribs) that are totally worth the hype. I've had my fair share of kalbijjim in Korea and have to say the flavor here is legit, but the meat is not quite as tender (some parts are hard to chew). There are 4 different spicy levels, so your weak friends can enjoy the deliciousness too. I'd recommend medium or spicy though! The additional $5 for cheese is an absolute must, and the servers even come with a small blowtorch to melt the cheese in front of you. Dinner AND a show. My one caveat with this place is that I feel like the prices are too high. I guess they can charge $80 for one order of kalbijjim since the Daeho name is quite well known in the area and has a good reputation. I've shown photos of the food to friends and asked them to guess the price, and most say around the $30-50 range. The regular size is recommended for 2-3 people, but I would say it skews more toward the 3 people unless you've got some big eaters.Make sure you get on the Yelp waitlist, since this place is always absolutely popping. Disregard the estimated wait times though, as it moves wayyy faster than what it tells you.,This place has a long wait and totally worth it. Make sure to join the waitlist on Yelp to skip the line while heading over there. for me there were 12 people ahead but quickly moved down to 7 and i visited the host and still was able to be seated! The food is ridiculously good. i got the level 3 spice on the specialty beef rip soup and added the cheese. we all couldn't finish it and took it to go. price was like $75 and can be shared with 2-3 ppl. so flavorful and super spicy not for the faint of heart. totally worth it and the staff is so friendly. i will come back here always whenever i am near10/10 this is why we go to SF,Ordered the Kalbijjim via bentocart. I added the rice cake and cheese and it came with kimchi and purple rice.  The portions were hefty!  I put it into a Dutch oven to reheat it.  It was warm and bubbling. The beef is tender.  The carrots and potatoes were satisfying. Very satisfying stew-like experience.  I ordered mild and that was plenty spicy for me.  Pricey but satisfying so would order again!,I'm not sure what will do justice. Look at the picture? The meat was so tender. Can't wait to go back! The service was quick. We waited an hour but it was worth it.,Wow!!! Expensive but so worth it for a special treat! hehehe! It's delicious and I would recommend getting it with extra rice cakes for more carbs. The meat and vegetables go so well together but the main course is rlly heavy so make sure to get rice on the side too.Wonderful experience! Make sure you can eat a lot or be willing to take a lot home.,You know that feeling when you eat a great meal and feel comfort, joy and at home at the same time?Daeho is it. Great service, even better food. Love this place!,The HIGHLIGHT of my trip to SF. We got there early (4:45 pm) because we heard the line gets long quickly, and we were seated right away. We got the traditional kalbijjim with cheese and it was SO GOOD. There are also other optional items you can add, but the portion size is huge so honestly, cheese was enough for us. I'd say that the regular size would be good for a group of 3 - we were a group of 2 and had some leftover. We also had the sullangtang but I'd say that it was less impressive (especially if you have had LA sullangtang before). Definitely recommend stopping by here for the kalbijim though - it was the best!!,The best Korean dish and meal I've ever had. I can't find this kind of Korean in Seattle. The rice and simple starters were good. It's a show when they bring the entree and the torch out. The cheese melts perfectly on to the perfectly well balanced sauce mixed together with tender meat... it's heavenly. I can't express how much I would love an expansion of this restaurant in Seattle. Every time I come to SF, I come here now!,Let me start by saying i continued to eat my leftovers from this place for the following 3 days after the meal, so you know it was good! The 4 stars is because of the way they have their ambiance/service and the way the waitlist is structured.They open at 5 and we arrived at 445 to a long line outside  you can't put your name in online, there is an iPad they put out at 5 that allows you to join the waitlist then we had about an hour for a party of 2. We attempted to go to 2 other top rated ramen spots nearby but had the same situation so we ended up just waiting the entire time. They text and tell you you have 5 min to make it to the host so we ran over, but they told us that it was to allow you to pre-order your meal if you want one of the star dishes. Which we did, the Kko Gal Jjim (braised beef rib with oxtail) - and we added rice cakes, cheese, and veggies. We got sat about 15 min later. It was cold throughout the restaurant because they never close the front door, some tables have the Korean bbq grill in center, ours didn't. They brought out 3 diff kimchi covered veggies to start which was yummy, the green onions were the best.  When they brought the dish out they torch the cheese on top in front of you which is so visually satisfying and ends up being as delicious as it looks. We ordered medium spicy and it was just that. Everything inside is cooked to perfection and the meat is portioned generously not skimping out like some places. definitely recommend all these toppings especially the rice cakes, and we loved the purple rice. So much food leftover. Too full to try dessert Other reason for 4 stars is because since the line is long they really try to rush you out. The moment i put my fork down (so full, ready to pop) they asked us if they can get us anything else & brought the check, clearly wanting the table.,Our party of five worked together to polish off the Kalbijjim and Seafood bibimbap - these generous portions are not for the faint of heart! The spicy braised short ribs caramelize onto the stone pot, alongside the cheese and rice cake add-ons. It is really an excellent meal that is worth the wait and swarms of people waiting outside.The crispy rice on the bottom of the bibimbap was so delectable. I love that this dish had a 2:1 ratio of fillings to rice. The sweet gochujang sauce and generous servings of vegetables made for the perfect bibimbap. The only con was that I wish both dishes had more protein - there was not nearly enough seafood or braised beef in either dish. I think the most rave review came from my friends, who kept eating while sweating profusely, because while it was spicy (we got mild) it was too good to stop eating!,Fiyah! The beef stew was worth the 1+ hour wait. We grabbed a drink at a hotel across the street to kill the time. The meat was very tender and the cheese melted was a great touch. The soup was also a nice compliment. This fed a table of 4 and we all were put in a food coma afterwards. Will be coming again.. deff worth the hype,Super busy spot. Get on the waitlist ahead of time or you're looking at 1-2 hr wait time. Been here several times now and it's always been consistent. The kalbijjim seems to be the fave for most folks. Tasty but sometimes I don't want cheese. One thing I never get tired of is their soups. Kalbi tang all day thanks. Also their hot stone bibimbab never let's me down. Hit it with that spicy sauce and you're in flavor town,So good! I can see why its so popular. Pro tip: Add yourself to the yelp waitlist right when it opens at 5pm (waitlist isn't available before then). And then wait at home for an hour and head on over. You can also pre order your food because the kalbijjim takes about an hour to cook. Not sure what to order? Definitely get the Kalbijjim with rice cake and cheese. We also ordered Royal brisket bone soup which was good but the star of show was definitely the kalbijjim. That alone was enough food for 4 people. Don't forget to add salt and pepper to your taste for the soup.,Saw all the reviews of this place on Yelp and I knew I had to come! Some of the softest meat I've ever had before. The kalbijim is so so good and the cheese on top just adds to the flavor. The sauce of the kalbijim isn't too spicy, and it's manageable to eat it with the cheese. The bone broth soup was okay, it lacked a little bit of flavor, but I can see how its clean taste is supposed to help when eating something as heavy and rich as the kalbijim, but personally, I could've done without it. The kalbijim, however, is definitely a must. The wait was really long though. I came with a party of 10 on a Saturday night. Joined the waitlist around 5:30pm, got the text to go to the restaurant at 7pm and ordered the kalbijim ahead of time at the front, and then was seated around 7:45pm. I can say the wait was worth it for the kalbijim, but I wish I had eaten something before since I didn't think the wait would be that long. The two kalbijim plus all the side dishes were more than enough for the 10 of us and after splitting, it was around $30 per person! I'd say overall this was a really enjoyable experience, I just didn't enjoy the wait since it was really cold outside and we waited almost 45 minutes after when they told us we'd be seated soon. However, one plus is that the food did come immediately after sitting down, so the wait outside is basically the wait we would have inside at another restaurant.,As a Korean, Kalbijjim is a part of my soul and while I was skeptical about Daeho's extra cheesy variant of Kalbijjim, I'm super happy to admit that it's really good! The restaurant itself is in a super convenient spot st the center of Japan town and if you're lucky enough to dodge past the huge line outside its door, you'll be blessed with the super savory kalbijjim that Daeho has become known for. The Kalbijjim is covered in cheese and can come with a variety of optional toppings (I'd recommend everything), and not only is it absolutely delicious with super tender meat, it's a huge serving! The standard pot can easily fill four to five people and serves as an excellent, communal party food!If you have a craving for kalbijjim like I often do, than you better be ready to line up at Daeho, since half of SF will be waiting too!,I can't even count the number of times I've eaten at Daeho - the braised short rib (Kalbijim) is so flavorful and tender. Every time I come here, I always get the extra meat option and add all the toppings - glass noodles, rice cake, veggies and cheese. Next time I come, I want to try the Squid Kalbijim! My one tip is to get the Kalbi Tang (Beef Rib Soup). It's a clear soup, but has so much flavor and helps cut through the heaviness of the Kalbijim. Sometimes, I take the noodles from the soup and add them into the Kalbijim. I highly recommend this restaurant for either take out or dine in. When you do take out/ delivery, they vacuum seal the packaging so it never leaks (super smart)!,This place is worth the hype tldr! If you plan it well you won't have to wait ridiculously long. Hop on the waitlist when it opens at 5pm. For a party of 6 we were able to be seated by 6:30pm. We arrived 15 min before our time to check in.This place is known for their braised short rib. It takes an hour to prepare so order while you're waiting! Get it with the cheese and it's super good! It's warm and rich in flavor. The dish is sweet and savory and very comfort food like.We also tried the oxtail broth with veggies. This was underwhelming and bland for me, but others may like it. This place is very busy and a little hard to get their attention but food is solid.,The braised short rib was incredible! We also added the glass noodles, rice cakes, and cheese. The small size is certainly enough to feed 3-4 peop,I will never stop coming back to Daeho. Daeho is a go-to stop for me and my friends. The wait can be long, especially for big groups, but it's definitely worth it. 2 kalbijjim's can thoroughly feed 5-6 people. Although it can get a little pricey in the end, the experience and the food is definitely worth it. You can add toppings such as veggies, noodles, rice cakes, and more. When they bring the food out, they use a blowtorch to melt the cheese, making it a fun visual experience, while also heating up the dish. Everything about the food is amazing and I will not stop coming back!,After having been to Daeho multiple times for kalbitang, we finally rallied a group to try the kalbijim. And my god, it is exactly what everyone raved out. We ordered one each of the spicy and non spicy, and added glass noodles, veggies and cheese. Every bite was tender, melt-in-your-mouth beef, with the spice of the gochujang balanced by the creamy cheese. The veggies we added also helped to balance the heaviness that came with that much meat, and we definitely appreciated having the sides to do the same as well. Portions are incredibly generous - we were a group of six and we still had decent sized take-homes (which I definitely ate for lunch the next day and it was still amazing). Also big shoutout to our servers for being so patient with everyone taking videos of them melting the cheese! Spicy over non spicy in my opinion, but you really can't go wrong with either one. I'm already craving it again writing this - definitely going back soon!,WOWWWW I've tried a similar place in LA but daeho did it the best!! So much flavor in every piece of meat and veggie, we got rice cakes and cheese added on and it was amazing. I will dream of eating here again until next time,If you're a soup and cheese lover, then you'll be just as excited to try this place as I was! We tried the two most popular items:1) Kalbijjim: We love adding cheese and rice cakes to to it!They torch the cheese so it's all melty.2) Suyuk: A contrast in flavor and simplicity compared to the kalbijjim! The soup is clean and the chives make you feel not so bad.,If you've been to Sun Nong Dang in Koreatown, LA, Daehos braised short ribs with extra cheese does not fall short. The marination is a little more on the sweeter side at Daeho, but it's still packed with flavor. The short ribs will dissolve in your mouth, the soft and chewy rice cakes are fun changes in texture, and with the veggies compliment the dish flawlessly. You won't be disappointed. It is a bit pricey, but if you're splitting amongst 4-5 people, it's totally worth it. The braised short rib with cheese is enough to feed 2-3 people but you can upsize it to feed 3-4. Grab a soup dish as well (we got the combination suyuk, but any bone both soup will do well to balance out the heaviness of the short ribs).,Korean food has now taken the #1 spot for my top asian foods. I was never really a fan of the whole KBBQ kind of thing but having tried 2 Korean spots that aren't KBBQ, I will say Korean food is a hit for me. Going through Yelp and seeing this place come up as a popular/nearby spot, we thought we'd give it a try. We got there 20 minutes before opening (4pm) and we were second in line. We were greeted 10 minutes before opening and they had already took our order. Smart thing to do since this place can pack up easily.We ended up ordering the Daeho Suyuk Modeum #9. The weather was perfect for some soup and I'm glad we went with that option. It had a mixture of tender meat and the soup was light. Wasn't overpowered with flavor and heavy oil. They have salt & pepper on the side and adding some salt to the dish made it even that much better (not that it needed it). We had a choice of 2 different sides. White or purple rice. We went with purple rice. Even though there hardly a difference in the taste," we went with the purple rice because it's definitely more """"photo worthy"""". Also", my kids ate so much. I don't think I've ever seen them eat that much while out at a restaurant. The service itself is 5 stars. We had multiple waiters/waitresses check on us to see how things were, added more soup to our pot and constantly refilled our water. Overall, this restaurant is definitely worth a try. As I said, Korean food went from #4 to #1 so come throughhhhhh!!!!,One of my favorite Korean restaurants in SF. There's always a wait, so if you don't want to wait try to come right when it opens OR add yourself to the yelp waitlist before heading to the restaurant. I usually get the galbijjim, spice level 1 or 2. That's already spicy enough for me. Sometimes I add cheese, extra noodles, and/or rice cakes. It's great place to eat with a group of friends. Parking can be tough since it's in Japantown, either you can find street or garage parking. Highly recommend this place.,Ok- a few things...1. If you want to get a seat here, it is *so busy* so join the online waitlist on yelp at least an hour ahead of time. Try to res if you can. When you get in, they'll ask you what you want for your kalbijjim, so look at the menu while you wait.2. It's hella loud here. Perfect for a party- I'm definitely bringing my girls after a night out, or having a birthday get together here- but I brought my partner here for a date, and our introverted asses weren't having it Lol. Probably not good for an intimate date night, def not first date unless you both have loud ass voices, but definitely bring the crew here!3. The food is SOOOO delicious - we got the kalbijjim with cheese & rice cakes added. First time my partner and I had kalbijjim, and the whole time we were eating," my partner and I kept going """"we are overwhelmed."""" It is gigantic", the meat is so tender, potatos/carrots in the gojuchang sauce have this perfect sweetness. Def will come again.4. Kalbijjim will be around ~$70-80 so prepare for that if you come with a small party. Again, come here with a big party.,4.5 stars!We were craving korean food and needed somewhere that opened early before we headed north to napa. Luckily, Daeho is open at 11am and we were one of the first customers in. It's located right across from the main japan town center.It looks like they are known for their kalbijjim, but it was only 2 of us and we definitely could not finish that giant dish on our own and on a time constraint. BUT one day we hope to come back with friends to try it!!We each got a soup, rice cake beef soup and spicy beef soup. and omg, it was so comforting and warm and delicious!! It comes with super tender pieces of beef, egg, and flat glass noodles. You also get a bowl of rice, but my soup was already carb heavy with the noodles and dduk. My bf's spicy soup tasted more like yukgaejang broth and it was also delicious! Just wish we had more time to enjoy and finish it,The galbi jjim is so soft and tender. Must get medium spicy with all the add ons. Service is great and very attentive. Beware of getting seated at the same table with strangers. It is a little uncomfortable at first but once your food arrives you'll get lost in the deliciousness of it all.,This place is so amazing!! I'm from LA and every time I go to SF I have to go to daeho. You definitely have to get there early or check in on yelp before you get there. Make sure to get extra beef, rice cakes, and add cheese!,Daeho's kalbijjim is the standout. The signature dish is made of sweet-spicy, slow-braised, tender beef short rib stew, which comes sizzling on a cast-iron pan and topped with shredded mozzarella that's flame-torched upon arrival. Mainly docking a star because there seemed to be a greater serving of vegetables even though we ordered extra meat. The seolleongtang, or ox bone soup, and short rib bibimbap were also fantastic. The seolleongtang broth was so refreshing compared to the heavier plates. And be sure to scrape off the crispy rice off the stone bowl for bibimbap.The restaurant is extremely popular, and ergo very busy. There are no reservations besides Yelp Waitlist, so it would be best to arrive near opening time to snag a table.,Check in at 6pm, and the app shows that we need to wait 2-2.5hrs. It's really a long line! However my friend want to try, so we just hangout in Japan town until we got seated at 7:30. We ordered the regular kalbi jjim and Cho doi. At first we want to try kko ri, but ox tail was sold out. Actually I was so excited for the food and I was so hungry after waiting an hour and a half. The food came fast and kalbi jjim is flavorful! We ordered mild and it just prefect. I can't stop myself to keep eating as it so delicious. The kko ri tasted fresh after the heavy favor kalbi jjim. The beef is so soft, and I don't even need any additional pepper or salt for the soup, it already tasted so good. The point to make it 4 stars is the restaurant is crowded. Our table was sharing with another two groups of people. The one seated next to me was a stranger, and the distance between us look like we're very close friend. Also it's so loud at the restaurant, sometimes can't hear what my friend was talking. Overall, I love the food and definitely will come back, but next time I will join on the waitlist on yelp before I get there.,It's fun to come here with a large group since it's expensive and too big of a portion for one. There are already a lot of reviews for Daeho, but an insight I realized is to try the kalbijjim at different spice level. When I came here for the first time, my group ordered spicy level 2. It was too spicy for me so I didn't enjoy it as much, even though I really enjoyed Jina Bakes' kalbijjim croissant which is made at level 2. The most recent time I came, my group ordered non-spicy which is a completely different taste. I was able to taste the meat flavor better, and even put the sauce over the rice! So I guess I should try spice level 1 someday, but too bad they don't sell individual size.,The reviews speak for itself. But to add on to the amazing reviews, here I go. The service is good. Nothing too spectacular but considering they were super packed and stressed," I wasn't upset. They were attentive to our needs and were kind. They don't really have time to mingle with customers but wasn't expecting so. Great service for how busy and stressed they were. We waiting around 4:10PM and we're 3rd in line on a Sunday. The line got quite long so be aware that it gets packed. They don't take reservations and their waitlist starts at 5:30. The food was absolutely amazing!!!! The prices look expensive but it wasn't too bad. The Kalbi Jim is HUGE. We did get the large with extra meat but were all full by the end of it. The meat is so tender and everything was bursting with flavor. Absolutely amazing. We didn't get cheese but people around us did and it looked great! The Beef Royal Brisket soup was also super yummy!! Lots of meat and rice noodles perfectly cooked. We definitely didn't need it since we were all full BUT was a great way to end the dinner since it's a """"lighter"""" dish than the Kalbi Jim. 100% recommend!!!!!!!",Daeho is highly reviewed on Yelp and by my Korean friends alike, and for good reason!Daeho is THE spot in SF to sit down if you're looking for warm Korean food. The beef soup is unlike anything else you can get anywhere. How Daeho works is you order a stone pot of Beef Soup, choosing the meat and add-ons, as well as a spice level (which, for you spice lovers, the spicy options are actually very spicy here). Some add-ons I would always recommend are cheese and rice cakes. These stone pots are also very large, and can easily feed a party of 3-4 people. Other than the main course of the beef soup, you just order rice (they have purple rice as well as white rice!) and unlimited sides (Kimchi, radish, etc.) are included. The wait is often quite long, but that's a good sign really, just make sure to come early or reserve ahead of time!,We timed it right by joining the Yelp waitlist and arriving  right on time. After we checked in, the hostess asked us what we wanted to order before being seated. We ordered the beef rib with ox knee. We were one of the few tables that didn't add cheese. It was a lot of food for the two of us. I wish they offered a smaller size. The beef rib was tender and fell off the bone. I was thinking the ox knee would have the texture of tendon, which is what I wanted. I'm not sure if there was any ox knee on the plate though, as I didn't see it or maybe I wasn't able to identify it. The plate also had potatoes, carrot, daikon, and rice cake. While we thought the food was good, it was also quite expensive. I would rather go to a a Korean restaurant where I can try more dishes rather then limit myself to one big plate. Service was minimal unless you called for them. We asked for boxes to take the rest of our food home. They give you a box and then seal it for you. We thought that was pretty cool, but there is a $1 packaging fee.,I was taken here and it was super good. You're able to season w/ salt and pepper to your taste which was great. The food came out pretty quickly as well. Before the soup came out, we had some different kimchis and they were all good.,It really does live up to the hype. I got the dish with the tendon and of course the classic soup. Didn't have to wait too long because we got there early (tip). YOU HAVE TO GET THE RICE CAKES. It literally absorbed alllll the flavor of the sauce and the chewiness was perfect. If you're a fan of tendon, somehow they even make that so flavorful. I can't even describe the flavor it's a lot more umami and meaty tasting than the usual gochujang types of dishes. You just have to come experience it yourself.,We came here for dinner and checked in beforehand but let me say the wait time is not accurate! It seems like they do not mark off the people they sit down, so on Yelp, the wait time was 200 minutes but in fact, it was really just like a 30 min wait for us! (Although we arrived too late and had to wait additional 30min)They did run out of the ox tail with short ribs when we came here so we just ordered the short rib! It was sooo flavorful and delicious! Although I wanted the meat to be super soft like the ox tail but it was still good! Please order the cheese! It is a must as they will torch it at your table too making it extra melty! Unfortunately we had to pay extra for the cheese, I would've thought it came with it but it was additional +$5 and the rice cakes we ordered was additional +3, also they charged us for packing it to go +1 , also to mention, the side dishes were not good, I looked around and no one seem to touch it either.Good experience and would come back with a group of people as the dish itself was pretty large and could feed at least 4 people,Spicy galbijjim is always amazing here! Add cheese and rice cakes, skip the noodles as they really clump together. The oxtail is also not a great addon as the meat is super chewy and hard to eat.The bibimbap is okay, nothing special," i wish the dolsot made the rice crispier than it does.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Noodle in a Haystack,"Truly an amazing and unique meal! Clint and Yoko have really innovated on a set cuisine around ramen and taken their passion and dedication to a whole new level. I was blown away his the thoughtfulness and hearing about the history of how their dishes came to be through multiple iterations, discovery and adjustments - whimsical but also very purposeful in trying to achieve the best outcome possible. They are both so engaging, down to earth and welcoming. We will be back for sure to see what they come up with next season!クリントとようこさんごち様でした！本当にありがとございました^_^,Noodle in the Haystack is an authentic experience of a passionate chef who has traveled abroad to Japan and is looking to bring his experience and food back home to the Bay. If you're lucky enough to get a reservation, this experience is definitely worth the money that you pay for it. 1. The food was outstanding. You can tell that there was a lot of thought put into each dish, including the story of the ingredients and how they play into each other. The chef has been experimenting with creating his own noodles, and its a shame that we aren't given more to feast on, as you can taste the hard work that has gone into them. Noodle in a Haystack also incorporates ingredients based on their seasonality, ensuring that only the best quality and freshness are presented. The ""Pig in a Blanket"" (Potato wrapped with Wagyu) was definitely spectacular, as the richness of the Wagyu played well with the creaminess and starch of the potato. 2. There are a few unique aspects about this place, including their expensive water filter which produces high quality water that is a treat to drink. 3. The chef is an enthusiastic Bay Area native who wants to bring the Japanese eating experience back home, and you can tell that he is authentic about his passion. He is extremely engaging and will go into detail about each and every dish and the reasons that went into producing it. By some standards, he would be considered an amateur chef, but doubters beware, with more time and experience, he will soon prove to be a chef that sets the standard for the Japanese Fine Dining experience in the Bay Area. 4. The ambience was very nice, as there was a lot of lighting to showcase the kitchen as well the process of making each dish to be served. 5. The only complaints that we would have are that we were still hungry after the meal; perhaps an add-on to the meal is something that can be incorporated into a future menu. The portions are not what I would call generous, though there is a strong argument to be made that the higher the quality the ingredient, the pricier it is, therefore cutting into the amount that can be provided. All-In-All, you would be lucky to get a reservation here. It is worth the price and the hype, and if you want to be able to sample some innovative Japanese cuisine, this is the right place to be!!!,Summary:So much more than just fancy ramenDetails:For the uninitiated, Noodle in a Haystack has been around for many years now, originally operating as a ramen-focused popup at various venues, with reservations that were largely impossible for most to get. Since those early days, the business has evolved significantly, with Clint and Yoko opening up their own brick and mortar space (after many a bureaucratic roadblock), reservations being marginally easier to get (you have a ~15 minute window now instead of ~30 seconds), and the menu having turned into something more akin to kaiseki (though still built around a star noodle dish, of course).I was lucky to nab a last minute opening during their soft launch month, and got to see and taste the fruits of their labor, as my girlfriend and I were treated to a bevy of courses: some, significantly more stellar than others, but all enjoyable in some form, and each presented with a bit of fanfare and background from the couple themselves. While the main noodle (a wagyu aburasoba the day we went) itself was obviously one of the star dishes, their caviar financier, kakuni karaage, and annin kakigori were also particularly outstanding.Absolutely worth a shot if you can snag a reservation. And while $225 after included tax and tip is certainly a steep price for ramen, it's more palatable if you think of it in terms of a tasting menu at a Michelin star restaurant, with the same expectation of care and quality put into the dishes.Accessibility:The space is a bit smaller and comprised of bar counter seating only, but they specifically designed a wheelchair accessible portion with a lower counter towards the far end!,I have been in love with Noodle in a Haystack and Clint & Yoko since 2016 and I am so happy I finally got to eat at their new restaurant. To be honest, I was unsure when the restaurant would open, but it was definitely worth the wait! The open faced chef's table-esque kitchen and modern/sleek design is extremely welcoming and the lighting is great for photos. I didn't tell Clint & Yoko this, but this was one of my first meals after recovering from food poisoning so I was unsure if I was going to even enjoy it, but oh boy, was this one of my favorite meals of the year. I can talk about all of the dishes in detail, but here are some of my favorites: +Japanese Avocado Toast - Mashed avocado with smoked trout on top of a deep fried donut hole. Finished with finger limes and a cold pressed African Green Chilli oil. This was magical... +Spanish blue fin toro tar tar tart - Toro on top of a tart? Got to love that ingenuity! Inspired by a sushi roll, they top it off with a regular pickle, smoked pickle, and shishito leaf. +Wagyu Abura Ramen - First of all, can we talk about the noodles they are using? Wagyu, wagyu butter, and those beautiful noodles. Come on! I mean come on! I am drooling just thinking about this. This was the star. I could have eaten a couple bowls of this. Also, Clint & Yoko are some of the nicest people I have ever met and it brings me so much joy to eat their food in such a beautiful space. For $150 a person, you get at least 7-8 courses and an intimate dining experience. They are rotating their menu and experimenting with local and seasonal ingredients so my experience will probably be different from the next person, but it is definitely worth trying out if you can snag a reservation!,Looks out of business. Nothing there. No sign, locked gate. No indication a restaurant is there.,I had a phenomenal dining experience at Noodle in a Haystack! One glance at the name and you'd immediately think that it's just a ramen shop, but there are SO many layers here. It's an omakase and ramen shop with Asian fusion vibes and a monthly ramen style. They're constantly experimenting with new recipes, so the menu is always changing. The 8 courses ($125/person) were rich with flavor, umami, and creativity. While the star of the show was definitely the beautifully crafted and delicious ramen, the other food elements still lingered in my mind. My taste buds were dancing because I was transported back to my time in Japan.BONUS: Clint and Yoko are super sweet, kind, thoughtful, and knowledgeable! They initially ran their pop-up around the Bay Area, but the Kickstarter project helped bring their dream of opening a shop in SF to life. The current seating arrangement allows each guest to easily communicate with them. Clint explained each dish (and fun facts) with immaculate detail. They also have a special Pi-water filter!Note that this restaurant has no defined menu, so the items below might not be the same when you visit. However, there will probably be variations of these items. Either way, you won't be disappointed :) 1. Avocado toast with chili olive oil: Bite-sized bread with avocado. It looks really simple, but the acidity and flavor were very balanced.2. Rice crackers with uni and mix of fresh fish: The rice crackers brings me back to my childhood. The uni and fish were incredibly fresh and creamy. I need more of this in my life. 3. Kanpachi with ponzu sauce: Great ponzu sauce with a nice crunch from the onions!4. Chilled tofu: The sauce was inspired by tantanmen and mala, so you'll get a nice kick of umami. It was so smooth.5. 16-hour braised pork belly: WOW, the best pork belly that I've ever had. It literally MELTED in my mouth. Smooth like butter *cues BTS song* :) This gave me KBBQ vibes because of the meat + salad combo.6. Radish and pickled vegetables (shared between 2 people): So refreshing and tasty! I'd love to have this on the side at all times.7. Abura soba ramen: THE best ramen I've ever had and on the same wavelength as the best ramen places in Japan. This gave me Mi Goreng vibes, but amplified x1000. The onions were sweet and mild without the spicy onion flavor. Their wagyu butter and wagyu fat mousse in the sauce were divine. Soak the noodles with the orange egg yolk for some extra creamy flavor. It was SO FREAKING DELICIOUS.8. Almond jello with kiwi and shaved ice: Great way to end the night with super light dessert!,I've been a fan of Noodle in a Haystack since my first dinner with them through Feastly all the way back in 2016. Dinners were always hard to get into since it was a pop-up so I am super excited that Clint and Yoko have finally achieved their goal of opening a restaurant in SF. I happily backed their Kickstarter and thus managed to snag a spot for dinner last Monday. Navigating the SF permitting process was quite an ordeal, glad they made it through! Somehow they've managed to replicate the close-knit feel of dining in their home in the restaurant setting (except their charming dog Toto is no longer able to run around hanging out with diners).Over the years people have been surprised when I've mentioned how much the meals are (and I've seen the same in comments on the SF Chronicle articles about them). You don't get just a single bowl of ramen (although what a bowl of ramen it is!). It's a multi course menu with every course showing the thoughtfulness and care that Clint and Yoko put in. I also love hearing Clint describe all of the dishes and the background behind them.I guess I should talk more about last week's dinner. The wagyu abura soba was decadent. The deviled ramen eggs had been a mainstay on their menu (but I'm excited by the prospect of it being replaced with something new as Clint said he was thinking). The burrata spoon was an amazing interplay of flavors and one of my favorites of the night. The tofu with crab and roe was so comforting and reminiscent of shark fin's soup actually. The pork belly was so divine! And the dessert was the perfect end to the night, so refreshing. I also got the sake pairing, and all the sakes were great.Noodle in a Haystack has felt like it's been a bit of a secret for so long and now everyone else can discover it. I wish Clint and Yoko lots of success!,We started trying to get reservations for this place in 2019 and finally got them in 2020, but unfortunately with the pandemic it got pushed several times. After 2 whole years we were finally able to reschedule for their kickstarter and it was well worth the long wait. This restaurant is super intimate with just 8-12 seating and there's only 3 staff members including Yoko and Clint. Throughout our dinner, we were able to hear about their journey in opening their new space and unfortunately, they're actually not allowed to have a full kitchen setup due to permit issues. We saw them using portable burners to cook the ramen and a toaster oven to heat up their proteins. However, with that said, it's still amazing what they can create even with limited resources available. We got our reservations with the Wagyu Abura Soba and our meal consisted of  7 courses. It included appetizers, small dishes/palette cleansers, ramen, and dessert. Each course was delicious in their own ways and it was actually more food than I anticipated. I was stuffed by the end of the meal and I ended up giving some of my ramen to my bf to finish because I wanted to save room for dessert. It's definitely hard to get reservations here, but definitely keep trying because it's so worth it. For the quality of their craft and ingredients, I agree with another yelper and can foresee them getting a Michelin Star somewhere in the future. Hoping they will reopen their reservations again soon so we can come back!,I originally had reservations for this pre-pandemic pop-up celebrating home-made Japanese noodles for March 13, 2020. In the two-and-a-half years since my aborted reservation, the restaurant found a brick-and-mortar location and appears to have developed a singular vision of how to elevate a college-food staple to fine dining extravagance.Every ingredient is steamed, frozen, puréed, broiled, grilled, whatever, all in an effort to stun the palate. Even sesame seeds and lettuce are intentional choices to highlight the husband-and-wife chefs' creativity.It's still a soft opening, and the regular kinks of post-pandemic dining out persist, but this is a restaurant doing something no one else is doing and doing it impressively.,To tell you about this place, I literally never heard of them before I saw them on the social media and really interested to try out their ramen since I'm a ramen lover. But they have just opened the shop just a few months ago and before that they were just doing pop-up. So I tried to find a way to get a reservation and you could make it on Tock. I was on the waitlist and luckily, I got a seats. So let's talk about the restaurant and food now.The restaurant has no sign and it's really new. Clean looks and only table seating. I got there early and got to seated first. Nice counter bar. We got the beverage menu and order the sake pairing.First : the devils egg with crispy chicken skins and salmon roe Second : tofu with tomato like caprese saladThird : sashimi Hawaiian amberjackFourth : tofu crab with Uni Fifth : deep fried pork belly saladSixth : housemade ramen noodle Seventh : shaved ice Overall: food was good but only little things that could be improved such as the temperature and the fat of the beef was chewy. Service was very friendly but with the price of 125$ that you could also go enjoy at some Michelin star. Still need to step up a little bit. Looking forward to come back again though when they change the menu.,So happy to be able to support Noodle in a Haystack from day 1. Clint and Yoko are the only people bringing Michelin quality ramen to San Francisco and everyone needs to know about it. You can tell each dish is crafted with so much care and thought. From the first course ramen egg (a standard dish from pop-up days) to the star abura soba/ramen with custom noodles to the last shaved yuzu ice/kiwi almond pudding (amazing iteration of the shaved yuzu ice!). Run, don't walk, or you'll miss your chance!,Finally found time to have our kickstarter meal. Such a great experience and nice to see Clint and Yoko in their new modern space.Pork belly and ramen were the standouts but every course was meticulous and wonderful. Thanks guys for a wonderful experience and look forward to coming back soon.,I took a three day ramen trip to the Bay Area this past week and got to tick so many amazing bowls and shops.  However the main reason for my trip was to hit up Noodle in a Haystack.  They've been on my radar for the last two years after first hearing about them in passing on an old Way of Ramen podcast.  Back then the owners/chefs/husband & wife duo, Clint and Yoko, were hosting popup dinner parties out of their apartment.  Last year they began the arduous journey of opening up their own brick & mortar in SF.  While they hit many bumps in the road they persevered finally opening about a month ago starting their soft opening.  Right now reservations are primarily opened to their kickstarter members.  I was really lucky to score one.  They're open 3-4 days a week with 10 seats and two seatings per evening.Though they are known for their exquisite ramen bowls and used to get their noodles from Shimamoto Noodle they are not your typical ramen shop.  I don't know what their culinary backgrounds are but they make some world class food.  Their dinners consist of seven courses, with an option to add a sake pairing, with the ramen being the main and final savory course.For this dinner they served an A5 wagyu abura soba.  The bowl is topped with slices of olive fed A5 wagyu picanha, a poached egg, menma, microgreens, diced onion and nori.  The sauce consists of A5 wagyu butter, a two week aged shoyu tare and a three fish dashi.  The noodles are made by Iseya Craft Noodle, they are an up and coming Bay Area noodle maker supporting the local craft popup ramen scene.The abura soba would be worth ordering by itself at any ramen shop or fine dining restaurant.  It was so amazing as you got a nice beefy aroma with every bite and slurp from the wagyu butter.  The dashi and shoyu tare really upped the umami and mixed together with the egg every noodle was perfectly coated.Besides this dish the rest of the dinner was amazing.  Every component was thoughtfully prepared and the amount of r&d they did is just mind boggling.  The entire meal consisted of:1. Japanese avocado toast2. Kanpachi crudo3. Summer seafood parfait with Baja uni, tomato dashi gelee, flash steamed prawns and a bunch of other stuff I'm missing4. Tantan burrata5. 16 hour braised pork belly karaage, this was one of my favorite courses.  The outside was crunchy while the inside had the texture of a marshmallow6. Pickled daikon & cucumbers7. A5 wagyu abura soba8. Almond tofu w/ yuzu shaved ice & golden kiwi preservesThey'll be switching their menu soon as their soft opening winds down.  They're hoping to offer ramen on their future tasting menus.  I definitely will be back for that in the next 2-3 months!,I didn't know that there was such a restaurant in San Francisco. It's not often that I have such an exciting experience before eating a ramen.The mazesoba was especially good with the noodles.I could feel the passion and sincerity of the chef and staff. Next time I want ramen with soup.,I'm pretty overwhelmed writing this review of Noodle & Haystack today because not only did I get a chance to check out their brand new space in SF as part of their first wave of #kickstarter backers, but I'm floored by how incredible the food has become. My relationship with Noodle & Haystack go way back to when they had their at-home pop ups where the seating arrangements were a mix of dining room table and comfy couch buming. While unassuming, I loved Clint & Yoko's approach to food because they were such big experimenters. Don't know what kind of noodle to pair with a soup? Try them all! Don't really feel like a piece of pork is perfect enough? Create 6, 7, 8 variations based on time to get that perfect cook. Need just that little more umami? Source the entire Bay Area, and then beyond to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and other parts of Asia for the perfect seasoning, oil, flavoring or specialty sauce to compliment the dish. While I was impressed by their sheer will to make the best ramen, literally for themselves, because this is how it all started and thrilled they decided to share their love with the rest of the world; I barely have words for their new menu in their inner Richmond space. The restaurant is clean, airy, inviting, with hints of Japanese zen and honestly such a beautiful bathroom inside! The bar is massive and all encompassing, but at the same time humble with a simple clear lacquer over raw wooden knots sanded smooth. The atmosphere is both crisp and warm, inviting plenty of conversation the same way that it did in their home. The ramen is, of course, the star, but not to be missed are all the accompaniments and appetizer dishes that came before it. Even while I loved every morsel of food their used to serve in their home pop ups, the restaurant simply elevates all of these flavors. Clearly some of us stewed around in the pandemic while Clint & Yoko perfected their ramen deviled eggs, poke and pork belly dishes to level 11. I'm even more impressed knowing all the hurdles they have had to overcome to open this space, while still giving 120% into the creativity that makes up all of the aspects of their menu including the ramen.Now, the ramen. What more can I say other than they've RUINED ME FOR LIFE. THANKS GUYS. I can't say that I find another ramen spot in the US that comes close to their unique but flavor-packed way of pairing the perfect noodle with the perfect serving style. Nothing in the bowl is too much or too little, or there for decoration, or by mistake. I've watched enough Top Chef in my life to know this is a showcase of a sophisticated palate with an incredible amount of skill. I hope everyone gets a chance to try Noodle & Haystack soon, but secretly hope that it can still remain accessible as my perfect ramen spot.,Had such an amazing experience here! Visiting Clint and Yoko at Noodle in a Haystack was definitely something my husband and I will remember.I waited a few months to get this reservation. I set story notifications on their Instagram account, praying for a last minute opening or getting wind of more seats for their soft open. My patience paid off!Seating is very intimate, with an L-shaped bar surrounding the cooking/prep area. There were about 7 other guests at our seating. My husband and I are comfortable in these settings and had a good time chatting with a couple other people at our seating. In the center is Clint and Yoko putting together the dishes and explaining the inspiration for each. Clint and Yoko are humble, kind, honest people who literally just love food so much that they opened up this business. Hearing their story was inspiring and touching, and Clint is personable and welcoming of conversation. I honestly feel like this is what made the experience so good. It truly just felt like I was at one of my friend's dinner parties, except every single food item was exceptional! It felt so exclusive and special, without feeling stuffy and pretentious.I can't say enough about the food. I booked this reservation because I knew the ramen was supposed to be good, but wow, every other course was unexpected and mind-blowing. So much time, thought, attention-to-detail, and love go into each dish. I can't even name them all -- just know that their corn soup-inspired dish, 16-hour braised pork, yuzu shaved ice dessert, and of COURSE the ramen were delicious! Clint and Yoko really know what they're doing. We will absolutely be back and recommending this place a hundred times over. We are even planning on gifting some close friends and family a reservation because that's how much of a good time we had. The only thing that makes me sad is that this place is going to blow up more than it already has and it's going to be even harder to get a reservation! It was an honor, Clint and Yoko!,i have been following noodle in a haystack (husband and wife team: clint and yoko) for a long time. i tried to get seats for their pop ups in their home kitchen, but sadly i was never lucky. the ramen and other dishes they cooked all looked so amazing, i couldn't wait to try.following them in instagram is def important and a must! i found out they are planning to open a restaurant back in 2021. and now they are finally in their soft opening in SF! reservations are still tough. right now, it is all booked but able to join the waitlist. and that is how i got lucky. i set a bunch of dates on alert... and wow, i did get lucky. i got a notification and next thing you know... at 8pm on a week night,  i was standing outside their restaurant waiting to get in.the space is pretty small but not cramped at all. it is a counter bar seating with 12 seats available.  there were only 3 staffed: clint and yoko, of course and another chef. they made it worked. it was a casual and informal, clint will go over each dish in great detail. even told us how it was cooked and how long, and recipes that were used. i totally love this setting where we can talk, interact and ask questions!now for the food! it is a tasting menu where each dish consists of individual elements of ramen before the finale, which is an a5 wagyu abura soba (this month's style of ramen and more on final dish later)1.) deviled ramen egg. wow. this was soo good. i never had egg like it before! ""egg from the land, egg from sea""-clint. so very true! he added some ikura to it and some smoked fish powder.2.) kanpachi crudo: yuzu dashi ponzu. so fresh. and refreshing!3.) dashi uni tofu: homemade silken tofu with ikura, crab. 4.) tan tan salad: bean sprouts. i didn't think tan tan would work as bean sprouts but this was so good! it's spicy with a hint of mala. 5.) pork belly kakuni karaage: pork belly has been braised for 14 hours then solidified by freezing it. so can have that crunch on the inside but glutinous in the inside. amazing!!! clint basically tells u all this while he presents the dish. they also serve it with lettuce. i forget what kind of dressing but it was refreshing. it def goes with well that pork belly to balance it out. 6.) pickled daikon and mustard greens. which is refreshing before the finale!7.) ramen time :))  a5 wagyu abura soba. clint makes it front of you. i think i heard wagyu butter with dashi. it's kind of like tsukemen noodles but without the separate broth. since he already mixes it with dashi, wagyu butter, shoyu tare. it was just amazing! it just went so well together. and those noodles.. woww..... it was the perfect texture. and that egg.... this ramen was amazing!!!! i need some more. also, they recommend adding some mala chile crisp to your ramen. amazing!!! i wish i could take that jar home :p dessert: kakigoori (shaved ice) i think it was almond jelly with kiwi and pineapple? it was just the right ending to conclude such an epic, awesome, amazing meal. they said they will probably change the styleof ramen each month. that means, i gotta go here all the time so i can try all the ramen ive seen they made! if i get lucky with another reservation. i am so so happy and grateful that i finally tried their amazing food. it was just perfect, fromthe start to the end. i already can't wait to come back!they also have beer and sake for their drink menu. and the best tapped water. trust me, it was good.,I first met Clint and Yoko years ago when they were hosting Noodle in a Haystack as a pop-up in their home and I have been a big fan ever since. So naturally, I was so excited for them when they decided to open a ramen-focused restaurant and happily backed their Kickstarter! The intimate dining experience was excellent. Clint and Yoko are a seamless team, effortlessly engaging with their guests while at the same time assembling each dish right before your eyes.  All of the dishes in their pre fixe menu have a ramen theme, whether through creative uses of ingredients or fun injections of familiar ramen flavors. We ordered a nice bottle of sake, which paired perfectly with the meal. The space has an elegant minimalistic vibe, which only makes the food and plating stand out even more! The whole dining experience was just so fun! I can't wait to see how the menu changes over time and can't wait to come back!,Very beautiful  and intimate experience. Clint and Yoko literally have taken us into their new home to feed us this delicious meal. Ending with the best version of dry ramen I've had outside of Tokyo. I'm sick of long ass meals. Over it. Unless there's a massage half way through, I don't want it. Privilege and a general waste of time. I don't need to waste three hours on a movie nor a meal. Saying that, I've had a lot of three hour meals. I've come to treat them with disdain. Two hours baby. At Haystack we sat down at 8pm. Left at 10 pm. They'll get even better with the flow but two hours for 6-8 courses was perfect. Technique is very detailed and specific. That's the only way you can make Deviled Eggs signature. Bean Sprouts Salad.  Signature. Pickles. Signature. The eggs are an example of their style of fusion. Textural contrast with the daikon and crispy chicken skin. Acidulation. Cream/Fat. Perfect. Something common elevated. Bean sprouts?  You gotta have very large balls to serve cheap ass bean sprouts as a course. I said this to myself then I ate it and wanted more. So unique, simple and fucking delicious. Creamy. Crunchy. Not watery. The pickles were so understated they were beautiful. Served on their own was extremely intelligent. This was technically sound and extremely difficult to get the balance right. You got to the soul of the ingredient then you got the pickle. The sashimi though not as cold as I want was soigne. This had finger limes, and a garlic oil or something that made it taste like a raw fish stir fry. These were highlights. Ramen is there game and they are playing pro mvp all star hall of fame level. They say they have about 20 versions so we are in for a ride. Be patient and be so proud of these two artisans doing there thing out in the Richmond.,WOW. What a wonderful, memorable meal. We went to their popup pre-pandemic and were so excited when they announced they were opening a brick and mortar, and it was definitely worth the wait. Every bite was obviously carefully considered and so delicious. I loved that it is very intimate - just 12 seats and you get to talk a lot to them as they prepare and serve your food. I think my favorite dishes were the pork belly karaage with the ma la shiso, the tuno crudo, and of course, the wagyu ramen, but everything was really killer - not a single dud. The ramen was so rich and unctuous - they compared it to carbonara which is pretty apt - and the noodles have such great, toothsome texture. We also appreciated that there was a decent amount of vegetables in the earlier courses - it feels like a lot of tasting menus can be too focused only on protein and this one felt more balanced. Clint and Yoko are so friendly and we loved talking to them about food and restaurants and life. It's not inexpensive but it's a great value for the amount of food, and really a steal when you consider the quality of the ingredients and the amount of work and time that have gone into each component. I imagine reservations may be hard to come by since it's so small and so excellent, but I can't wait to go back!,This is the hardest reservation to get in the San Francisco Bay area. This is a strong 2, maybe 3 Michelin star experience. A top 2 meal in my life.Clint and Yoko have written a love letter to ultra refined Japanese flavors and umami with their Noodle in a Haystack tasting menu. Each dish is a poem to the carefully selected ingredients, where umami, acidity, texture, temperature, and depth are artfully balanced. The layering of garnish, sauces, oils, and acidity in each dish is masterful. The piece de resistance of my tasting menu was a fried 16 hour cooked pork belly, which was a textural adventure; crispy on the outside, melting on the inside, with different internal and external flavor profiles brought on my the pork's fattyness and the sauces on the inside and outside.All dishes feature numerous techniques. The amount of touches diners see put on them by Client and Yoko in their well rehearsed open-kitchen choreography is borderline dizzying. Clint and Yoko narrate the development of each dish, some which have been workshopped for 8+ years to get to their masterpiece state. They are excellent hosts and their conversations and story's during service really add an intimate personal connection.As an ultimate compliment to the chefs, I did not leave a single morsel of food on my plates when the 7 course menu was complete.Do what you need to do to get a seat at this restaurant, becauseit is truly an unforgettable masterpiece.,Absolutely phenomenal! I was incredibly impressed by Clint and Yoko's attention to detail. Easily one of the best food I've had in the Bay Area!,The hope of this meal began last summer 2021 with a kickstarter purchase. A long awaited email came late in the night to book a seat at their newly built 12-seat custom crafted pine counter in the Inner Richmond. Every bite had complex flavors balancing umami, sweetness, salt, acid and different textures. Each dish showcased the height of freshness and very essence of the ingredients. Clint and Yoko put so much thought into every dish and you can taste the love they put into their food - this was one of the best meals I've had in a long time! And the level of cuisine served utilizing limited equipment displays their skill in cooking food using simple methods but mindful techniques. They respect food, the ingredients available and serving high quality ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ishes. I loved the intimate style of service, where chefs could explain how they prepared the courses and allowing diners to ask questions. They have really embraced the ingredients that makeup ramen and used different elements in the various dishes leading up to the main course. What an amazing experience and setup!Favorite bites of the night: deviled egg, toro taku served on crispy rice seaweed, pickled Nozawana, and picanha. I can't wait for an opportunity to try the rest of their ramen creations! Gochisosama deshita!!!,Clint and Yoko blew my mind this evening. Every course was perfectly thought out and balanced the next out. The intention and love they've put in to their restaurant is so refreshing. An absolute must visit for anyone. The ramen was perfectly flavored and the noodles were like anything else. The dessert was likely one of the best I've had in my life. Wishing them so much success.,I came here with my wife on my daughter's recommendation. Not really knowing what to expect, I was pleasantly surprised from start to finish. Clint and Yoko are truly passionate about what they do, from explaining the various dishes to the presentation. Every dish was thoughtfully curated to give the customer a unique experience. This is a place long overdue for San Francisco. Noodle in a Haystack is a culinary experience even the late Anthony Bourdain would rave about.,My sister surprised me with reservations for their 'wild card' ramen which turned out to be chicken paiten. Now, I don't even like chicken. Because of this, my sister ended up having to convince me to even go. I knew the general price range was around $60-ish a person so why take someone who doesn't like the main dish???? She was like, c'mon just give them a try. FINEEEEEEEEEE.Anyways, so glad I went. Your dinner is at their home, so make sure to wear shoes you can take off as they'll have you do this before entering. They also have a cute little golden doodle named Toto. SUPERRRRR cute and friendly but worth noting in case someone has allergies. Onto the food!First appetizer: Deviled ramen eggs. Smoked fish powder gives a great smokey finish, daicon radish as well, which was noted as the secret ingredient, with roe and a shoyu zuke topping. Easily THE BEST deviled eggs I've had. Second appetizer: Hokkaido parfait. A dashi jelly, marinated ichura (sorry about bad spelling, I just feel this is wrong lol), tomatoes from Maum farms - peeled nonetheless, seared salmon with hokkaido uni on top, and pinch of lime and uzu on top. I was scraping the damn bowl this was so amazing. Better than the first appetizer even those that was also amazing.Third appetizer: Totto Taku. Inspired off of the roll. Chopped up lean and fatty blue fin tuna from Spain mixed with onion and daikon takuan pickles. Because the main dish is noodles, they removed the rice and seaweed normally in the totto taku roll and used a rice puff instead so you don't accidentally get filled up. They marinated the tuna in a homemade blended soy sauce and cured it for 30 minutes. This was good but felt it should've been the second appetizer as while I liked it, and it had great flavors and textures, it just didn't stand up next to the second appetizer. Fourth appetizer: the white daikon is an uzu daikon that's less pickled so you can taste the flavor more. The other was mustard greens, marinated in a cold pressed African chili oil. Both good but this would've been better as a side dish to the ramen. Could've sent the ramen out then passed out the greens.Main meal: Chicken Paiten. Created from a two day broth process, as your host Clint says, made from pure chicken love. They actually make the chicken broth for two days, then to order they create a dashi broth to create a light, but filling paiten broth. Remember I don't eat chicken. This was phenomenal. The noodles were also perfect. Flown in weekly from the Ramen Shack owner in NYC, the shimamoto noodles are perfect. They bring out a spicy paste (can't remember the name) to add to your ramen broth if you want it spicier, but it's just not necessary.Dessert: Ice cream sando. Homemade vanilla ice cream, kinachu powder, farmers market strawberries sandwiched between two monaka rice wafers flown in from Japan, stamped with their logo. Nice light dessert to wrap up the evening. The food is spectacular, totally worth every penny. They make everything with fresh, traditional Japanese ingredients, with quality you'll never find at any other Japanese place here in the Bay. Clint is the main person who you'll interact with as his wife does the majority of the cooking. He is friendly, informative, and super helpful as he's educating you on what flavors to look for in each dish, while recommending other Japanese food spots you may enjoy if you're looking for traditional Japanese meals. He even said he'd give us recommendations for our upcoming Japan trip which is very helpful! Overall, loved it. Hope I can go back and try their other ramens as well.,It's like watching Netflix's Chef's Table live in person. Or it's like having a Michelin star chef exclusively preparing amazing dishes just for you vis-á-vis. That's how I felt and it made me feel special.,Fantastic ramen pop-up in Daly City.This is a small pop-up restaurant inside a couple's house (Yoko and Clint) in Daly City.  You'll sit around a shared table that seats 8 or at a sofa that seats 4. It's intimate and you can / should certainly talk to your neighbors and the hosts.To be clear, I'm not a ramen guy. I lived in San Mateo and tried many of the 'best' ramen places, including Ramen Dojo, and I've always been unimpressed.  Friends are constantly dragging me to ramen places," which I've started calling """"Asian mac-n-cheese."""" (This insight came after many drunk/high nights", when Wisconsinites like myself rush home for a late night Easy Mac, and my Asian friends whip up some NongShim Black Instant Ramen.)But now I understand what ramen can be.  This was delightful, intricate, packed with layers of flavor and just the right balance of umami.  The Ajitsuke Tamago (ramen egg) was divine. zomg.This pop-up reminded me a bit of my experience at Lazy Bear in the very early days or at Ichido.  That is to say, I loved it.  It's great to meet the chefs and entrepreneurs that pour their heart into a craft culinary experience.  Yoko and Clint were fantastic hosts and I'll remember the meal for a while.Pro:+ Friendly hosts+ Craft culinary experience with exquisite care put into every detail+ Fantastic ramen and delicious appetizers and amuse bouche+ BYOB. I recommend studying the menu and Googling for a quality pairing - this meal deserves a good match.Cons:- $60 prix fixe, but reasonable given the quality and care put into the meal- Difficult to get a reservation - sells out in minutes each month.- Located in Daly City, so a bit of a trek for carless city residents- Not great for a date given the communal seating and inability to linger given the multiple seatings- No alcohol pairing available (yet, I hope!),Finally snagged tickets after months of trying and omg it was so worth it. A lot has already been said about the fine folks that run this pop up and I am just going to go ahead and reaffirm what everyone else is saying - the food is excellent, the chefs are experts at their craft and are lovely hosts. The hype is real and completely justified - if you are lucky enough to get a ticket, you will have a great time. I've got to try their Yuzu Shio ramen and I came away very delighted. It was a creative and well balanced bowl - among the best I've had in Japan. Super impressive considering this is done in a home kitchen. The appetizers that come before the ramen are masterpieces on their own. Just ogle the photos and try to get a ticket.,Long overdue review for the best pop-up Ramen in the SF Bay Area. Clint and Yoko prepare the best intimate pop-up ramen experience that begins with the best deviled eggs and then progresses to a pair of nice appetizers (including sunimono and, at one of the meals, the best ever pork belly hash) to a meticulously prepared bowl of ramen to a nice dessert.  Paitan is my favorite Ramen of theirs but the dry ramen is spectacular as well. It's always a nice and satisfying meal and it feels like the perfect amount of food (at a lot of places, I always feel like I either ate too much or I need another burger).  I used to be able to go to their events in SF through Feastly but most of the pop-up meals happen in their home in Daly City nowadays. Highly recommended!!!,Yoko & Clint cook some very beautiful and delicious dishes at their home in Daly City, where a majority of these seatings take place.It's a fun and intimate experience, as you sit at a communal table right next to the kitchen, where you can view the couple preparing the food. Their dog Toto is a cute greeter and presence throughout the meal. The bigger table with attachment fits 11, and there's also space for a few on the couches. When Clint brings out each course, he describes the ingredients and preparation work that went in to everything, which is quite informational and enlightening.In our 5 course ramen seatings, we had two small plates/bites, a bigger appetizer, a side of pickles/veggies, the main ramen course, and a dessert in total. It's BYOD, but they offer a couple of drinks to purchase as well.They start off with their deviled ramen egg, which is garnished with fried chicken skin, salmon roe, pickle, and packed with mouthwatering smoky, fishy flavor. I have to echo everyone's sentiment in saying these are the best deviled eggs I've ever eaten, and are not likely ever to be topped! It's unbelievable how much time, care, and precision is put into just half of an egg bite, but it definitely shows.During my two visits," the second dish that came out was the """"Hokkaido style tar-tart""""", which includes a menagerie of marinated seafood topped with Santa Barbara uni, sitting on a rice wafer. It's a great appetite-whetting bite of the ocean, and also my boyfriend's first time eating uni - which he loved!For our bigger appetizers, they've made a pork belly karaage and a gyudon. The pork belly karaage had a nice light crisp fried coat just perfect as to not weigh down our stomachs right before ramen. It came with a sauce that tasted like a muted Thousand Island dressing but paired so great with the pork belly, that I was pressing my karaage pieces to the plate to soak up any trace of it. The salad that accompanied the karaage was so well tossed in their homemade veggie-grette - the best salad dressing I've ever had!The gyudon was a nice homely comfort bowl of rice with tender beef slices and cooked down onions.The rice they use is a premium Japanese rice, which made it so fluffy and moist - I ate every last grain.In my first seating, the pickles they served right before the ramen were shaved celery and baby ginger... literally two of my most hated root vegetables! It was so amusing because I always pick pieces of these out of whatever dish I'm eating. However, they selected and pickled these well that the celery was tolerable while retaining that dirt taste, and the ginger became somewhat addictive with the spice and katsuobushi. The second time around, the baby ginger returned and I got to taste their daikon flavored with yuzu, which was less wet and more bitter than the ones at restaurants - a great palette cleanser for the oncoming ramen.Yoko & Clint's attention to their ramen recipes is superb. They fly Shimamoto ramen noodles in from New York, and the chew, texture, and flavor hold was excellent. In my first experience here, I had the ma-ze tan tan men, and I fell in love. Best non-traditional ramen ever. The flavors of the ma-ze tan tan men made it so perfect: the juicy chashu, the crunchy blanched bean sprouts, the earthy mushrooms, the fresh cilantro, and that chili sauce! The idea is to break the poached egg and mix it with everything, like a carbonara. It was flavor and texture heaven.I just came back from the yuzu shio seating, which was also amazing. Basically, they make a chicken stock and fish stock laboriously and mix it together with citrus, which is my crudest simple explanation. The broth is very light, but complex with so many flavors folded into it. The shio flavor has a unique acidity from the yuzu citrus and fishiness from the different fishes that went into it. I love how the chicken literally tastes like plump ham slices, how generous the homemade wonton shrimp and pork filling is, and the added touch of pink peppercorn for spice and aesthetic.For dessert, we've had their homemade froyo and dorayaki. The froyo was topped with crepe crumbs, matcha granola, and a strawberry jam. It was creamy, icy, crunchy, and texturally fun and yummy, with well balanced flavors! The other dessert I had, the dorayaki, blew my mind! The pancake patties were so small, delicate, and fluffy. They were excellent vessels for the whipped cream, brown sugar, and fresh persimmons. If I could, I would have swallowed everyone else's whole!I am absolutely blown away and so grateful that I found Noodle in a Haystack. It was perfect for me as I live nearby, so it's extremely convenient for me to go to any seating... The hardest part is waiting for a month for the actual seating, as they release their availability a month prior to the dates. The seats sell out in the first minutes they open, so you really need to have that alarm set for this extraordinary meal!,Amazing noodles and accompanying dishes in Daly City! We heard about Clint and Yoko's fabulous pop-up from another friend and booked a meal to try. We were blown away and came back for more! Their dog Toto is the cutest host ever! They switched to Tock in late 2018 and are getting quite popular. If you sign up for their email list, they will email out a notice at 9pm for available bookings the next month at 10pm. I made the mistake of booking on the wrong date because I clicked too fast but when I contact Clint and Yoko, they were able to actually open back up the ticktets and cancel it for me....which most restaurants on Tock do not do and you'd have to find a friend to transfer your reservation to. I definitely appreciated that and will be sure to look carefully when booking! It's just that you have to book ASAP when the clock strikes 10pm because it sells out within 5 minutes(or less).,Belated post, but it's the thought that counts! I took my mom on a mother-daughter date to Noodle in a Haystack. In hindsight, bringing my super picky mother to a at home ramen pop-up was a bit of a risky choice, but Noodle in a Haystack delivered! We arrived late, so we ended up sitting on Clint and Yoko's couch-- not an issue at all though. It was nice to have a bit of privacy and their dog Toto kept us company. We were both so impressed by the meal, not only did everything taste AMAZING, but we had so much food. When my mom left, she was immediately thinking about going back. That is the ultimate stamp of approval from Mama Fabulous. I enjoyed the small dishes so much, that I was stuffed by the time the ramen came out. My favorite of all was the ramen deviled egg. The price may seem a little high for ramen, but this unique experience and the multiple courses really does justify the price tag. Try for yourself!,Noodle in a Haystack is a must try ramen pop up! I found them through my friends ig when they hosted a event at paina for the 80 bowls of ramen! I've been to three of their pop ups and I have to say, my bf and I are thoroughly impressed. I absolutely love how every month they host several pop ups in their home and it's a different flavor each time. When we went it was for the abura ramen and the ma-ze men. Yoko and Clint are amazing with the recipes they come up! You can obviously tell they put in a lot of time and effort to give you a unique experience. The appetizers that they have done are all delicious from the deviled egg , the pork belly, the sous vide beef all of those were absolutely delicious! They are pretty thoughtful as well, I had told them I went to the ma-ze men pop up at paina earlier that week and they offered to make something different for me. I told them it wasn't necessary, but that's really nice of them.Both of these ramens were dry versions but they were so flavorful and delicious. You do need to mix them up thoroughly to coat the noodles with the sauces on the bottom. The pork they add in is so tender and flavorful, it literally melts in your mouth. Not sure what else I can say about this pop up except that if you haven't tried, then you should try! Total for 2:$110,First to review! First, let me start by saying ramen is my absolute favorite dish and I've had enough bowls that I should probably learn how to make it myself by now. But I don't. Sooo instead I eat ramen everywhere and this is my #67 ramen joint on yelp :) That doesn't count Ramen Parlor that I've been to about 20+ times now haha.So my standards for ramen are high. And I have to say, I absolutely loved's Clint's ramen!! Both soup ramen and dry. I dined with him at an EatWith event where he had the following menu:Aburi Caesar Salad - Charred Romaine & Leeks, Burnt scallion-Miso-Caesar dressing, crispy anchovies. Delicious and so unique. I've never had charred romain lettuce before. Takonomiyaki - a mix between takoyaki and okonomiyaki. Genius and perfect!Tsukemono - pickles to cleanse your palette Ma-ze-men (Dry Ramen) - Eats like a pasta. Splash of ramen broth with fermented chilis, lime,  umami powder, 3 day ramen egg, pork belly, cracklin'. Amazing!! Flavorful sauce found in the bottom of the bowl, and once mixed together, you get a fantastic saucey noodle dish that makes you want more. I was surprised at how good this unconventional dry ramen was and am craving for more.Chicken Paitan Ramen - Creamy 10 hr chicken bone broth & dashi, melt-in-mouth pork belly chashu, 3 day ramen egg. Wow. Just wow...let me tell you, I've never had any bowl like this in America. This is the most traditional bowl of ramen I've had here and it took me back to Japan. It didn't have all the extra junk that they have here, just rich enough to be flavorful and also have that sardine and dashi flavor they use in Japan. I was shocked at the taste and kept telling Clint to open up a ramen shop because it will no doubt prosper and become famous. However he stated that this is his passion and it's more enjoyable to cook and talk to his customers, which I respect. I'll just have to dine through EatWith again to have another taste of this amazing ramen.The only critique I would give would be that I wish the ramen egg was soft boiled. It was a little overdone for both the dry and paitan ramen, however it still had flavor nonetheless. Clint and his wife were both extremely friendly, nice, sweet, and I absolutely loved the dinner and experience. I honestly can't say which ramen I liked more since they were both great. I would say, choose what you're in the mood for, dry or soup. You won't go wrong with either :),Really thoughtful cooking by Clint, his wife and friend. We were there for the maze tan tan ramen,  and it was rich and delicious. Thought the early bites (uni, avo cracker) and interesting ingredients they use (that jalapeno? oil from Monterey!) made for really memorable moments too. Go and support them!,I've been here at about 10 times or more because it's just that amazingly delicious. Clint & Yoko are the best! It's a different dining experience since it's at their house with other people you may not know who purchased tickets for that date, but it's soo worth it! I've been to Japan so I am very picky about ramen, but they really perfect it. They put so much heart, time and passion into their cooking. It's about 4-6 dishes for about $50 +/- depending on which menu it is for the day. You have to check their site to see their available dates and purchase tickets. I've had a couple private events with 10 friends at their place and it's the best dinner! One of my favorite appetizers from here is their special deviled eggs and it is to die for. I am so glad they keep this on all their menus. I've tried majority of their ramen (paitan, shio, mazemen, shoyu, tan tan men, etc) and I cannot choose a favorite because theyre all just that good. Check it out and you won't be disappointed!,Such an incredible meal and experience. This ruined all other ramen for me because it's just not as good. All dishes were so well balanced in flavor and texture. Already can't wait to make my next reservation. Each dish was so intricate and crafted with so much care. Took my mom and we picked the Toto seats which means you sit on the couch and get to snuggle their lil poodle. She was great. Get tickets if you can.,Clint and his wife Yoko are just way too sweet, and their little puppy Toto!! They make you feel like home so much. This is the first time for me to have a family-style Japanese meal. The experience is just unforgettable. Clint has a very unique taste in ramen. I had the Yuzu Shio and it's SO DELICIOUS. Compared to other ramen, Clint's ramen makes you feel good -- the broth is so light, so natural, yet so rich. I could tell by the broth that he dedicates so much time on his ramen. Indeed, when I asked him about the broth, he used 8+ hour just to make the soup base. Let me be clear that not only the ramen is good, but also other small dishes. I had the curry potatoes (SO GOOD THAT IT MAKES ME CRY), Japanese style avocado toast (as Clint names it -- instead of a slice of bread, it's nori. What's so special about it that it taste like bacon yet it's vegetarian), and pickled cucumber (so good so light). You just HAVE TO eat at Clint's or shame on you.I'll come back to try other ramen they offer. Already missing it after having it for less than a week.,True rating 4.5This was my first pop up restaurant, I found it on yelp and decided to give it a try. Chef Clint and his wife Yoko are amazing. They are very welcoming and makes you feel right at home! I appreciate their passion for cooking and they honestly put their heart and soul into it. Our menu was:Deviled Ramen Egg: Delicious, it had such great flavor. Take it in one bite, full of happiness :)Tsukemono with Daikon: Refreshing. Yoko sliced the cucumbers 50 times, amazing hard work!Ta-konomiyaki: Instead of takoyaki balls, it's a pancake. This homemade dish was amazing, tasted like the ones in Japan!Chicken Paitan Ramen: Pretty good. Egg porn was real. Noodles were chewy. The broth I felt can have a bit more flavor. But overall delicious and definitely not filled with msg, very homemade.Garlic Chive Gomaae:This dish looks simple, but the flavors will blow your mind! Refreshing!Japanese Pudding: Light and a great finish to the meal sprinkled with matcha graham crackers! Overall, I had a great experience and made respect for Chef Clint and his wife. Keep up the good work!,I found out about this ramen pop-up from a friends visit. It's run out of the creators' home, and you will feel welcomed into their home. The food is delicious and unlike anything else in the Bay Area. The small dishes were wonderful and complex in flavor (ramen deviled egg, pickled cucumbers, curry potatoes, avocado nori toast) and the yuzu shio was amazing. We'll be back for the mazemen and other ramens!,Came here yesterday for Clint and Yoko's first Ma-za-men Brunch 'n Lunch and my friends and I absolutely loved the food and experience. For $44 we got 6 dishes, but the 5 stars here is for their dry ramen and service. I went to Japan last year and my favorite ramen place is called Nagi in Golden Gai. The ramen there is made with large amounts of dried sardines giving the broth a very bold and umami flavor. When I walked over to watch Yoko prepare the bowls of ramen, it instantly transported me back to Nagi. Clint's Ma-ze-men uses fish powder giving the ramen the same distinctive, bold flavor I had in Tokyo. This was my first time trying dry ramen and I think I prefer it over soup ramen. It puts the focus on the noodles and brings out all the flavors and textures Clint is able to mix in (fried chicken skin in my ramen?! YES). Aside from the food, Clint and Yoko are incredibly friendly and talked to everyone who attended the pop-up. It's also BYOB which is also a huge plus. I'm definitely coming back for their soup ramen.,Clint and his wife Yoko really captured the essence of Japanese cuisine while adding a Californian flair in their meal. Each ingredient is prepared with care and consideration and added to a dish to balance other flavors and textures -- crunchy, savory, sweet, soft. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The shio ramen my partner and I had the pleasure of feasting on was unlike any I've ever had in the Bay Area. The broth was light but had so much depth in flavor (a mix of dashi and chicken stock that took the chefs 3 days to make!). The slices of pork shoulder were tender and cooked to perfection (in a sous vide, none the less). The bits of fresh onion and yuzu added crunch and freshness that rounded out this well-balanced bowl of ramen. I am not embarassed to say that there was not a single morsel of food or drop of broth left in my bowl when I was done -- you will understand when you try and taste for yourself. Clint and Yoko's passion for creating and sharing real, authentic ramen is apparent and contagious. It was not only a delicious meal, but a once-in-a-lifetime food sharing experience. Thank you so much, Clint and Yoko!!!,Another amazing ramen pop upDinner at Feastly HQ prepared by Chef Clint and his wife Yoko! All ingredients are so unique and painstakingly prepared, some of them are only available in Japan. I never thought I would love ramen in light broth until this  Clint shared many interesting stories about their food adventures in Japan and explained in details about the thinking and making process behind every single component of the dish. It is amazing to get this level of insight from the chef!,This review is for their Feastly event, I attended at their home in Daly City. Definitely book a reservation, and go with some friends to make it more fun!Clint and Yoko were so friendly and amazingly sweet. They're really honest about their experiences and what food to them should be like. We came as a party of four, their house fits about 10-12? It was a little weird/awkward at first but by the time we're half way through, you get more social and make new friends!I wish I could remember everything we ate but....the deviled ramen egg- SO fun and great take on deviled egg/ramen, it was yummy. arugula salad and kushiage? fried pork belly- not greasy at all!! I could have eaten easily all of it...maybe, but the salad as well! I forgot what was in the dressing but I can eat salad everyday if I had that dressing!pickled celery?- very light and refreshing but! careful of the peppercorn, I thought it was chili and bit into it, BLEHHHH bad aftertaste hahaone other appetizer before the ramen, but I can't remember what it was exactly, but it was on seaweed, had some sort of cream cheese? mushroom? and tasted good as well.yuzu shio ramen! I love yuzu!!! so i was quite excited. Just like Clint, shio ramen is not my favorite either, but his flavors worked really well. dessert was amazing as well, yuzu honey froyo, strawberry and matcha crumble! I didn't think we were going to be full, but we left super satisfied, actually we didn't even leave right after, we chatted for almost an extra hour! My husband is a chef as well, so they had so much to talk about. summary, do go to an event if you see one! I think this month they have DUCK RAMEN, or foie gras something!! wish we could go as well, but our schedule is packed this month. Our friends are actually going again, so definitely worth checking out!!We still owe Clint and Yoko some green curry ;),Noodle in a Haystack is the best ramen experience in the Bay area, hands down. Clint and Yoko, who run the pop-up, painstakingly create a multi-course experience with a series of small plates that build-up to the main event - a mind-blowing bowl of ramen. And then, of course, there is the dessert, which is simple, yet elegant and delicious.I've been a few times now, and each time it's a unique experience with variety in the small dishes, the different types of ramens, and in the people in attendance. Every visit is unique.Some of my favorite small dishes have been the curry poutine, deviled ramen eggs, fried pork belly, and, shockingly," the salad. I say """"shockingly"""" because on the surface", it looks like a simple salad of mixed greens. But in reality, the dressing contains a ton of vegetables, which are blended with a traditional Japanese sesame dressing flavor profile. The flavors and textures elevate it far beyond a simple dressing. In terms of the ramen, so far, I've had the Tan-tan, Paitan, and Shio. I don't think I could pick a favorite. The tan-tan had a complex and balanced sweet, savory, spicy flavor. It's texture was creamy, almost like carbonara, from the poached egg. The paitan was rich and complex, with the perfect texture of smooth creaminess, without being oily or too thick. The shio was a delicate and heart-warming bowl of ramen. It has sansho pepper and yuzu, which help lighten up the bowl and make it pop. The communal aspect of the pop-up is part of what really sets it apart. Clint and Yoko treat you like family when you're there. They share about their experiences in Japan, and in running their pop-up. I've learned a lot about what goes into their process, which they are completely open about. On top of that, each dish in the multi-course experience has a story they share. They are down to earth and friendly, and their dog Toto, is amazing.Beyond the amazing hosts, you sit at a shared table with ~8-10 other people, who you get to share the meal with. I've met some wonderful people during my visits, and thoroughly enjoyed the conversations. I've even picked up some amazing food recommendations.,Such a phenomenal and delicious evening! Clint and Yoko are wonderful hosts - the maze tan-tan was ridiculously decadent and so interesting and filling! All the bites leading up to it (and with the adorable Toto cakes to finish!) were superb.  Truly a fantastic event which shows how thoughtful they are about every single element in each dish.  Keep trying for tickets - they're worth it. Thank you Clint Yoko and Toto!,We truly loved every bite at Clint & Yoko's home and argued the whole way home on which dish was best. It was exceptional value, too, considering we paid $80/person all in and had some of the best food we've had this year:-Their famous deviled egg-The softest tofu you'll ever eat in a broth with crab, uni (my favorite dish of the night)-The best pork belly...ever? with mixed greens-A pickle course ...again, really really fresh and delicious-Abura soba (a brothless ramen) that blew our minds-Yoko's take on dorayaki (chestnut flavored... no red bean). YUM.Loved our evening!,Absolutely the best ramen I have ever had. I live in Oakland but totally willing to drive to Daly City just to eat their ramen. And I love Toto, Clint and Yoko's poodle, their ramen mascot. :-),Definitely worth it. Thank you Clint and Yoko! A truly unique experience. Great food by kind people.,damn good ramen ! damn goodforgot what dish i got, but it was, you guessed it, damn good,Where to start? If I could give Noodle in a Haystack more than 5 stars, I would. This 6 course meal is beyond worth it. Everything we ate was so good. We started off with Japanese deviled eggs, Ta-konimiyaki, and marinated oysters with yuku and crispy rice. Each dish was filled with the perfect amount of flavor. They provided a light snack in between, Daikon and Pickled Cucumbers, cutting small slits into the cucumber so the pickle flavor would absorb. I was lucky to be able to try both of their ramen dishes, the Yuzu Shio Ramen and the Ma-ze-men dry ramen. Both were delicious, but I'm a soup kind of person, so the Yuzu Shio ramen won me over.  The chicken broth was light yet filled with so many different layers flavor. We ended our night with a Japanese Flan that was just the cherry on top. I loved that Clint and Yoko described each dish to us and explained their way of cooking. Our private event was held in their home, and they were extremely friendly and welcoming. I can't wait to have dinner here again soon!,I never been to Japan before so I can't compare their ramen to this, but this was amazing. Aburi Caesar Salad - Charred Romaine & Leeks, Burnt scallion-Miso-Caesar dressing, crispy anchovies. Delicious and so unique. I've never had charred romain lettuce before. I always want my salad like this. Takonomiyaki - a mix between takoyaki and okonomiyaki. Very yummy. Tsukemono - pickles to cleanse your palette. Yoko pickles it herself. So refreshing. Ma-ze-men (Dry Ramen) - , 3 day egg, pork belly,chicken skin cracklin, and a little bit of broth. So yummy! Chicken Paitan Ramen - Creamy 10 hr chicken bone broth & dashi, melt-in-mouth pork belly chashu, 3 day ramen egg and seaweed. This was so good also. I think I like this just a little itty bitty bit more than the dry ramen. Very reasonable price and everything is included. Make sure to check out their pop-ups. Clint and Yoko are such a nice couple. Also if you know them personally or know someone that knows them they do a private tasting at their house too. My husband doesn't eat seafood, so I asked if they can do more meat dishes and we will pay more. They did all of the above, but also sticky lotus which was delicious. The sauce was sweet and salty. The lotus was perfect texture with a bit of crunch. Also they did a tri tip with an amazing homemade teriyaki sauce. I'm not a fan of teriyaki sauce at all, but this was like the best thing ever. No wonder because they make it themselves and not bought from the store.,The best ramen in the Bay. This was so good, I felt like I transported to another realm while eating. And the appetizers of the carefully sliced radish pickles and ramen deviled eggs, so good. I highly highly recommend this meal!,Such an amazing experience. Super unique, would highly recommend. Cannot wait to tell everyone I know. Amazing couple too, so sweet and great hosts ;)!,The best ramen I've had in the bay area! We booked a dinner through Feastly (they're only a few days a week, with limited seatings). Every dish we had was amazing, a great take on japanese dishes. Most of them were conventional dishes like pickled cucumber and daikon but with a new take on flavors, and some were really cool fusions of dishes like tako-nomiyaki," a flatter version of takoyaki which cooled off quicker and had nicely spread out sauces. I had the Shoyu ramen and I""""m looking forward to coming back and trying other ramens!",From the deviled eggs to the several kinds of ramen to the pancake like dessert, this pop up is an incredibly creative and enjoyable dining experience. Hosts and chefs Clint and Yoko could not be more more gracious or more talented and dedicated in preparing their cuisine. It is not to be missed!,Craft ramen made with top notch ingredients and many unique flavors.  I've tried their chicken shio ramen, dipping mazemen ramen, and egg drop ramen.  You won't find these flavors at your average miso tonkatsu ramen shops.  Also with feastly you'll enjoy some few paired appetizers like deviled ramen eggs, pickled cucumbers, oysters and a really tasty potato dish.,Clint and Yoko create such a warm, intimate dining party with friends experience, if you had friends that make kickass Japanese food. Still dreaming of the super strong, slurpalicious chicken broth that's the base of their ramen.,Loved attending Noodle in a Haystack's supper club! Venue was elegant and minimalistic," and the chefs were extraordinarily welcoming and down to earth. Clinton gave a great introduction to each dish and the main course was perfect. Authentic and flavorful ramen without feeling greasy or weighed down. Love the set up - met some really great ppl from all walks. People even came alone and we all had a blast. Don't forget to BYOB/W!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Breadbelly,"Came here for breakfast on a weekend at about 10 or 10:30am, and luckily when we showed up there was no line! The line was down the block by the time it was 11am. There are also a little section of small tables right in front outside to enjoy your food.We ordered:- black sesame horchata (did not like it)- kaya bun- kaya toast- breakfast sandwich- chocolate croissantEverything was absolutely delicious, except the black sesame horchata. It wasn't for me and I didn't like the taste. Between the kaya bun and the kaya toast, I loved the toast even more. We also didn't expect much from the breakfast sandwich but it was really good!,This place gets lines on the weekend (but you can online order if you don't feel like waiting in the cold).I got there on a Sunday morning around 10/10:30 and beat the long line, only had 3 people in front of me.I was a little overwhelmed by the options, but my friend and I chose 5 items, and I had an egg coffee. We had a gyeranbbang, curry bun, lumpia, bakkwa, and a not-ube tart. The favorite was definitely the not-ube tart. My friend ordered 3 more after we ate ours! I prefer savory things, but the not-ube tart was definitely the one item that would make me come back here again and again. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because the prices are a little high for the size of the items you get. And they charge .75 for a bag btw. Would skip this next time.,The bread. That is what is sooooo amazing and special and standout about this small bakery. It is so thick, soft, and has a great bite. I am looking forward to going back to buy a loaf!!I highly recommend the kaya toast because you can really taste the pandan! This spot lives up to its high ratings and praise.,*3.5 stars* RIP my wallet lol. I finally tried breadbelly's famous kaya toast. Items here are quite pricey, but I thought the toast was worth every penny, especially if it's your first time trying it. The milk bread was so fluffy and the coconut-pandan jam wasn't too sweet. I also got the shrimpwich because I heard good things, but unfortunately, I didn't think that was worth the $22. I ended up giving half away to a friend. To drink, I got the 50/50, which was tasty because of the condensed milk, but really didn't turn out to be anything special when I could get a similar tasting vietnamese coffee for cheaper (and probably more caffeine). Parking was not too easy on a late Friday morning, but at least I was able to order online for pickup. They also make your drinks once you arrive to ensure they're fresh! Given the hype, I'd be interested in coming back to try additional pastries, and will update my rating accordingly.,I've always been a sucker for a good pastry shop, and I'd heard so much about this place. It's definitely a bit out of the way, and it's so cold here but it was definitely worth the trek. If you know you're coming here in advance, I'd recommend ordering online for pickup! There's usually a decent wait if you try to order in person.I got the kaya toast, breakfast sandwich and picked up a drink (I think it was seasonal since I don't see it on their menu anymore but it was a refreshing watermelon lychee tea). They're the most well known for their kaya toast and I knew that was a must try - it was really good and not too sweet as well as being just as aesthetic as it looked in pictures! Definitely doesn't compare to authentic singaporean kaya toast but this is a pretty good dupe. But the real standout for me was the breakfast sandwich. I actually almost ordered something else since it looked a little limp on the menu, but I'm so glad I went through with it. The sauces are the perfect mix of sweet and salty (I'm a sucker for sweet savory food) and the egg is so perfectly fried. Love that there's a little kale for health as well.Would definitely recommend coming if you're in the area. My only complaint is that they close so early! It's hard to plan a visit here unless you head out expecting to hit this first.,We came here on a Saturday around 11am and it was busy as usual. We ordered the breakfast sandwich, Kaya bun, and the Not Ube Tart.While the breakfast sandwich was delicious, hearty, and had a perfect balance of savory/salty flavors, it tasted like a typical breakfast sandwich; the fermented chili didn't stand out enough to make the sandwich Asian fusion, but it was still a solid breakfast sandwich.The Kaya bun had a nice Kaya flavor, but was a bit too sweet for me. I thought the topping would be similar to a pineapple bun crust, but it was more on the sticky side. The Not Ube Tart was probably my favorite of the three. It wasn't too sweet, and the salted egg yolk shavings cut through the creaminess of the ube very nicely.,The Kaya toast is worth all the hype. Great soft bread and nicely sweetened topping. I love how cartoonish and simple it is. I've never had egg coffee so we ordered it for fun. It was surprisingly yummy. Very unique. The cottage cheese, pomegranate seed, and zaatar pastry was a special - not sure if it's on the reg menu. I'm normally not a cottage cheese person but I'm so glad I got it cuz it was good. Staff was friendly and kind even tho we showed up pretty close to their closing time.,Yummy, unique breakfast. But pretty overpriced.We came around 10 am on a Sunday and saw a short line at the restaurant. I got the fig flan, my friend got the curry bun, and we split the kaya toast since we heard it's a bit heavy.All were really good! The fig flan sits in a bath of fig, ice, milk, and almonds (?). It was super refreshing, but I wish the menu/the cashier explained more of what it was. I didn't realize it was soaked in milk and since I'm lactose-intolerant (and can handle some amounts of dairy but not milk), I wish I'd known. My friend's curry bun was pretty good too with great spices and flavor.The kaya toast was heavy and filling, but good. Pretty sweet so it'd probably taste good with a coffee. Super creamy kaya on top of the thick, slightly crispy warmed toast. Overall, loved the atmosphere of the outdoor seating at the restaurant. Great way to spend a weekend morning! It was just very overpriced for what it was.,One of my favorite bakeries in SF. The kaya toast is a must!! I dream of this often. Crispy buttery bread topped with sweet kaya spread and sprinkled with flaky salt - pure perfection. They also offer a variety of other pastries, sandwiches and an ever changing drink menu. The service is fantastic and ordering is quick. Once you order, you can sit and enjoy the outdoor seating or take it to go. Always a bustling spot, come enjoy their delicious menu and soak in some sun (or bay area fog).,Came here on a Saturday morning w my boyfriend to get some coffee - we should've gotten some food because it would've been a more accurate representation of the place tbhLike many SF shops now, you order at the window and there's seating outside (about 10 tables). Their menu is really unique and features a lot of Asian flavors, which is probably why it's attracted a lot of attention. The cashier was friendly and we ordered the egg coffee and black sesame horchata. The egg coffee is a rendition of the Vietnamese egg coffee. It was pretty good at first, but the espresso shot at the bottom was actually burnt and sour. The black sesame horchata was really good, but the entire cup was filled with ice - even when we finished the drink. While the flavors and efforts were there, the execution definitely needs some work. The drinks were very overpriced and the food seems overpriced as well for the amount you get. If you want to come for the coffee/drinks, I would pass. However, the food seems popular and may live up to the hype.,OK. So after reading some reviews, I have wanted to try this place for almost a year now. I made time to head over during a trip to the Academy of Sciences and I'm happy I did! The staff was so helpful answering questions, and our order was packed up quickly. The parking on the weekend during lunch was rough, though we eventually found street parking a block away.I tried the curry bun. A generous curry with chunky veggies and maybe toasted pine nuts on the top. I tried it room temp, but a little time in the air fryer or broiler would have elevated it to the next level!My son had the kaya bun. The topping texture was similar to a HK pineapple bun but pandan flavor/color and the pandan custard filling was rich with lots of pandan flavor, yum!The butter mochi was good, but not quite what we were expecting and had a strong peanut butter taste. My daughter was craving Hawaiian style butter mochi and I think it wasn't what she had her heart set on. Finally the banana cake was tasty with semisweet chocolate chips and a hint of banana flavor. Only wishing it was a little more balanced with less chocolate so as to not mask the banana flavor. I didn't see the other menu on the wall, so we will definitely be back in the future to try more items, and compare their kaya toast with my homemade version!,The concept is lovely the execution of pastries are top notch.  However, I felt their star ""Pandan Toast"" was too sweet for me and for $10 seemed a little expensive for my taste. I think if you have a little sweet tooth, then head over there with a friend.  It's has great ambience. I enjoyed they had a lovely assortment of herbal teas. The black sesame cookie was light, and flakey. Presentation and packaging do get a 10, so if you are looking to wow people on Insta or TikTok, yeah, this is the place!,Came here and was super stoked to try out breadbelly. I love kaya toast so you know we had to get an order. I was kind of shocked at the price point, almost $10 for a kaya toast, but i guess that's SF pricing for you. The toast was toasted, but really soft on the inside, not really crispy or crunchy (was looking for that) There was A LOT of spread over the toast. It was really good, sweet yet mild flavor profile. Some bites were salty due to sea salt flakes on top which was a nice touch. But the bread could have been toasted better. It definitely felt like a twist on kaya toast and not that original flavor of kaya i always tasted. We also got a sesame horchata, very good! I really liked it, was perfect balance of sweet and sesame flavor. Overall, i want to give it a 3.5 but if pricing a sliced toast at $10, i'd rather go elsewhere, it was great to try one time though!,Overall, I was satisfied with my experience at Breadbelly. I was pleasantly surprised to find street parking on a busy Sunday morning in San Francisco. The service was quick and efficient when we first arrived at 10:00am, although it did get a bit slower as the restaurant got more crowded. Thankfully at the time we arrived, there was plenty of outdoor seating available. After about 45 minutes, the outdoor seating started filling up.The standout dish for me was the kaya toast - it was flavorful, delicious and definitely worth trying. It even looked beautiful! The curry bun was okay, but not as impressive. The egg coffee was a unique drink and the egg foam was interesting, but the espresso was too bitter for my taste and overall the drink was pretty small. Note that the food and drinks here are more on the expensive side. Despite the wait for our food, I would still recommend giving Breadbelly a try for the kaya toast.,Love the unique and asian inspired pastries and desserts here! My friends and I specifically wanted to try the kaya toast, and it did not disappoint: the milk bread was thick and buttery while the kaya jam was super fragrant -- the sprinkle of salt on top also made a huge difference! Only reason I took a star off was that the prices are up there and the wait can get long; the drinks were delicious but were around $7-8 for a 12oz!!,Not sure how I have not been here before - Guessing maybe because I live within 10 blocks of 3 other stellar french SF bakeries (B. Patissiere, Arsicault, &Boulangerie), so why venture any further out.  I would say I have been to 95% of all the other well known bakeries in the city.  And - just know that if you live in SF, you are quite spoiled.  I have another home in Dallas and guess what?, I have-not found even one bakery to even slightly rival the top 20 SF bakeries, not one. (BBQ sure, it has SF beat by a mile, but bakeries, no contest.)Today may have been destiny. It was a rainy Sunday and there was no line. It was difficult to choose what to get, but they do have a platter that the cashier will show you in order to help make a choice.I ordered the Black sesame sausage croissant.  Sadly I did not love it, the sausage was too garlicky and just not a texture that I enjoyed.  The other croissant was a ""weekend special"" and might have been the most decadent croissant I have ever had, and also one of the best. It was a ""plum, twice baked croissant with almond/orange frangipane and plum jam"". (Topped sorta ""crumb cake"" style) -- WOW.  It was incredible, really and truly. So incredible in fact, I am not sure I can go back here knowing it was a ""special"" and they may never have it again. I guess, just note to self - go sweet, nit savory.Thrilled that I spoiled myself today, and found something one-of-a-kind.,Great bakery in the Richmond District.I've been here a few times and they have alot of good options and a big menu for food and drinks.My usual order is the kaya toast, kaya bun and then the milk loaf for to-go to eat during the week. My friend tried the char siu sando and the ginger yuzu drink. Their bread quality is great, so fresh! The sando was also good, not heavy on the tummy and refreshing. My friend also enjoyed his sparkling ginger yuzu drink, perfect amount of sweetness.Ordering is very convenient, you can scan a QR code and order online and they give you an eta for pick up time. Definitely a staple bakery!,I've heard a lot of good things about Breadbelly from friends and finally came around to trying it this past weekend! I tried their not ube tart, egg salad sandwich and their watermelon lychee tea. I enjoyed everything, though next time I would only reorder the ube tart. The egg salad sandwich kinda reminded me of Eggslut in terms of the aesthetic. The buns had a nice crisp, the egg salad was complemented well with lettuce and a type of fried potato(?). The ube tart wasn't too sweet and had a nice crust, topped with some type of savory shavings. The watermelon lychee tea sounds better than it tastes - pretty much just tasted like watermelon juice. Would pass on this especially since it was $7.50.I'm excited to come back and try their other pastries and drinks, likely their Kaya toast and bun.,Uhh... the order ahead menu is more limited compared to the actual menu when you order at the store. Why penalize the people who had the foresight to order ahead?! Not cool.,Yum! Love this place. Although it just looks like a little cafe, this place serves up some amazing memorable dishes. All of their pastries are made in house. Their croissants are flaky and so delicious. The bratwurst was so good. Juicy on the inside w/ intense flavor & unique herbs like rau ram. I came here for the shrimp sandwich. The perfectly battered that thing & the aioli on it was divine.Also got the chicken karaage. So crispy and juicy.Salivating all over again and will come back soon.,Came here for a brunch/lunch around 11 am on a Saturday and service was pretty fast and food was a 5/5! Super unique flavors and fun menu items- I got the Breakfast sandwich which was one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've had. Perfect balance between the crispy egg (runny yolk!), spicy sauce smeared on the bun, fresh lettuce, tender ham, and cooked greens! Also got the matcha cappuccino and almond jam cookies, and here's my gripe (and why I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars): the cookies were $4.25 for these two little cookies and the matcha cappuccino was $6 or $7 for a tiny cup. For these prices, I think I wish the size was communicated a bit better before purchase (like on the menu, the drink listed in ounces or the number of cookies more on display). I have yet to try the cookies but I'm hopeful they're yummy!,Came with a lot of hype and didn't live up to it. No indoor dining, but a handful of outdoor tables. Beautiful dishes but none of them particularly hit.Kaya Bun - 4/5. Great outer shell, soft milk bun. But the custard didn't cut through as I'd hoped.Curry Bun - 3/5. Squash base lacked flavor.Date n Pomegranate Bun - 3/5. Dominated by za'atar flavor.Blueberry Yuzu Poppyseed Twice Baked Croissant - 3/5. Sweet jammy filling that doesn't quite find its counterpoint.Apfelkuchen Croissant Tart - 1/5. Something went wrong. There was a burned, artificial flavor that resembled melted down plastic. Didn't eat it.,5/5 for incredible flavors, such light textures and truly beautiful works of art.As a bread lover, this is definitely one of my highlight bakeries that I've tried this past year. The Kaya toast had such an airy milk bread with a sweet but deep creamy overlay.The beef sandwich was filling with a nice little dipping broth. The black sesame cookie was soso, it was more caramel than expected. The texture was quite interesting.The other pastries just have such great flavors, their cheesecake is expensive but rich. The cookies it comes with are a great pairing to dip into the cake. Great for sharing, even the small piece or the full cake. Ultimately, a MUST try in the city!,Traveled 40+ minutes for the Kaya Toast and it was absolutely worth it. I arrived around 1:30pm on a Sunday, and there was only a short line. The bread was fluffy and the kaya jam was creamy and not overly sweet or oily despite the generous layer. However, the portion is quite large, so would recommend sharing with a friend or two - my friend only took a few bites and I struggled to finish the rest since the bread + jam combination can get a bit heavy. One star deducted for the price.... I wanted to try more items but my wallet was crying a little. The outdoor seating area can also get super windy, so come prepared!,Breadbelly is a brunch spot with Asian inspired baked goods, (fancy) hot dog, fried small bites, and unique drinks (like an egg coffee and sesame horchata). The selection is really well thought out and creative, and the flavors and textures meld really well. It's definitely worth a visit, but I probably will not return just because it is quite a pricey spot. Also note that the seating is outside ONLY. Lines are usually long, but moves fast. Parking is on the street, but it's not hard to find. It's a pick up your food and sit down kind of place. Come if you are willing to spend some money and are ok eating outside/no service! You definitely won't be disappointed in the food.,*3.5 stars, Came here on a sunny Saturday morning for brunch and line was ~15min long. No inside seating & bathroom available but there were plenty of tables outside that we were able to snag after we ordered. Got the egg coffee, Kaya Toast,Shrimp Sandwich,& Breakfast Sandwich, which came out within 10min of placing the order.**** 4/5 egg coffee - never had sweet egg (foam?)  mixed with espresso shot , tasted like an eggy coffee crepe brûlée. portion was a bit small, think 4oz for $6.25 *** 3/5 Kaya toast - the Kaya was creamy perfection but it was spread on top of burnt toast. pic holding up the toast shows how BLACK it was underneath the Kaya. There were 3 of us so each took a piece, we were starving and had already eaten half of it before realizing that it was burnt else would've taken it back. Do better if you're paying $9 for burnt toast!!*****5/5 shrimp sando - the bread was light & crunchy, pairing well with the tempura shrimp patty & tangy cole slaw. This was $22 well spent compared to the toast lol****4/5 breakfast sandwich - egg was runny in a will make the entire sandwich creamy way, the seaweed underneath was a pleasant surprise, very unique flavors!Overall menu was pricey and some items were a complete let down , nice to visit for sure but wouldn't warrant coming back.,I tried the strawberry balsamic danish and it was amazing! It was so fresh and tasty, the pastry was so fluffy and buttery as well. The ube tart was also delicious and it wasn't too sweet. I also got the 50/50 iced and it was also really good! There was a good balance between the coffee taste and sweetness of the drink.,Like all the other reviews below - the Kaya toast is so good! I decided to get it with the Gyeranbbang which was recommended by the staff there. They paired so well because one was sweet and the other savory!,I think my bestie outdid himself and took me to all the best pastry shops in SF, including Breadbelly! The kaya, and the kaya toast is a must. And if the curry bun is available, grab that too! Plenty of outdoor seating, but be prepared to spend about $25-$30. Pricey but damn well worth the price!!,If you are a pastry fan Breadbelly is  a great place to check out. We stopped by Breadbelly for some pastries and coffee before our hike yesterday. For the patries we ordered Kaya Bun, Blueberry Almond Croissant Tart and Rhubarb Lychee Danish. Looks like the Kaya Bun is their regular while Blueberry Almond Croissant Tart and Rhubarb Lychee Danish is only there for the day. They definitely have interesting texture and flavor but I am not blown away.KAYA BUN (5/5):  This is definitely my favorite one. The coconut pandan cream filling was so creamy and I loved the crunchiness of the topping cookie.BLUEBERRY CROISSANT TART (3.5/5): The croissant tart was very buttery which I like. However the blueberry topping was too much makes the croissant a bit too tart and the breading is a bit hard. Would be perfect if the breading was softer and there was a bit less blueberry on top.RHUBARB LYCHEE DANISH (3.5/5): The breading, again, was a bit hard and there was too much tart flavor. However, I liked how there was some sesame in the breadingOverall, I would say that I am not a huge fan but I will come back to try new pastries/ flavors.,If I lived in Richmond... I would come here everyday. Take my money Breadbelly!! This place was so unique and delicious! I loved their fun drink choices and their seemingly endless list of pastries. I would have loved to try every single thing on their menu, but unfortunately we got there after noon, so many of the menu items were already sold out. :( so I would definitely recommend coming earlier rather than later if there's something in particular that you would like to try!! We ended up getting the kaya toast, the breakfast sandwich, chicken karaage, and Gyeranbbang. It took a while for the food to come out, but it was pretty busy so that was understandable. I'd probably order ahead next time though. We sat outside since indoor seating was not offered. The tables were kinda tiny, but the vibes were still great. :)Food: The kaya toast was soo good (I've never had anything like it before!), and the breakfast sandwich was a lil spicy but so TASTY. The bread in these two items was so soft and perfect. The chicken karaage was good but pretty standard, and the Gyeranbbang didn't really stand out to me either. We also tried 4 drinks: the sesame horchata, 50/50, egg coffee, and the seasonal lassi. The sesame horchata was good, but very heavy on the sesame. I don't think I would get it again. The lassi was very strong in its yogurt flavor, so it was also not my favorite. The egg coffee was good and unique, and the 50/50 was yummy --it tasted like a mix of black tea and Vietnamese coffee. In the future, I'll probably stick to getting normal coffee, but it was fun getting to try these drinks!Next time I'm in Richmond I will definitely be back to try alllll the different pastries!! Looking forward to coming back :),Bread in my belllllllyyyyy!! Definitely worth trying the kaya toast! Star of the show for sure. However, can't justify the price here, so minus 1 star for that. *kaya toast DELICIOUS. If there's anything you MUST try it's this!! *curry toast Smelled GREAT, but the flavor was a little lacking. It made me crave savory a little more like there was more to be desired. *butter mochi This was yummy! But there's peanut in case there's anyone there with allergies. *watermelon lychee tea Predominantly watermelon flavor, but for enough who likes lychee black tea, this was good. *blueberry lassi I personally didn't like this as much, but my bf says ""it's what I would expect from a lassi"" Only in SF would I spend around $40 for pastries and drinks. But for sure try the kaya toast!! Cute seating outside.,I've seen the check-ins and photos on Yelp and I couldn't stand it any longer: We had to try Breadbelly!Ordering online is the way to go. You can choose the time and it'll be ready and when you arrive then they'll make your drinks.My always-eating teenage foodie son chose the breakfast sandwich ($12). About halfway through, he got a taste of the pepper paste and urgently said, ""put the straw in my drink now now!!"" while fanning his mouth. Luckily I ordered him a date and orange blossom lassi ($7.50) to put out the fire! I splurged with the Shrimpwich ($22) and my mouth waters when thinking about the crispy goodness biting into a solid shrimp patty. With shredded lettuce and an avocado spread, every bite was perfectly balanced and delicious. My iced coffee was pretty good, sesame cookie my son said he ""looooved it"". I thought the price was a bit steep ($4.75).Unique food, quality ingredients, ease of ordering, gracious service and a parklet to sit, Breadbelly is a new favorite.,9.50 for the sesame raspberry croissant.  Yes, lots of raspberries inside.  Is it worth it? If you have money, yes.  If you like raspberries, yes.  But ultimately will you spend that kind of money? I was more focused on the sesame which was not much.  I guess i misread.  I thought there was grounded sesame inside, which wasn't.,We love this place for its unique flavor and special seasonal croissants. Always delicious, fresh and great customer service! Definitely will be back.,Long lines.Outdoor seating only.Order at the door.-----As per usual, whenever I get excited about anything (especially food and dessert), I order everything on the menu to try. So that's exactly what I did. Everything was delicious ... the kaya bun, sesame croissant, sesame cookie, double baked croissant, banana bread, etc. But the standout was the Mt. Tam basque cheesecake. Thick, creamy, flavorful. I couldn't finish the slice in one sitting since it's so heavy, but I was happy I had some leftover later to eat.I wouldn't really recommend the matcha drink -- small and very matcha-powdery. My friend liked the egg coffee, it reminded her of a hot affogato since the egg foam makes it creamy.,Haven't been here since CoVID pandemic and boy has things changed (talking about the prices ). loved what they did with the outside seating. It is nicely put together and spacious. Makes me want to linger around especially on a nice day out. parking is still easy for me, both metered and residential parking available. Order at the door entrance. Only outside dinning for now. will call your name when order is ready. Their $9 Kaya toast 5/5 is the best. it is a must get and must be eaten freshly toasted. love their pillow fluffy milk bread. prices has gone up but inflation happening everywhere. $14 Bellydog is another bomb . i was sad when it was eaten up. the bun bread is a little tad soft for the hot dog though. No matter, very tasty and has a kick to it. 5/5 their $7.25 Sparkling Yuzu Americano 3.5/5, the yuzu overpowers the espresso and lacks any coffee taste. sweetness level is just right. refreshing caffeine drink nevertheless. can't wait to come back to try their other menu items. i only have one stomach and can only fit so much in at a time.,Long wait was worth it! We tried the butter mochi, kaya bun, kaya toast, almond jam cookies and sesame horchata. My favorite was the butter mochi and kaya toast. The butter mochi had toasted nuts on the outside and the texture was the right amount of chewiness. Loved how the toast had so much kaya spread on top. I wish the kaya bun had more filling, mine was a lot of bread inside. All together, our breakfast was $40. Looking forward to trying their sandwiches next!,A B S O L U T E L YThis is F*CKING incredible. I love this place. I love the food here. The Kaya Bread would be able to solve world wars if everyone just sat down and ate that. That's how damn good this bread is lol.,Run don't walk here! This is such a cute Asian bakery with creative pastries that taste amazing! We came here on a Sunday around 12 pm and there was already a bit of a wait outside. There is a good amount of seating outdoors as well and your should be able to nab a spot (but bring a jacket since it can get chilly). We shared the kaya toast and the not ube tart. The kaya toast bread was so buttery and paired nicely with the sauce on top that tastes like condensed coconut milk. The ube tart is true to its naming and tastes like purple sweet potato but the torches cream and salted egg yolk shavings on the top really elevate it to another level. Next time I want to come earlier to try their lychee pastry!,Literally everything on the menu is amazing. You can't go wrong with what you order. -Sparkling yuzu americano: so unique and yummy.-Kaya toast: what they're known for and the reason why I came. I haven't had one since singapore and this was so good!-Kaya bun: sweeter than the kaya toast. The toast is more savory and this one is more of a sweet KAYA pastry. Also delicious!-Kakiage egg salad bunwich: sooo so good. The flavor is 10/10 and the crispy tempura pieces in the sandwich make the texture amazing.We arrived on a Sunday around noon and we ordered right away at the window and the items came out quickly. There is only outdoor seating right now.,This place is definitely worth the hype! They are still doing outdoor seating only, so we weathered the cold and ate at one of the tables. We ordered a Kaya Bun, a Good Morning Bun, Curry Toast, and a couple of oat milk lattes. The buns were delicious and a good size. I highly recommend trying the Kaya Bun as the filling had a yummy kaya flavor that was sweet and coconuty. The Curry Toast had such a nice savory taste that was balanced well with the veggies and egg topping it. Great place to try some interesting and yummy treats!,HYPE IS REAL! I was so excited to try this place -- really unique menu with interesting flavors. UBE TART -- This was my favorite!! Satisfying creamy ube bite with meringue cream. So good. So memorable. Black sesame alfajores -- This was a super soft delicate buttery cookie packed with black sesame flavor. Addicting. Egg Bread -- Would have been better if served warm! Only order this if you're doing takeout. It was cold. It was way better microwaved a bit. Super cheesy.Matcha Cappuccino ---This was just ok! It's also TINY, a cappuccino at a bougie latte price. But ya you need a drink of some sort to eat these pastries.They have outdoor seating but it's just sidewalk seating and quite packed. I ate in the car haha.,I never believed in a love worth changing everything about yourself they always tell you about. At least not until today.It was one of those usual days of popping by the bakery in the hopes of reclaiming some ounce of joy that had been lost throughout a grueling week of bad news and even worse decisions. To think that we've fallen to the point of relying on little treats just to feel alive again. Oh, how far we've strayed from the light. We're pathetic social creatures of habit. Frequenting the establishments that give us a kind of comfort we can't find anywhere else, yet too scared to even try anything new. How self-centered filth we are--thinking that by repeating the same thing over and over again, that someday something just significant enough could happen and shake it all up so we finally have a reason to leave it all behind.Just also happened to be one of those days where something goes slightly wrong, so you walk down a new path because there's a piece of dog shit you just don't have the energy to deal with today. So there I am, strolling down the road in a heightened fight or flight. Anyone could jump you so you always gotta have your guard up. Solved enough cases around these parts to know which family's turf just by the smell of the trash in the vicinity. Today's scent was unlike any other I've encountered though. It drew me in like a spellbinding allure and before I know it, I'm at the storefront of a place I've never been before. What brought me here? How long was I out for? ""One Kaya Toast, please."" ""Sure thing,"" the clerk says, ""we'll call your number when it's ready.""I take a seat in the makeshift outdoor dining area. Get your act togeth",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"r! This isn't time to relax and have a picnic! But it's too late and I've already lost all control. This spell has had a firm grasp on me from long before and I can't get out.""""Order 77"," your toast is ready!"""" A piece of bread with a delicately decorated coating is lain before me. It stares at me with a luscious gaze. The refractions of light on its surface blind me to its true intent. I can't really see under the winding green trails either--I can only guess it has plans for me that I can't even fathom.Then the toast speaks. """"I've been waiting for you for a long time"," little one. You have no power here.""""I frantically turn around to see if anyone else is reacting and the space is now empty. It's only me and this toast in a dark vacuum", frozen in some heavy shadowy realm of another dimension. I've lost track of who I am. My purpose, feelings, memories--semblances of my being all fragments now.I can't speak, only surrender to the sheer presence of this toast. The constant beat of my heart resounding through the silence and only becoming harder, faster," and louder. What will it do with me?""""I've always loved you."""" the toast confesses"," now blushing and looking up to me. """"Ever since I first saw you... I dreamed of us being together forever!"""" """"I-I don't know what to say. I've never had this happen to me before."""" I stammer"," putting the few words I can muster in this confusion. """"Forget about all the other toasts. You have me and only me now."""" I can't resist and now the toast has me up against the wall. Its long"," sturdy frame hovering over me. Flakes of coarse salt and buttery crumbs falling onto me. A piece lands onto my lips and I instinctively lick it off. The sensation sends a reverberating shock throughout my spine and my knees weaken. The toast leans in close to my neck. I can't help but breathe more heavily. Time slows down and our inhales and exhales sync into a familiar rhythm.""""Ahn~""""A milky aroma fills the space between us. All I can feel now is the soft touch of the toast gently entering my mouth. I'm caressed by a divine velvet that melts upon the warmth of my saliva. The taste of sweet nectar swirls around the tongue and bits of salt dances upon the tastebuds. I've never known such a sublime taste and texture before. I'm lost in a whirlpool of sensations and nothing else matters anymore.Then I swallow and I feel the toast's loving touch inside of me. It molds to my body--as if it was meant to be there and only there. I will never forget it. That satisfaction of consuming something so beautiful and so precious"," only for it to belong to me and only me. The tension leaves my body and I can let go of all the walls I had built up to this moment. """"Mmmmmm...""""I feel a little dirty", but accomplished and loved and cherished.,Ive passed by this place many times and every time there are so many people! I finally timed it right and got there right when it opened and there was still a line, BUT the line moves pretty quick in my opinion. Or maybe it just takes me a very long time to decide what I want since everything looks so good! I knew I had made a huge mistake the moment I took my first bite because before I knew it, I was back two more times within a week! Though the prices are on the higher end (SF prices!), I felt like it was worth paying for quality baked goods. So far, Ive tried the kaya toast, kaya bun, everything bun, the gyeranbbang, and 50/50. Everything was amazing and I can't wait to try more things!,Everything we order was amazingly delicious ! The kaya cream uses both in the bun and top of the toast is the best I've had so far( can't compared to couple I've tried while vacationing in Singapore ) ! Love the chocolate miso combo on the cake Definetly be back when I'm in the bay area,All I can say is wow. Everything was SO good. My boyfriend and I both got the beefwich with the soup on the side. The meat was so tender and flavorful and the jicama added the perfect crunch. The broth had a rich beef flavor and paired perfectly with the sandwich. I also got a sesame horchata which was incredible.  We also shared the kaya toast and loved it. Definitely have to come back to try the kaya bun and their other specials!,I MEAN GET IN MY BELLY AMIRIGHT HAHAHAi'm thankful and proud to support an aapi owned business who makes unique and delicious food and drinks. i love how their menu caters to both coffee/non coffee drinkers and the very expansive food options that range from a whole meal to just pastries on the go. the service is good, the wait time was even better, it's pretty fast and presentation is always beautiful. i've gotten their shrimpwich twice now and i love it every time. even half of wich is SOOO filling so i'm blessed. their drinks were delicious. the grape +black currant lassi,,,omg i really loved it. pass on the basque cheesecake. it's fine but there's nothing really special about it. but i'm dinging for the price and seating setup. the shrimpwich was $20.. that's really really pricey for a sandwich, yes i understand with inflation and all but yeah, it was a tough card swipe for the wich. they only have outdoor seating and it's only like six tables with no sort of shading or covering when maybe it's either sunny or raining. i hope they can find a better location or open up for indoor cus their seating in general is lowkey depressing. not a place i'd come frequently but a place i'd stop by every so often.,Got the Kaya toast and Breakfast sandwich.So the Kaya toast was pretty tasty, nothing like the Kaya toast I get from Singapore in that the bread is soft and the Kaya jam isn't really a jam. BUT it tasted great.Breakfast sandwich was decent, hard to go wrong with one. The staff are lovely. The price of my two pieces were ok but some of the other menu items reaaaally stretch the wallet more than expected.,Cute pastry and sandwich shop gem located in Richmond! Everything here is so delicious, and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. My friends and I stopped by to pick up some goodies to fuel our hike by a beach, and enjoyed these sandwiches - can confirm they still taste good cold! Everything here is a mix of Japanese/Asian/American which is pretty much all the cuisines I love stuffed in a bakery. Not the ube tart - don't know why it's called this but it's definitely ube!! You're gonna need a knife to cut into this one- the cream and the ube is so thicccc and sweet you're gonna want to get seconds. Kakiage egg salad bunwich: has some fried goodies, egg salad was flavorful, bread was toasted to perfection. Waited a bit to bite into this but the fried parts remained crispy and not soggy! Only wish is I tried this while it was freshly made and hot, but it was still amazing! Will be back to try more things on the menu. Outdoor seating is available and can get packed on a weekend but the line goes pretty fast!,Breadbelly is so tasty. I love closeby and am always tempted to order. I really like their black sesame horchata, Not Ube tart, chicken karaage, and their kaya bun :),Still drooling over this. Best thing I've eaten in a while. It's sweet but a little salty on top. The milk bread is grilled to perfection. Obsessed with this place.,OMG if only I lived in the Richmond district of San Francisco. I would come to Breadbelly every single day. We had so many delicious things for our lunch take out. I adored their pea salad. The cornbread with the egg was so unique and delicious. I could not get enough of the egg salad sandwich. The smashed potatoes they had were to die for. The guys loved the chicken bites. The only thing I despised was the curry toast. I think the taste of the sweet delicate milk bread was lost by the pile of strong flavors. I ended up taking the stuff of the milk bread and just eating the bread which was divine! I can't wait to go there again. So delicious!,Cute parklet.Severely overpriced.They served me a cold, hard, croissant. The breakfast sandwich is very good, though.Would I come back? Absolutely not. There are far better, and more reasonably priced establishments in the neighborhood.,We went around 11am on a Sunday and had to wait in a decent line. They have a cute outdoor seating area and that was packed, but luckily a seat was open after we finished ordering. We got the breakfast sandwich and the kaya toast, both were so tasty! The kaya toast was very fluffy and pretty. It's even glistening in the picture. I would definitely go back for the toast and to try their other pastries!,The food here was OK. We got two drinks, hot dog, breakfast sandwich, and kaya bun. Breakfast sandwich was the bestThe flavor was weak on everything. A little expensive- which i would be fine with if there was better flavor!,There's plenty of outdoor seating but make sure to come here on the weekends as it's quite busy.Everything bun - the onion jam and cream cheese center was surrounded by sesame seeds, poppy seeds, and onion bits. Upon my first bite, the bun was a little bland and dry. The bun was much better when I got to the center. I loved the onion jam as it had onion strips. Kaya bun - must get! A fluffy milk bread filled with kaya cream. It has the crackly topping that's found in pineapple buns. Definitely eat this with the box underneath to catch the topping as it crumbles easily. The topping surprisingly didn't have much flavor. The kaya cream was very good but a little bit sweet for me.Overall, it's a good bakery but on the pricier side.,This is my third consecutive weekend at Breadbelly and I have no complaints. There are tons of pricey bakeries in SF but this one actually deserves your money! Seriously everything is delicious but top recs are the Kaya Bun (for sweet) and the Beefwich (for savory). The Beefwich is pho in a sandwich; it's Asian birria; it's french dip but better. I can't recommend it enough.If you're worried about losing all your money to this place (like I am) I think you can try each drink once then never again as they are $$$ at $8.,Preorder online first thing in the morning if you want the bread!  I wasn't sure if I could make it to their short opening window so when I checked online at 1pm everything is gone! Drinks are available but it's very pricey! I ordered the egg coffee to try since it looks special. Apparently online order didn't mean anything as I got there and they said they had my order and will make it fresh for me. So I had to still wait. Luckily it's not a long wait. It's a very small cup for that price! The egg fluff on top is tasty, but after I finished the top the coffee at the bottom isn't great.  I should maybe mix the whole thing and drink it but there's not enough egg fluff to go around. They give you a spoon to eat it.They have a small amount of outdoor seating and you cannot go into the store at all. They only open  10-2.,I rarely make it out to this neighborhood but Breadbelly was worth it. Their pastries are fluffy, flaky, with super unique flavors.Kaya bun - one of their best sellers, matcha flavored with custard inside. You HAVE to get this.Blueberry bun - decent but not so special that I would order it again.I knocked one star because I would have expected it to be warm given they're all made day of and in a limited quantity. But definitely a must try!,Stopped by on a Friday at 11:15 am and a good number of their menu items were already sold out (probably partially because people placed online orders), so be sure to get here right at opening if you're looking to purchase a particular item! Nonetheless we got the two items we were eyeing. Both the kaya toast and char siu sando exceeded our expectations! The char siu sando had pickles vegetables that help cut through the pork, and the bread was incredibly soft. The kaya toast had salt (?) flakes on top and had a sweet, creamy coconut flavor without being overdone. The toast was this magnificent pillow like bread that pairs so nicely with it. Definitely recommend if you're in the area!,It's pretty good, but also I'm confident I can pull together a tempura-ed stringed potato & egg brioche sandwich at home. I can cook this. So I can't qualify this as a full on brunch spot, Breadbelly is in the middle ground of brunch spot and pastry/ coffee shop.By the photos or my Christmas nails, you can tell I went on Christmas Eve.  I was a walk in, didn't have to order in advance, received my order in about 20 mins.,One of my absolute favorite places in the Richmond District, let alone all of San Francisco. Been going since day 1 for that kaya toast - i've been hooked. Wash it down with a 50/50 -  my favorite drink!! iced, 1/2 black coffee 1/2 tea w. condensed milk. Not too sweet and full of caffeine, right up my alley.Since then, i've tried so many things on the menu. All the pastries, the soup, the savories, the sweets, the cookies, the sandwiches....Breadbelly's char siu sandwich is consistently good and my all time favorite item. House made char siu with bok choy on fluffy Japanese milk bread. The last time I went to Breadbelly, I actually went 3 days in a row for brunch. There's usually a line, you can order ahead, and there are tables outdoors. I love the durian wallpaper in the restrooms!,Kaya toast ($8) is amazing. Didn't care for the other items I tried: shrimp sandwich, cornbread with egg, and chrysanthemum iced tea. I would say it's on the pricey side. The vibe is good. There's a nice outdoor seating area. Nice weekend hang out.,4.5 starsThe name Breadbelly is just the right descriptor for my belly! This bakery and cafe offers a menu of unique, creative Asian-inspired pastries and dishes that you won't find anywhere else. For example, the Kaya Bun was a milk bread bun containing a green filling of coconut and pandan custard, topped with a chewy," matcha-infused """"pineapple bread"""" crust. On the savory side", the Raclette n Mushroom Bun featured a filling of umami maitake mushrooms and smokey raclette cheese, along with roasted garlic, crushed nuts, and a honey glaze, which added a light, contrasting sweetness. One of my favorite items was the Breakfast Sandwich," built on a soft """"bunwich"""" and featuring a savory combination of smoked ham", gruyere, fried egg, cooked sweet and sour kale, and a fermented chili paste, a spicy concoction that dominated the flavor of the sandwich. Finally, the Char Siu Sando was a Japanese-inspired sandwich built on two slices of soft, chewy milk bread and containing a generous filling of sliced roast pork glazed with a sweet and savory char siu sauce, along with cucumber, lettuce, and scallions, which added a refreshing contrast to the fatty pork.,Breakfast Sandwich: Bursting with flavors and unexpected ingredients. A unique twist on an American classic, the breakfast sandwich. Featuring pickled collard greens and a spicy spread, like a mild sriracha. I thought it almost had a Japanese influence because at first I thought it was seaweed from the crunchy texture. The egg is fried in a way that keeps the yoke from exploding, which I personally like. Served on a poppy brioche. Yum!I bumped into a friend who recommended the Kaya toast. So I picked that up before leaving. Let me tell you, this chance moment bumping into a friend paid off. Kaya toast...it is outstanding! For the duration of the day," I could hear Bob Marley chanting """"Gotta have 'Kaya' now."""" And best of all", it's green! Served on a fluffy cloud of Texas toast, the spread is neon green and seasoned with a tiny bit of sea salt. This is a must. Your tongue can thank me later. Anyway, thank you bread belly for the wonderful breakfast, bright colors and unexpected favor surprises.,My friend told me the hype around Kaya Toast, and I made it a bucket list item to visit this place. The first thing that shook me was how HEAVY the freaking toast was when I picked up my order. The next thing that blew my mind was the taste. Contrary to my typical breakfast, it was buttery, sweet, moist... but perfect. And it was ALL MINE (none to share)!!!! :D,Cute cafe to grab breakfast. Outdoor seating only. Had their kaya toast and gyeranbbang. Gyeranbbang was good but the star was the Kaya toast. Toast was nice and fluffy and the kaya flavor was good. Do recommend getting something savory with the kaya toast as it can be a bit too sweet.,Order ahead so you don't have to wait in line. There's also limited seating so it might be better to takeout. I got the breakfast sandwich and gyeranbbang. The breakfast sandwich was good, but I felt like it only had a thin layer of ham so it wasn't very substantial for the price. I toasted the gyeranbbang the next day and it was really tasty - an interesting take on the classic Korean snack. Will be back to try more pastries!,Wow....we're so lucky to have Breadbelly in our neighborhood, although we saw plenty of cyclists waiting in line to get their lunch on a Saturday. The menu is simple but unique. We shared a Bellydog and Tomato Baconwich that was again simple but unique. We also tried the Kaya toast as our little treat. Not too sweet yet satisfied our sweet tooth . I'd come back to try their daily specials next time.,I'm SO happy that I found this place before we fly home to LA! We ordered Kaya Toast (never had something like this before, it's sooo good!), breakfast sandwich (with sweet and sour kale and fermented chili paste, say whutt?!) and Char Siu Sando (slowly roasted pork belly with a creamy cucumber salad).,Great spot with outdoor seating and music. You can order ahead online starting at 10am day of, so we did that and were able to skip the line!The kaya toast was soooo good - the bread was fluffy and the kaya spread was incredible. I would probably not get the not ube tart - it was very potato heavy (since it's made from purple potato) and that overwhelmed the meringue on top and the crust.Definitely want to try out their specialty drinks as well next time!,I never really see anything like kaya toast in the US. I've only had it in Thailand, but this is really good. It tastes like sweet custard to me, and the toast but thick and soft. I also got the yuzu coffee, but im not a big fan of it, it has a citrusy? (Not sure) fizzy taste to it that i didnt like as much.,WHEN: Sunday @1pmIt was a last minute decision to come here after hanging out at Golden Gate Park. I've been wanting to come back to Breadbelly cuz I remember how good it was!  I didn't know what to expect since I know they change up thier menu.PARKING: I lucked out and found a free spot right in front! Otherwise since it's in a residential area, I'm sure you can find a free spot around the block.I love how they've set up a decent amount of tables to dine outdoors. The only downside to it is there's no shade but since it's SF, chances are you won't hit any sun...which didn't happen until around 1:30pm.You order outside at the entrance and they have a menu posted on thier windows. Some items were sold out, and sadly I have no idea what anything looks like.  So here's what I ordered:KAYA TOAST - $8Milk bread with coconut-pandan jam, maldon sea salt.I will always order this when I come here. It's so yummy as it is looks. It's a thick and decent size slice of milk bread that's been slightly toasted. So you have a nice crispy outer edges but still soft towards the center. Yes it's a thick slice but you'll taste plenty of that sweet Kaya spread and some of that better in between. That sea salt was a nice touch. Boy, was I happy camper.STONE FRUIT CRUMBLE TWICE-BAKED CROISSANT - $7.50Summer pluots, orange blossom frangipane, almond crumble.Perhaps the most expensive croissant I have ever purchased, haha!  But wow I definitely taste the pluot and orange. Very crispy and flakey. Yes my mouth is all scraped up on the inside but this is one dang good filled croissant--loved how they are generous with that!I wish I lived closer so I can come here often to try their many other interesting sounding items. Till next time Breadbelly!,If you haven't been here, what are you doing?? The kaya toast slaps. I am extremely lazy, yet I would trek out to Richmond just for the kaya toast. The toast is THICC, buttered and toasted *on both sides* (!!), and generously topped with a layer of kaya jam and a sprinkle of salt. I might have gasped after taking my first bite.,Big fan of Breadbelly. It can get a bit busy on the weekend but things move pretty quickly. They do run out of stuff so you can order online in the morning for pick up later in the day. Some stuff is only available on the weekends. I've never had the savory items (mostly sandwiches) but they sound good. All of the pastries I've had were delicious. Really thoughtful flavor combinations, well balanced, and clearly made with a lot of attention to detail. Croissant tarts are pretty rich and I'd definitely recommend sharing. The Mt. Tam cheesecake is awesome though not cheap as it's $26 for the whole and it's not huge (you can also get half for $13). This is probably expected though since it's made from the delicious and somewhat pricey Mt. Tam cheese from Cowgirl Creamery (probably my favorite cheese ever). It's a basque style cheesecake and not too sweet. It comes with some coffee crisps which I did not care for at all on their own but actually went really well with the cheesecake. They have a variety of pastries including a bunch that change to include whatever fruit is seasonal.I definitely recommend picking up a loaf of bread while visiting. While not the best milk bread I've had, it is good and worth trying. I like to slice it and store the slices in the freezer so you can pop it in the toaster whenever you want a slice; it freezes very nicely.Lastly, they actually have really excellent espresso. I was pleasantly surprised as I figured it would be okay but that their focus was more on the food but their lattes are really good with an perfectly pulled espresso shot. The matcha is also nice and they also have some more interesting drink options if you prefer something more adventurous. Overall, I'll happily visit again both when I run out of milk bread and also for the creative pastries and great coffee/espresso.,Expensive and well worth it. Normally when you slap on a lot of creative ingredients together it doesn't work out. However with Breadbelly, it not only have some of the most creative combination of ingredients, it actually tastes even better than it sounds! You order at the door and can enjoy the food in the provided limited tables outside. I came on Saturday around noon and there was a short line, but it moved quickly. I ordered a whole lot of items on the menu and it all tasted super good. The breakfast sandwich was nothing like any sandwich I'd ever had. It had korean ingredients with gochujang, pickled seaweed, fried egg, smoked ham, gruyere. And the bun is crispy on the outside yet so soft on the inside. While it sounds heavy with all of the ingredients, it's actually pretty light and refreshing and I would absolutely come back this.My next favorite is the Kaya toast. The Kaya is AMAZING and is the real deal. You can taste the pandan and coconut and it meshed so well together. The bread was toasted perfectly and was thick enough so that you can enjoy the softness of the bread on the inside. It's a big toast and can get you full. I'd say it feels heavier than the breakfast sandwich.The other food items: black sesame raspberry croissant tart, and the not-ube tart, Danish fig, was incredible. I'll give the ube tart a special shout out with its uniqueness of buttery crust with purple sweet potato, toasted meringue, shaved salted egg yolk (wow! A+ for creativity). I honestly wasn't expecting much and was just blown away with how well the ingredients worked together.The egg coffee was a shot of espresso with egg milk custard. Sounds weird but tastes super creamy. If there was any custard, I wouldn't know because it melted off and produced a nice egg-colored foam like a cappuccino that was really good! The foam had a sweet taste to it with a bit of salt to balance. Yum!Unfortunately not every creative item they had on the menu was an instant favorite. The Peach Leche flan wasn't really a flan I was familiar with...it seemed like a drink with ice. Also, I didn't really dig the Kaya bun. It looked like a version of the pineapple bun you get at dim sum places, but a Kaya version, and so I had expectations that it would be just as soft, but it just missed the mark for me. The Kaya filling itself was good, but the top part of the bun was too hard for me.Of the 10 items I got, 8 of them were spectacular. And instead of writing this off as 8/10 = 4 stars, the fact that they are pushing the boundaries and bold enough to play with unique ingredients AND make it taste amazing too, that is incredibly difficult to pull off. My hat goes off to Breadbelly and the staff and its an easy 5/5 for me. I'm already looking forward to coming back!,I've been wanting to try this place for so long and finally got to try it! We ordered online for pickup, very easy! You can also order there, but just be aware that they have limited outdoor seating.We ordered the breakfast sandwich, the everything bun, karage and the kaya toast. Definitely wanna come back to try more of their pastries! The egg sandwich - tasty, just wish it had a bit more meatEverything bun- it was ok, interesting concept with the cream cheese in the middleKarage- so good, flavorful and crispy! Their sauce is really good tooKaya toast- so fluffy and tasty! I loved how you can really taste the coconut flavor. I highly recommend getting this!!Tip- They also have special pastries on weekends only!!,Spent $6.75 on the 8oz matcha cappucino which was so memorable (read: traumatizing) that I wrote about it in my one line a day journal. Honestly cannot justify spending 1/3 of my post-tax hourly wage on a drink I can finish in 4 gulps but it's definitely a goal to work towards. Despite the massive dent it made in my wallet, I convinced myself it was tasty and worth the price because the matcha was strong and the drink was very smooth which I like. To be fair, I'd rather buy a matcha drink less frequently with better quality than be able to afford a watered down or sugary matcha more often. My friends ordered the kaya toast and I tried a bite and thought it was really tasty and unique. They also tried the chocolate croissant and liked it too. Overall the store is very unique and I like that they have outdoor seating. I think I would come back to try another pastry or drink because they are so unique but it's definitely an infrequent treat.,My friends have always wanted to come here and suggest me this place all the time. Finally got the chance to be around the area and went here. Kaya toast is amazing! The jam is sweet but there is sea salt to neutralize it, and the fluffy bread is toasted so well so gooood (warm, fluffy, and a bit crisp). It's a must if you like sweet and bread. I also get the pastries Kaya bun and gyeranbbang which are delicious too. I've been three times now within 2 weeks. I wish they sell the jam in the future, so I can get both the jam and bread, and I don't need to go far to get it :p.,how do they do that???perfectly crispy toast with soft interior slathered with coconut pandan jam that is not too sickeningly sweet. 12/10. Chef's kiss to the kaya toast.I also tried the butter mochi, which was deliciously flavored with browned butter, peanuts, and a hint of coconut cream. 10/10.I would come back for the kaya toast alone! I have never had anything quite like it.,Breadbelly is mad coppable. The breakfast sandwich is lit and I try to snag it at least every few weeks.,Breadbelly was delicious. It's a really cute breakfast spot. We ordered the kaya toast and breakfast sandwich. The breakfast sandwich was pretty good and it had different flavors than normal breakfast sandwiches I've had. I really enjoyed the kaya toast. The toast was very thick and fluffy. The kaya spread was absolutely amazing. I would definitely go again for the kaya toast. This spot is so popular that there were constantly people in line to order food. There's an outdoor area to sit and it felt so nice to eat and talk over great food.,Honestly fantastic. Everything we had here was *very* good, despite the (eye poppingly) high prices (for a bakery).The shrimp sandwich was totally worth it and the mushroom and cheese thingy (technical term) was delicious. Kaya toast was more like a bread pudding with the pandan jam on it - sweet but likewise delicious. This probably isn't a good place to frequent for your finances but if you're looking for the best baked goods you owe it to yourself to check it out!,Great local neighborhood spot with an interesting variety of offerings and they do a good job at changing it up based on what's in season. My go-to here and something I really find refreshing is the 50/50 which is like an iced coffee and Thai iced tea combo. But the main reason I'm here to write a review today is I recently tried the Egg Salad Bunwich and I gotta say they really knocked it out of the park with this one. The egg salad with asparagus, dijon, and pickles is such a unique pairing that works perfectly. Highly recommend getting one and trying it yourself.,Ordered online for pickup. Pickup was smooth.Breakfast sandwich was delish with several flavors coming through. Basque cheesecake was creamy and rich without giving you a terribly full feeling afterwards Kaya toast was a little too sweet for me but yummy nevertheless All other pastries pictured were well worth a try.,My daughter told me to try the kaya toast and I was not disappointed. Fabulously sweet breakfasty treat. I also had the belly dog, a snazzy presentation of a beef hot dog, but very gourmet and tasty. Eat there!,I got the breakfast sandwich and the kaya toast. All I have to say is, the kaya toast is a must-try. 100% worth the price!! Will definitely come back to get it again.,OMG! I literally had to put my sandwich down so I can write this review. First, I found this place on SF Eater, credit to them. Second, just ordered an egg salad bunwich and the bread is INSANELY amazing, notwithstanding the egg salad (the bread is warm btw). The presentation is impressive too. Also ordered the black sesame horchata, basque cheesecake (wow!), and Butter Mochi (drool). MUST come and check out this place, a foodie heaven. Will be back a dozen times more!!,Never had a bad item here! I started going to Breadbelly a few years ago only for coffee. They were the only place I knew that did a 50/50 (tea and coffee). I've always eyed their food menu and finally tried a few things recently. Everything is great. They are always introducing new items. It seems like they've gotten more busy since the pandemic. They also introduced outdoor seating which seems more spacious than before. There is always a line to order and pick up. Even with the tape on the ground, sometimes it's a little confusing and crowded at the door. I recommend ordering ahead if you know what you want and when you will be arriving. Sometimes they even ask you to order online in person. I guess it depends how staffed they are that day. I will say both food and drinks are pretty pricy. However, if you're craving something unique and want to treat yourself, I highly recommend it.,I when on november 17 2022. I order kaya bun. Very disappointed. I already ate kaya everywhere from Singapore, Malaysia n Indonesia. None of the kaya taste like this. This is not a real kaya.,Got the milk bun, nothing special.,not ube, but ube tart. summarizes the whole vibe: fun~~my friends and i stopped here for a quick breakfast and picked up some sandwiches (for lunch) for our hike. the outdoor area is so cute," although i do wish there are more seatings available. the sandwiches are not the """"I WILL DIE FOR""""", but they are still good (kind of overpriced tho). we got both the kakiahe egg salad sando and char siu sando. however, their not ube tart is really good (but might be a little too sweet).,I love, love, LOVE creative places with Asian-American inspo and was super excited to try Breadbelly. Unfortunately I was quite disappointed both by the kaya toast and the egg/asparagus sandwich. The kaya toast was pretty, with kaya neatly piped over a thick slice of toasted milk bread. The problem is that it is way too sweet. It really need a soft egg and some soy sauce and ground pepper, Singapore style! I thought maybe they would have made the kaya less sweet to compensate for this, but alas no. The egg/asparagus sandwich was also pretty but the was totally overwhelmed by the mustard. I could barely taste anything other than that; the egg flavor was totally gone. Cute outdoor seating but at least rn there is no shade at all.,I cannot give this place less than 5 stars with that kaya toast on the menu. I've never tasted anything like it. Haven't had the chance to try much of their other menu items, but I will. It's a little pricey but you get what you pay for.,Ordered online around opening time at 10am on a Saturday and estimated time for pickup was around 30-40 min. Swung by around 11 and there were lots of people filling their outdoor seating area (a couple of small tables and chairs and benches). There were two lines, one for pickups and one for ordering in person. Both lines seemed to move pretty fast. We ordered the kaya toast, breakfast sandwich, not-ube tart, kaya bun, black sesame cookie, and gyeranbbang.Breakfast sandwich - was still warm when we picked it up. The bun was soft and fluffy. The egg was medium (still had runny yolk but was fried) as advertised. The kale had a nice tang and was almost like a sweet kimchi with the fermented paste. There was a nice amount of ham. Together, it was a very satisfying sandwich.Kaya toast - the milk bread is so soft and was lightly toasted with butter and slathered with pandan coconut jam. Super decadent and delicious.Kaya bun - the pandan coconut cream was to die for. It was lighter than the jam counterpart on the kaya toast and had a more pronounced pandan flavor. The crust had a nice chew to it and tasted like it might be matcha? The bun itself was nice and fluffy. We didnt get around to the bun until late that night and it hadn't gotten soft or soggy. Kept well!Gyeranbbang - a cheesy corn bread with an egg inside! This was a nice savory piece but a little too soft of a corn bread for me. Not-ube tart - the salted yolk shavings on this tart were so unique and actually went really well with the purple sweet potato filling. I love sweet and savory things though so this was great for me. The tart was shell was like a cookie texture and held everything nicely. The toasted meringue didnt have much flavor but provided a soft transition from the sweet potato to salted yolk topping.Black Sesame cookie - the cookie was like a soft shortbread, light black sesame taste and sandwiched between was a slightly salty caramel. Yum!A little pricey but well worth a visit!,Went around 1pm and was slightly disappointed that most of the items were out already including the Kaya toast so we got 2 drinks - the black sesame horchata and the strawberry yogurt/kefir drink. The black sesame is good but you have to really like black sesame since thats the overwhelming flavor (not a bad thing for me personally). It's thin and refreshing (vs traditional black sesame dessert soup). The strawberry yogurt drink was really good too. It's on the thicker side (as you would expect) and super creamy, tangy, and sweet. Would def recommend this drink to any first timer.,My only regret: not trying this place sooner! I walk by this place all the time and I had been wanting to try it because I'd see people waiting prior to opening time on the weekends. I finally tried it and it was amazing! Kaya Toast: The bread itself is a fluffy and incredible smelling milk bread. And the jam on top is coconutty, but not so much to the point where it's overpowering. The flaky salt topping brings the flavors together beautifully. The green jam may shy away some people from trying thi, but TRUST IT. The Kaya Bun was also delicious. It had just the right amount of filling. I also tried the Good Morning Bun and Raisin Swirl and they were decent pastries. The Morning bun had a nice flaky exterior. Just not my favorites since I got hooked by the Kaya pastries.,I had already eaten two lunches but when I saw the crowd outside ordering, I had to grab a snack. Anyways, I grabbed the kaya bun and the brown butter mochi. I inhaled the mochi before I remember I should've snagged a picture... I had a bit more self control with the kaya bun though, probably because it was so beautiful. Both tasted great, mochi was chewy and soft and smooth but crunchy... The kaya bun was creamy and light, they were both wins in my book. Now I gotta go back with an empty stomach.,This place is incredible and I wish they would also open in Philadelphia. My friends suggested it for our visit to San Francisco. They have a lot of outdoor seating and each order is made to go, but you have just scrounge your own chairs and tables outside. It is quite chilly in San Francisco, but the food left our bellies warm and satisfied. I can't really recommend anything in particular to order because everything was delicious. I especially remember the Basque cheesecake, which was incredibly rich and the Kaya toast. This is the first Kaya toast I had that had sea salt flakes on and that really enhances the flavor. The breakfast sandwiches were all delicious. Run," don't walk to bread belly. And thank me later for this recommendation.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
San Tung,"Yaaaassss!!! Finally got to try the famous tee! It's always on my bookmarks.Highly recommended.- Fried chicken wings (you have to eat this anyway, it's a must)- Black Bean Noodles. I usually don't like this dish because it can be too bland or too much, but this was perfect.- Green beans- Pork dumplingsPro Tip.- There's a long wait on the weekends, we came for breakfast and still had to wait an hour. So put your name down, grab a boba, and walk around the neighborhood.- Order more chicken wings than you think you need. We thought that would be enough, but we wanted more, and unfortunately, they don't let you order more. I've never had a restaurant turn me down for ordering more! So once you order a meal, that's it. So once you order, that's it, that's all the food you get.- You can't order takeout in person, they'll kick you out. All takeout orders must be done over the phone. I witnessed an elderly man being turned away because he didn't do that and they didn't even give him the phone number. So he had to ask the couple to search for the phone number.Everything was very tasty and reasonably priced. Great value! I very, very rarely order more food in a restaurant while I'm still eating. But it was an explosion of flavor and everyone at my table was unanimous in wanting more wings, but unfortunately, what you get is what you get.,Decided to try this place after seeing it on an instagram post.... went on a Sunday like 5ish and the wait list was like 10' parties in . It's a small place with limited seating to wait . We would have walked around to kill time but it happened to start raining and we were unprepared .  Many people choose to wait outside and others mentioned waiting in their cars . Overall food was great and waiters were nice . We didn't try lots of options but for sure the wings were bomb .,DROP THE MIC FOR DRY FRIED CHICKEN! My go-to order:Dry fried chicken (wings or minced, depending on whether you're feeling like gettin' into it with your fingers or keeping it clean & cute). Accompany that -^ with seafood fried rice and stir fried string beans and *chef's kiss* Pro tip: -They don't do over the phone reservations or ANY reservation. Walk-ins only. Drop your name, walk around & time yourself to come back. They'll call you by phone (sometimes) so time yourself just in case. - If you don't fill like lining up for5ever, call ahead and do takeout. Don't do takeout in-person. You have to call ahead and expect about 20-30 minutes for them to complete your order.,Ordered the original dry fried chicken wings, honey walnut prawns, combination chow mein, dried sautéed string beans, black mushrooms with baby bok choy, dried fried calamari, and five spice beef soup noodles for take out. The chicken wings were somewhat crispy. The sauce they were coated in was spicier than I remembered. The noodle soup warmed me up. It had a deep five spice flavor. I had some the next day and the soup out of the refrigerator was like jello-you know it's full of the good stuff-collagen! Overall, the food was good. The only item I would skip for take out is the calamari. The sauce was served separated from the calamari (I assume so it wouldn't get soggy but the flavor wasn't really there). Also, the sauce used for the dry fried chicken wings and dried fried calamari is the same.,Had heard a lot about San Tung and tried twice to eat there before managing to catch a shorter wait time. San Tung is a local favorite and has a cult following especially for their fried chicken wings. We ordered the following: 1) Cold Noodles - Pretty similar to the Noodles with Peanut Sauce but comes with marinated beef slices. Would order this over the one with peanut sauce just because you get a few more toppings. 2) Noodles with Peanut Sauce - Was a bit on the sweeter side. 3) Original Dried Fried Chicken - Very crunchy and well seasoned. Definitely good, but a bit overhyped in my opinion. Nothing too special about it, you could get the same at Bonchon. 4) Braised Bean Curd - This was our favorite out of the five, great flavors and a good mix of textures. 5) Dried Sauteed String Beans - Was ok and could've been more dried. Not as good compared to Szechuan restaurants. Overall, taste-wise, I don't think it's the best restaurant for Chinese food, but it does the job. If you're in the area and the wait isn't too long, try the chicken. Tip: the waitlist will always look long, but a lot of people put their names down and leave so it's actually not too bad.,Finally able to take my bf to one of my #1 foodie spot ever near my hometown!! If you did not know, Santung is known for their Fried Dry Chicken Wings which are fried twice and has this addictive sauce. We got a side of stir-fried green beans as well to feel a tad more healthy. We are such fans of fried chicken and can describe this place as the healthier less processed version of BB.Q chicken. (: Went on Christmas Eve lunchtime and there was not much of a wait although many people were coming in and out for to-go orders. Service was quick and your typical Asian service. My number one Bay Area recommended spot ever as yelp elite!,San Tung is an absolute treasure in SF!! Get here early because waitlists for dine in can get pretty long. My party of 8 arrived at 5:30pm and was seated immediately. Hot tea is provided, but ice water is available upon request. Take out is JUST as good as dine-in but make sure you call ahead and it has never taken more than 20-30 minutes for me to get my order.What we ordered:- Original Dry Fried Chicken (12pc) x2 - this is THE thing to get at San Tung! The sauce is thick and slightly spicy. It also can be quite sweet depending on the batch. Chicken is crispy and OVERALL DELICIOUS- Pork Fried Rice - slightly salty, simple and filling! You can't go wrong with fried rice- Dry Black Bean Noodles - another MUST get dish at San Tung, The noodles are bouncy and cooked well. The sauce has bits of onion, seafood and zucchini- Fried Bean Curd - sticky sweet sauce, veggies and tofu. The dish is quite simple but so satisfying and compliments some of the other strong flavored dishes well- Braised Green Beans - a classic green bean dish with a garlicky soy sauce and the beans are just crunchy enough 11/10 San tung is great for take out or dine in! A MUST TRY in San Francisco,The chicken wings at San Tung has been hyped up for me for the past few months, so I had to try it for myself. Came here right at opening on saturday morning and there were already people lined up. The place was filled within the next half hour. The service was efficient, and the indoor could fit small to medium parties. Ambiance was what you'd expect from a typical Asian restaurant.The noodles came first. It was good, but I wasn't feeling it myself. The wings came next. The ""dry"" version was spicier than the ""wet"" version - but they were both saucy (so order rice to savor the sauce). The flavor and texture were both very good, and I highly recommend trying them for yourself. Def coming back in the future.,We had reservations for 6 and were seated almost immediately at 5:30pm on a thursday evening. We were delighted to get the private room in the rear of the restaurant. We ordered some vegetarian noodle soup, 2 orders of chicken wings, dry fried flounder, 2 orders of string beans and one order of spicy salt tofu. Everything was delicious and on point. I think they kicked up the spice on the flounder.  Eat them while their hot!  Flounder had a nice crust and the fish was so tender!  Yummy!  The chicken wings were saucy and crispy and succulent and meaty at the same time. Although, by the end of our meal the sauce on the plate of wings were a gooey thick mess. Not to worry, it's all good!  Make sure to pay cash as your bill is discounted. Make sure to gather at least 5 other fiends as you can make a reservation and virtually have no wait for your table!,Yay, my first meal of 2023! Definitely worth the wait and the fried chicken was amazing and ofc crispy :)Food is great. Service is average, typically Chinese restaurant. You'll prbly only speak to the staff once or twice to order and get your check and that's totally fine with me. Just have to wave them down if you need anything. The wait was shorter than I expected. Maybe like 30-45 minutes with like 8 parties in front of us but some people decided to leave so the wait time reduced. FYI there is a whiteboard when you walk in, so make sure you write your name down asap. Parking can be difficult amd you might have to make a few laps so definitely drop off a person to join the wait list while you search for parking in the neighborhood.Now let's talk about the food. Between the 4 of us we ordered the green beans, eggplant, and 2 plates of the fried chicken. This was the perfect amount to share. The green beans and eggplant was cooked to perfection with lots of flavors and sauce. The fried chicken came out hot and crispy. There's even chili oil on the table if you need some extra spice.I definitely recommend checking out this Chinese restaurant if you're visiting SF. It's a popular location so be prepared to wait or go right at opening time.,Unless I'm missing something, I don't see what the big deal is with San Tung. Almost eight thousand reviews and a majority of them are positive. But why?We arrived before noon. There was a small crowd outside waiting to get a table. A smaller crowd was gathered inside right in front of the door. I get it. It was raining. But people, is it going to kill you to wait outside so your not hovering over people eating or blocking the front door?There is a waitlist which is a wipe board on the wall. I guess it works. We waited about thirty five minutes, which wasn't bad. The food was just ok. Like I said, I'm not sure what the big deal is. We ordered the Dried Fried Chicken that my fellow Yelpers raved about. Our waiter said one order served two people. There were three of us so we ordered two orders. One order could easily serve four people. The chicken was just ok. It was a sticky mess to eat. We also ordered the Shrimp and Leak Dumplings. Honestly, they looked and tasted like something I could get at Costco. We tried the Black Bean Sauce Noodles and they had no flavor. The only dish that was any good was the Honey Walnut Prawns.I think what makes San Tung unique is the chaotic experience of waiting to get a table.,Every time I come to this place, it's always packed! Just your average, simple ambiance Chinese restaurant. Do not let that fool you cause their food is INCREDIBLE!!! Some times lines almost go out the door. So I always call for pick up. Hands down!!! THE BEST DRY FRIED CHICKEN IN THE WORLD! Lol. Probably cause I've never had it like this anywhere else. The sauce that it comes with is PHENOMENAL!!! Very UNIQUE: sweet, savory, and a kiss of spice. Just a kiss! Hehe. It's not spicy-spicy.Also, their Black Bean Noodles is TO DIE FOR! The flavor of the sauce has umami, lightly salty, subtle and leaves room for your tongue to wonder and crave for more!!! Slight seafood taste because of the squid and shrimp in it. The noods is the right texture. I wish they added more protein but good enough, I guess. I recently tried their dry-fried strings beans, as well and I LOVED IT!!! The prices increased so much but it is definitely worth it for once in awhile take out..:) eats,Ambiance: small and packed cantonese style restaurant, poor air quality, shared tables with strangers Service: very impatient and not providing anything useful Food & Drink: numerous items on the menu, and lunch special is available  Original Dry Fried Chicken - **** chicken wings deep fried in batter with garlic, ginger and roasted pepper, 12pcs, very uneven sizes, large and small pieces, very sweet and not too spicy, recommend for the flavor   Shrimp and Leek Dumplings - ** 12 little dumplings filled with a savory mixture of ginger and garlic infused with ground shrimp and boiled Chinese chives, terrible taste and bold msg flavors, and could barely taste shrimp    Tea - ** poor quality Price: moderate portions and affordable prices, about $$40 per person, no surcharge if paying cash,This place is always packed so I never thought of going but obviously it gets you more curious. So I went here with a friend. Their waitlist is still primitive with a white board but I appreciate this.The wait was long but after my experience, the wait was so worth it! We were sat in the large round table along with another couple yet it still felt intimate. Everyone rages about the chicken wings so we ordered it. It didn't disappoint. It's deep fried and glazed in their signature sauce. For those who prefer dry chicken, this might not be for you but it's definitely worth the try. I enjoyed every bite and every glaze that got stuck in between my teeth. We also ordered the string beans, combination fried rice, dumplings, and the garlic eggplant. I wasn't impressed with the eggplant dish but the rest were delish. The string beans has some sweetness in it, the dumplings were savory, the fried rice was packed with all the meat and the seafood in it were tender. Finally, the garlic eggplant was also delicious but it was cut lengthwise and drowned in its sauce. I didn't feel like taking a photo of it  I'm sorry I'm not good at describing the meal but 1) it's worth the wait, and 2) the food is really delicious!,Does San Tung live up to its hype?I visited San Tung after a day at GGP. I walked over and coincidentally arrived just a few minutes before they opened at 4:30PM. My party of two were able to snag one of the last two tables so we didn't have to wait. Omg, it was probably 4:27PM and the restaurant was already FULL. So if you're planning on coming here for the first wave of guests upon opening, arrive 10-15 minutes ahead because they seemingly seat people before opening.We ordered the original dry fried chicken (ofc), dried sauteed string beans, and dry black bean sauce noodles. The black bean sauce noodles came first, and after a long day outdoors, this hit the spot. Although the menu calls it ""dry"", there was plenty of sauce in this dish. We had asked for scissors to cut the noodles since they were a bit long. I really enjoyed the black bean sauce and the stringy and chewy noodles. The shrimp was also delicious, and even the excess onions used to cook the dish were filled with flavor due to the black bean sauce. Definitely recommend for a good carb.The string beans were next and wow this was a huge plate of beans. $15 for string beans sounds like a lot, but there was probably like 6 servings here. The beans were oily and crunchy, but I would have loved a stronger garlic taste. The original dry fried chicken finally arrived and it was piping hot. One order comes with 6 wings. The wings were drenched in a sweet-tangy-spicy sauce. I did enjoy these, but they were a bit too sweet for my liking since I prefer all savory wings. I don't love fried chicken so for me, this was expendable. However, if you love fried chicken, I can definitely see the hype. -1 star for the service. Before we were even maybe halfway to being finished with our meal, they gave us the check. We were still eating and they gave us takeout boxes. I felt extremely rushed, but it's a Chinese restaurant so unfortunately hospitality isn't the best. However, if you're traveling a far ways to try out San Tung, this ""rushed service"" would definitely dim my mood.,San Tung was a must try when we visited SF and was definitely worth the hype! We arrived right when they opened and there was a line at the door. We were seated quickly and the staff were helpful in their food recommendations. We ordered their super popular chicken wings which were fried to perfection and soaked in a sweet and savory sauce that paired super well with rice. We also ordered their fried green beans which were seasoned well and shrimp and leek dumplings were had a great filling to skin ratio. Loved the flavors and will definitely be back when we visit!,SOOO good. We luckily came in while there was no wait and got seated immediately! Right after, the sign up sheet got filled up and there were at least 14-20 groups waiting, so would definitely recommend trying to go a little bit earlier in the evening to avoid the dinner rush. Food was realllyyyy good. Dumplings were super juicy, chicken was really flavorful and crispy, and the noodles were really flavorful too. Service was a little slow since it was super busy so it took a little bit to get the food but it was definitely worth it. The tea also tasted really good with all the different dishes. All came out super fresh, warm, and flavorful,This was one of our favorite Chinese restaurants pre pandemic. We wound wait in line for an hour to get the privilege for those delicious plates.What happened?Fried fried chicken - this signature dish where we ordered a onsite -- no sharing per person-- went way down hill. - teeny tiny pieces that has stringy meat hanging from it. Unappealing- dry dry dry. Did the kitchen refry wings  from last night?- unflavored I wanted to give back the plate to the kitchen but out of respect for the business , I did not. 1 star Potstickers- came cold, skin was very thick and filling was bland 3 stars Dan San Mein- one of the stars for lunch 3 1/2 stars Shrimp with rice - couldn't believe the kitchen used THREE different sized shrimps to ""fill"" the plate . Some of the shrimp were about nickel  size, mixed in with larger shrimp about quarter size. Terrible way to ""stretch"" the dish... or maybe the kitchen ran out of large shrimp?  Flavor was good but for the price?? :(Shrimp and leek dumplings- the other star for lunch. I believe this was the best dish. Came out hot and juicy with each bite. 4 starsNot the same as before, and I don't know if we will ever return. Sorry to say.,Finally got to try the famous San Tung after watching so many videos about their fried chicken wings on Tiktok. My friends warned me about the long line so we came here at 7:45 and there were still 5 parties before us. It's cool to see they still use a whiteboard for sign in list. After 15 minutes wait, we were quickly seated . The server was very nice and quickly introduce us their popular items. Sadly they were out of bean curd :( Fried Chicken Wing : 5/5 Definitely one of the best I've had . The skin was crunchy and the meat was so flavorful , which I really enjoyed even though it was a litte too sweet for me . Beef Fried Rice : 4.5/5 The fried rice is excellent and go well with the chicken wings , btw I should have gotten pork or chicken .Black Bean Sauce Noodles : 3/5 This dish somehow similar to Korean Black Bean sauce noodle . It comes with seafoods but the flavor was kinda bland to us so we did not eat much . Parking is hard because there are some restaurants in the area . I was lucky to find a street parking 2 blocks away so I don't know how to find a parking in the weekend . If you are here for the first time , I would recommend to get the fried chicken wing and fried rice first and the noodles if you are still hungry . Will definitely be back to order some wings because they have online ordering .,I wouldn't give them the title for best wings in the city. Delicious, maybe nostalgic, but best ehhh. The food is tasty but it's such a hot mess in this place. I highly recommend take out. There's no ambiance so no reason to dine in. It's loud. The tables are set close to one another to where the servers had to slid past the seats. It's a very popular place, the front door opened and closed nonstop. Our table was towards the front so it was quite cold with the wind blowing in. Not to mention distracting having so many people in a tight space in the front waiting for a table and other trying to enter to sign in. Our wings came out first and we waited another 20+ mins for the black bean noodles. When I asked a server if she can check on our last dish, she misunderstood and told me I can only order once. The wings are crispy with a thick caramel texture to the sauce. Pretty addicting. The dry black bean noodles were even better. The difference between dry and regular black bean is just the meat/seafood, the noodle and sauce is the same in both.They've been in business a long time so their system works for them but my experience here doesn't justify a return. Save yourself the trouble and take out. Small discount for using cash.,San Tung is a must visit when you're in the San Francisco area. I've only dined in one-time here and all other times have been take-out. Guess what is the one take-out item that I get... their Dry Fried Chicken Wings! OMG... they are the best and most scrumptious chicken wings I've ever eaten! Hot, crispy, sweet and spicy all in one! Don't know what the secret is... BUT DANG THEY ARE SO FINGER-LICKING GOOD! Make sure you get the dry version. Believe me when I say they are the BEST! I don't just get one order... I get about 3 to 4 orders. I love my chicken wings! I'm salivating right now as I'm typing this review... TELEPORT me to SF right now! LOLThe next time I go to SF, I'm going to bring a big cooler so I can bring some chicken wings back to So Cal. You know I would do it LOL. Not just for the chicken wings, but also for some Marco Polo Italian gelato, too. So many great eats from SF that I wish were also available in So Cal. I used to visit SF once a year, but since COVID-19, my visits have been limited.Come by San Tung and get your chicken wings! They do get really busy so I would recommend you pre-order over the phone. Happy San Tung'ing!,I have loved San Tung for years and been awaiting the return of indoor dining as takeout just isn't the same. must orders for me are always the green beans and the dry fried chicken wings. even though it says dry it does have a sticky sauce which is absolutely addicting. sweet and salty and spicy. the green beans are the perfect accompaniment because they're flavorful but not too salty so they absorb some of the flavorwe also got the black bean noodles and fried fish. ordered the black bean noodles with no seafood since my boyfriend is allergic but the flavor was a bit off without it.. missing some depth and a little too sweet. the fried fish was crispy and similar sauce to the chicken but my boyfriend said it was too fishy for himanyways I love San Tung and will keep coming back to eat those green beans and wangz. we were sitting inside waiting to be seated when the host called out another table who left so he was super nice and let us take the table :),I finally get the hype!Experience: I went right after work on a Thursday. The wait wasn't too long. The line got much larger around 7pm. I recommend coming early to skip the line. Also, the service was speedy but I didn't feel rushed during my meal.Food: I think the price for the amount you get is great! I had enough for leftovers. The food was amazing. I went for their most popular items that I see a lot on Yelp. The wings were as good as everyone says they are. I love green beans and theirs did no disappoint. The black bean noodles were saucy and rich.Notes: By the way, they are closed on Tuesdays and Wednesday, which is a bummer. 9 Ave I'm Inner Sunset has decent amount of street parking. There's no outdoor seating. To sign up for the waitlist, there's a whiteboard inside of the restaurant, by the door.,San Tung does not live up to the hype anymore... Service is alright but food is average and not fresh. - Original Dry Fried Chicken: chicken was small and dry. The sauce tastes good though. Probably one of the only things you should order from here. We noticed they gave a large table next to us bigger pieces of chicken for their orders. - Pork Dumplings: SOUR and smells bad. Unfortunately my dad dipped multiple dumplings in vinegar so he wasn't able to taste the sourness. However, immediately after I had my first bite, I realized the meat was sour and gave off a pungent smell. Definitely NOT FRESH!!! Additionally, the meat was more reddish pink in color meaning they added baking soda, probably to mask the freshness as well. We brought it up to the server and he brought the dish back to the kitchen to check with the chefs. After 5-10 min, he came back to say that we were right and that the meat filling had been made three days ago. We suspected it was longer than that. The server said he would replace it with shrimp and leek dumplings, with no apology at all. - Shrimp and Leek Dumplings: shrimp was not fresh. Additionally, the filling gave off a slightly unpleasant smell again, but not as bad as the pork dumplings.What can I say, just don't get the dumplings... I will not be coming back again.,I've been here many times even when they had the 2nd location (which I wish they still had), but I only come here for the chicken.  I always have great service and don't mind the wait.  Just make sure you actually go into the restaurant and put your name on the board or else you'll wait for nothing.Anyway, my favorite items are the the chicken wings, honey walnut prawns, and the peanut noodles (I can't remember the actual name).  The last time I went here, I ordered the spicy garlic eggplant, but it wasn't good this time.One thing I do wish is that they take out the carpet and replace with tile or vinyl flooring.  Other than that, I do love their chicken!,San Tung is a long time staple of San Francisco, and is considered to serve the best Chinese chicken wings in the city. We arrived on a busy Saturday afternoon and signed our names down on the whiteboard by the front entrance. We were quoted about 2 hours, and the wait time is normally as long as it looks. Service was very quick and efficient once we were seated, and we were served hot tea while browsing the menu. The menu was extensive that included many Cantonese dishes, but we opted for our favorite staples of the chicken wings (boneless), string green beans, and honey walnut shrimp. Everything came out relatively quickly and our favorites were the chicken wings and string green beans. We liked how they had the option of of either bone-in or diced chicken, as we normally don't like to use our hands while eating. The flavor is a unique glaze consisting of different Chinese spices. We also got the spicy version that had a mild kick (not super spicy at all). I would try stopping by on a weekday when it's not that crowded. They also have options for take-out and weekday lunch specials. Really great Chinese food and chicken wings at an affordable price.,This place is such an OG and must try restaurant when visiting the Bay Area. I've been coming here for over 5 years! It gets very busy and you do have to wait to get seated. I was there on a Saturday night around 7:30 pm with a party of 2. We had to wait around 30 minutes for a table. But trust me it's worth it! We ordered the famous chicken wings. 10/10! The best in the Bay Area. We also tried the lemon chicken with white rice. Service was great! Staff is so nice and always around to refill your drinks.,I was actually more surprised by how much I loved the veggie chow mein and the potstickers! Like whoa, the way they steam and fry and mold the dumplings together was cool. The chow mein was similar to a lo mein and it was nice and mild in flavor with parts of garlic and white pepper. Now for the wings? I'm a newbie so I wasn't sure if I was supposed to emphasize DRY? Our plate had a lot of sauce and although I ubderstood the profiles of spicy, salty, sweet,  fatty, tangy, after the 2nd wing SWEET AND SUGARY took over completely for me. I'm happy to have tried this breaded and fried and tossed wings but next time I'm gonna say less sauce. Also service was fast which was excellent. Tips: parking around the block or in front of the restaurant with meters. Sign in and out your name down on the white board inside. They close on certain days and every day at 3 pm for their lunch break.,I've been waiting to dine here for almost 6yrs now. I finally came last Saturday for dinner with my wife and her family. We reserved 3 tables for about 27 people. I will go straight to the point.Their highly appraised original dried fried chicken was just OK to me. I thought the chicken was a bit small in size (drums and wings). The garlic and ginger glaze sauce was delicious but I thought they drenched their chicken a bit much which took away from the chicken's crisp. I gave their chicken 3.5-4 stars out of 5. The chicken didn't taste like anything special; I've had similar chicken from the past at Korean fried chicken spots and a few other Chinese hole-in-the-wall mom & pop shops. To me, I wouldn't stand in line again for this. I see people standing in line for hours just for this and it's nothing special. To me, even Bon Chon is still better in taste, size, and price.We tried all the other popular dishes such as their green string beans and black bean sauce noodles. The green beans taste exactly like the ones you can order at a regular Chinese restaurant or even at a Panda Express. I'm not sure why people get so excited for this lol. Also, their black bean sauce noodles were just ok too; to us, it was bland and plain tasting. It barely had any flavor. We all enjoyed their beef chow mein more which had lots of garlic flavor and more of a tasty dish. I also did enjoy their spicy Mongolian beef and walnut shrimp. In conclusion, I thought this place is over hyped. Yes, their chicken is good but not worth standing in line for especially for an hour. All the other dishes are simply regular in which you can get an any other Chinese restaurants in the city. This is just my opinion. For all you people that may hate on this, please go try other Asian chicken restaurant spots or even local mom & pop shops even if they aren't as popular and just taste it out. Stop following the star review hype and just be open to trying low key chicken spots. You might just agree with me . Me and my wife will definitely come back again but not for a while. We aren't that desperate for their chicken.,I was in San Francisco this past weekend for a concert and I was highly recommend to come here by one of my friends to try their famous fried chicken and when I saw how many reviews there were for San Tung and all the pictures, I knew I had to stop by while I was in town!I came with my group of friends right when they opened their doors at 4:30pm for an early dinner to avoid the potentially long wait this past Saturday and my assumptions were correct because after they opened and we were seated, there was art least a 30-45 minute to get in!We were seated quite quickly along with every other party until the restaurant had reached capacity which I thought was impressive and luckily my group knew what to order beforehand, so we were able to get our food quickly!Dry Black Bean Sauce Noodles - The noodles were cooked perfectly and there was so much black bean sauce which I loved although it can be a little messy to eat! The black bean sauce had a great earthy, flavor and wasn't too sweet or bitter!Original Dry Fried Chicken - Simply AMAZING! The batter is so crispy and combined with their addicting sauce, it's literally an explosion of flavor in your mouth! There's a perfect blend of sweet and spicy from the sauce and these are best eaten right at the table! You must order this when you come here. You won't regret it!Pork Mu Shu - They give you some wraps to put the mu shu in along with hoisin sauce and scallions. This was a surprisingly delicious dish and I loved the pork, it was tender and flavorful and paired well with all the veggies!The portions here are pretty big and for the three dishes my group ordered. it was more than enough food to fil us up for the rest of the day! I highly recommend stopping by if you are in San Francisco, you won't regret it!,I personally don't recommend getting take out unless you can eat it right away! One time I got take out and when I ate it around 20 minutes later, it didn't taste the same and the crunch to the wings were gone. The wait is definitely worth the wait! I've been coming back to San Tung over and over for the past 6 or so years and I don't think I can ever get tired of it! I always get the jjajjangmyun, chicken wings, sweet and sour pork (underrated!), and string beans. I also tried the tomato egg drop soup and it was good! The wait is usually around 40 mins! The wait doesn't take too long since there's so many seats inside. It goes by pretty fast! I would recommend walking around the area or just waiting inside your car.,The Dry Fried Chicken Wings have such a devoted, longstanding following that I believe it's considered heresy to say anything critical about them. Well, tie me to a post and light the twigs because I can't find it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in my heart (or more specifically, my stomach) to assert that those wings were my be-all, go-to food. They were too sticky sweet for my taste, and I could barely taste the garlic and ginger with which they were apparently fried. Perhaps I broke a cardinal rule by coming here alone during the peak of their lunch rush.They seated me at a table that was already occupied by a party of three who looked to be eating for a party of six. I reviewed the Lunch Specials menu (weekdays 11-3) and noticed they offered a half-dozen of their legendary wings for $12.50. Believe it or not, I had never tried them before because I figured an order consisted of a pile of wings on a huge platter that made exactly one rotation on the lazy susan before they disappeared. I ordered them and promptly received a generous bowl of Hot and Sour Soup.I found it quite satisfying (photo: bit.ly/3UHV9nE). The wings arrived soon after in a pool of that sticky sauce (photo: bit.ly/3BXtB5i) along with a hefty scoop of white rice (photo: bit.ly/3y45L6K). My honest feeling was that I wished they offered a no-sauce option or at least put on the side. Maybe they do, but the staff was so harried that they weren't interested in engaging in conversation. Listen, I could very well come back because a million fried wings aficionados can't be wrong, besides which there's a hundred other options to consider at a later hour.FOOD - 3 stars...the dry fried chicken wings were overrated, the soup was good thoughAMBIANCE - 3 stars...chaotic during lunch SERVICE - 2.5 stars...curt, especially to solitary dinersTOTAL - 3 stars...did an angel get its wings?RELATED - Exploring the Sunset? Here's a collection of places I've visited and reviewed: bit.ly/2EI8eIJ,Would say this place generally lived up to the hype; is it worth the incredibly long wait when you're already in the area? Not particularly, considering there are so many other amazing restaurants near GGP, but I would say worth a try if you're a San Francisco resident just to say you had it!The chicken wings were really good, but a little too seeet for my taste. I think the real star is the dry black bean noodles!! They are absolutely delicious, the perfect Chinese-Korean fusion dish. We also tried the combination spicy soup noodles, which were also quite good and had a very savory, seafood-y flavor. Honestly enjoyed both noodle dishes more than the chicken. For the two of us, it was WAY more than enough food. We came on a Sunday evening around 6pm and had to wait for 14 groups ahead of us... took about an hour or so. If you're thinking of coming, just try to come at an off time otherwise, I'd say it's not really worth the wait.,I am being generous with this review, see my 6/23/22 Kogi Gogi BBQ Review. Quality/Quantity - Good comfort food. Today we got the following:Shrimp & Leek DumplingPork DumplingOriginal Dry Fried Chicken - One of their must have signature dish.Seafood Black Bean Sauce Noodles - Generous amounts of seafood.Dried Sauteed String Beans - Another generous portion. Good flavor. I thought they gave generous portions, but my guest and wife were able to eat it all, compliments to the chef. All were good, but not sure if I am just reminiscing but I remembered it even better in the past. Atmosphere - Small local business. In the past it would be an hour wait for a table.One small private room, seats approximately 10 people.Open 5 days a week from 1 am to 8pm, closed Mon & Tue.Street parking, good luck. Today I parked half a mile away and walked some very steep hills to the restaurant, then uphill all the way back to my car...Successful to-go business," I believe it was the owner that handled all the to-go orders. It was a """"show"""" to watch", message me for details...  I can share a laugh. Service - Good, we took an hour to eat and they were very patient with us. Actually, they took 10 minutes just trying to find our check so we could pay. But we were in no hurry as I just had more chores to do later that day... Price - $86 + tip; they also offer 10% cash discounts. Owner Comment - Congrats on your success since 1986. I am glad you are/seem fully staffed again. Love your huge kitchen," it would be nice to open that up more so we can have a better """"show"""" from your chefs.",Must Try Their Fried Chicken! Is one of the best-fried chickens ever! We came in on a Sunday at noon. It was a LONG LINE already. I guess it shows how good this place is. Even is a traditional Chinese food but is popular with young people. After waiting for 20 mins, I got a seat and ordered pork dumplings and Fried Chicken. As a person who was born and raised in San Tung ( Shan doing province), I was very excited to try their dumplings. Because dumplings are one of the most famous dishes in San Tung. After I tried it, I got a little disappointed. Their pork dumplings did not have any of the San Tung dumplings' feathers, like big size, thick skin but soft skin, juice fillings, balanced veg + meat ratio, good flavor, and come in with hot temperature. This restaurant's pork dumplings were just OK, size is like a southern Chinese dumpling size, the skin is thin, the filling is not too dry but not juicy either, not that much flavor didn't taste the Chinese lettuce at all. Even though their fry chicken is really good. But I would still give a 3 because of the dumpling.,If you're ever in SF, be sure to stop by San Tung for their famous dry fried chicken wings, which is known to be the best chicken wings in SF.We got to the area by 4pm, which we thought was going to be early. We kept going around try to find parking, and as we went past the restaurant again, we noticed people were already lining up and the line grew longer, so I suggested letting me off first so I can wait in line for us. They started to let people in at 430pm and I was one of the few fortunate ones to be able to grab a table.Everyone who comes here always orders the chicken wings, as for other dishes, we also ordered the honey walnut prawns which is my bf's favourite, and for veggies, we got the spinach with garlic. The food came out quite fast. Next time I would like to try their black bean sauce noodles as I saw quite a few people ordering it and it looked pretty good.I would recommend lining up early if you can so you can get a table right when they open, otherwise the waitlist can be quite long as by the time we left, there were close to 20 people on the waitlist.,I can definitely see why this place is one of the top rated restaurants in the city and arguably the best Chinese eatery in all of the Bay. The chicken wings, green beans, and black bean sauce noodles are all must orders when you visit and the dumplings looked really good as well. Protip: Trying to come I'm when they first open and write your name on the whiteboard inside and make sure to check in with them so they know your party is waiting.,"My family has been coming here for years and we've been dreaming about the chicken wings for years! I personally don't believe that they are overhyped because it's a flavor of chicken wings. That is so hard to forget and so hard not to crave. I will not say that it is for everyone because it is not """"American style"""" I may not be what you expect.This is a great place to go if you're trying to feed a lot of people with a modest budget. Their menu has something for everyone and all of their dishes have been very tasty of what we have tried. Some of my favorite things to get here is the sizzling rice soup and their hot and sour soup. Although the wings are the most famous thing from this place", I'd argue that the fried fish in the same style of the wings is even better since it has a different taste than the chicken but it's still super juicy and the sauce is a great companion for the fish's taste. It does get crowded here so if you were local, I'd recommend coming on a weekday night that is not Thursday or Friday. It seems that the crowds always come on Thursday nights until closing time and Saturdays after 1230. Expect a wait if you come on a weekend.,Come for some of the best Chinese dry fried chicken, eggplant, black bean noodles," and more. Don't come for """"healthy"""" food; if you ate a nice variety", you will leave with a bit of unwanted sodium and grease in your mouth..The service is fast, and despite the rush hour, our table was still given lots of attention. Sit down at a large lazy susan, eat up, and chat with some nice and warm tea, which I loved in the cold SF night.,Showed up right at opening to avoid any crowds and get parking. It was a Saturday so we beat the rush and found street parking which was a plus.The food: Pork dumplings: tasted fresh with a nice filling, but I've had better. 6/10String beans: tasty and had a crunch the sauce was nice, fresh garlic or spice would've enhanced the dish 8/10Combination fried rice: average 5/10Beef and broccoli: broccoli was cooked well, beef was ok with sauce 6/10Fried Chicken: apparently the star of the restaurant but I guess I missed the appeal, was it the sauce that really set it to another level? I've had better at Bonchon. Overall I don't see the hype. Really underwhelmed with my experience.,Yaaaassss!!! Finally got to try the famous San Tung! It's been on my bookmarks forever (even before moving up here but previous attempts failed for one reason or another). Highly recommend:- Fried chicken wings (you must get these no matter what, it is THE thing to get) - Black bean noodles: I don't usually like this dish because it can be too bland or too beany but this was perfect - Green beans - Pork dumplings Pro tip:- There is a long wait on weekends, we came for early dinner and still had to wait an hour. So put your name down, get boba and walk around neighborhood. - Order more wings than you think you need. We thought this would be enough but we wanted more and unfortunately, they DO NOT let you order more. I've never had a restaurant turn me down for ordering more food before! So once you order, thats it, thats all the food you're getting. - You cannot order takeout in person, they will turn you away. All takeout orders must be done over the phone. I witness an elderly fella get turned away for not doing that and they didn't even tell him the phone number! So he had to ask this couple to search up the phone number. Everything was very delicious and affordable. Great value! Its very very rare for me to order more food at a restaurant while I'm still eating. But it was such an explosion of flavor that everyone at my table unanimously wanted more wings but unfortunately, what you get is what you get.,Finally got to try this famous SF institution! Have avoided this place for a long time because of the lines, but thankfully found the chance to try it tonight!Overall impression: Nice casual, Chinese restaurant, love the cozy, bustling atmosphere, tea cups with a clinky metal teapot, chilli oil and vinegar on a small lazy susan, with *gasp* even cups of cold water brought to the table! Great service (efficient), though they will only let you order once (at least for my party) no add-ons or table-hogging towards the end of your meal!Eats:- Dry-fried chicken wings: Crunchy, sweet/garlicky/mildly spicy, it brought me back to Portland's old Pok-pok sticky chicken wings! Though a friend thought they were too sweet (and they were a little skimpy on the meat), the flavor was satisfying enough to check the boxes! I enjoyed the crunch, though I wish the wings had been a bit bigger.... 4/5- Green beans: more limp than I expected, still had a nice enough texture and were a much-needed balance to the very overpowering chicken sauce! Not as crunchy or garlicky as I would have liked, but still delicious!! 4/5- Black bean Noodles: Very flavorful, but not unique...I felt they had too much of a beef to seafood ratio. Yummy, but there was too much sauce; I wish there had been more onions or seafood to balance out the textures of the dish. Still good! 3.5/5Would I return: Yes, if I was craving the fried chicken wings and green beans :) One of the best restaurants in the area for sure!,Finally made it to San Tung to try their fried chicken wings & black bean noodles!! I loved the vibe of the restaurant, which is very much akin to the Chinese restaurants I grew up eating in: busy, loud, efficient, a little chaotic - and delicious food. The fried chicken wings are well known and they really are tasty, but for me it's not line-out-the-door must-try-in-SF tasty. I personally prefer Korean fried chicken (twice-fried, saucy, sweet) and Sichuan / Chongqing chicken (dry, peppery, shallow-fried). San Tung's fried chicken lands in-between but didn't quite have the kick I'm looking for! San Tung's menu has a lot to offer but I probably didn't appreciate it since we only had a party of 2. I'd come back with a larger party to try more items, but if you're just there for the wings, I think there are other restaurants that offer a tastier fried chicken. Also -- service there was pretty meh, we felt rushed out by the employee because there was a big line outside (understandable, but doesn't leave a great feeling).,San Tung is a popular establishment in the Sunset district known for their Chinese-style fried chicken. After hearing so many good things about San Tung, I was excited to try their popular dishes. We ordered their Cold Noodles and Dry Fried Chicken. The Cold Noodles were delicious; the noodles were bouncy and the peanut sauce was nutty. The cucumbers added a refreshing and crunchy element to the dish as well. The Dry Fried Chicken was star of the table. The fried chicken was cooked perfectly, tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. The sauce was sweet and savory, and coated every bit of the fried chicken. However, what was disappointing was how slow the Dry Fried Chicken came out. It seemed that they forgot our chicken, and we had to wait 30 minutes after our noodles arrived. We had to call over our waitress multiple times to have them check the kitchen. Despite this incident, the food was definitely worth the hype and is a must-try in SF!,I will definitely come back for their fried chicken. Hot, crispy, sweet and spicy. Ordered some dumplings that felt traditional with the thicker dumpling skin. I also had their green beens and black noodles which I also highly recommend. The wait time can be quite long but it's worth it. The servers were very quick and always walking around to service you. Food came out fast, too. Definitely coming back.,7/31/22I've always heard of how San Tung had really delicious chicken wings.  My boyfriend's brother and wife were in town and wanted to get Chinese food, and since I had not been to San Tung, I suggested that we go there.  We managed to find parking a couple blocks away and as always, there was a huge crowd in waiting in front.  I checked us in on the waitlist and there were 11 parties ahead of us.  We ended up waiting 20 minutes which wasn't too bad.  Here are the dishes we ordered:1. Pork dumplings2. Pot stickers3. Mongolian beef4. Chicken with black mushrooms5. Sweet and sour pork6. Deep fried chicken wings7. Hot and sour soupThe food overall was pretty good.  The dishes all came out relatively fast.  My only complaint would be towards the hot and sour soup.  It tasted good with the tofu and egg whites, but after a few spoonfuls it started to taste too peppery.  I think the wings were good.  My boyfriend and his brother thought the wings were just okay.  The sweet and sour pork definitely brought back memories of my childhood since we used to eat that dish frequently.  The dumplings were delicious and I was surprised by how many they gave us.  The mongolian beef and chicken with black mushrooms were both flavorful, with large portions and covered in sauce.  The consensus at the table was that out of all of the dishes, the best one was the pot stickers.  They were fluffy, golden-fried puffs of deliciousness.  Service was minimal since they were busy, but the times we did need stuff (more water, napkins), they were very quick to respond.  I would definitely come back.,I haven't eaten inside San Tung in a few years. This was actually only my second time, so I was a little nervous about their wait time and seating. My friend and I made it just in time, a few minutes before they stopped taking customers on the waitlist. Since there were only two of us, they seated us at the large round tables on the left side and seated another couple infront of us. We were across from each other so there was ample distance. We ordered the sizzling rice soup, SO YUMMY I love their soup and the water chestnuts that add a fun bite to the dish. I wasn't sure which sweet and sour pork to order and asked for the server's recommendation. He looked at me and asked if I was Korean and then suggested the tangsuyuk over the Chinese sweet and sour pork dish with the red sauce. **suffice it to say, their tangsuyuk is so crispy and crunchy on the outside, as if you're eating fried chicken! But there's also so much pork inside and the sauce and veggies all go together so perfectly. **it is not a popular opinion but the dry wings don't really do it for me. The soy sauce and peppery flavor isn't anything special and the wings we had were on the drier side. There wasn't much meat to the wings and it was sort of bone dry, but that's ok. I can just order their other great dishes (-: **mushroom with bokchoy and garlic is divine. It's a perfect palate cleanser and goes well with the meat dishes. We wrapped up at around 3:15pm and the restaurant was pretty empty at this point. I'm sure he'll never see this, but to the very handsome, dashing guy who I ran into in front of the restroom, I wanted to say I couldn't stop admiring you from afar and that I loved your style.,Dry wings 5/5Wings have good texture Sauce nice flavour Spicy ness for a reason and not just spicy to be spicy Black bean sauce noodlesStrong flavour Shrimp in it is niceWould do without squid 85/100Green beans Top tier90/100,I'll never have anything bad to say about this place. It's a SF staple so while visiting a friend from LA we had to take my fiancé. Place was busy as usual and we came on a Friday night. The only thing I'd say is it would be great if they had a waiting room/space. It gets cramped so fast and it was freezing outside if you had to wait.We got seated within 25 minutes or so. Got two orders of the wings, black bean noodles, and the crispy green beans. The wings are always amazing. Finished almost all of them between the 3 of us. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The flavor is so good. We had a nice balance of flavor between the wings, noodles, and green beans. It's just comfort food and I'll never say no to it.,San tung... what can I say? Love this place especially their popular fried chicken! You can order it diced or traditional wings. Their flavor is out of this world.. only one complaint is they need to update their store hours we came here twice and according to yelp they were supposed to be opened but they weren't. (I'm from LA so it's a bit disappointing to drive this far and not be able to satisfy my cravings) End up having to go across the st where they claimed they have better fried chicken then san tung ..... only to be let down. (Unless you like orange chicken flavor) but San Tung is by far the best in SF!,"Worth the hype (and the wait). Wings were fantastic and tasted similar to the """"Asian Zing"""" flavor at BWW except this time", the skin was still crispy and the flavor a little less spicy. The black bean noodles were also excellent and quite decadent. The shrimp chive dumplings were..... actually just average. Would have been better off without that. Service was excellent and everything went well. Food: 8/10 Service: 7/10 Vibes: 5/10 Value: 6/10,Love their chicken wings! This place is very fast paced, service is fast and food comes out good. Ambiance is loud but it's a good time when you eat good food.,Wow this place serves the best fried chicken I've ever put in my mouth. The crunch and the flavors and the stickiness of the sauce all work so perfectly together to create a flavor party on my tastebuds. We came here for lunch and got the lunch special twice cooked pork (which comes with soup and rice) and a regular order of 12 dry fried wings. There's usually a line of people waiting to be seated, so just go in and write your name on a whiteboard to get in line. We waited ~20 min for Friday lunch, but I imagine it might get busier on weekends.Pro tip: Go for weekday lunch for the lunch special! Order one lunch special and the regular size for the wings because it's much more value (12 wings for $16.50 vs 6 wings + soup/rice for $12.50) and they gave us an extra soup and rice!,Took my mom today to her favorite Fried Chicken place for lunch. She liked their crispy and sweet Fried Chicken, Vegetarian Mu Shu and Dry Sautéed String beans. This is her must ordered menu. Lol!!! She loved it. We came here around 11:03am by that time it was almost half full. Customer service is good, price and portions are decent. :) :)Recommend: totally yes yes yes!!!!!!!,A go to spot in San Francisco, never unsatisfied coming here. Came here for dinner and pretty close to opening, but there was already a line. We waited around 10 to 15 minutes and got seated.  Service is pretty fast and very friendly. We ordered the Vegetarian Black Bean Noodle, Chicken Wings, String Beans, Twice Cooked Pork and Vegetarian Fried Rice. The black bean noodles, chicken wings and string beans are a must and I get it whenever I come. It is pretty hard to find parking here, so you would have to drive around a couple times or park a few blocks away.,A visit to San Tung is incomplete until you order the original dry fried chicken. These chicken wings (12 per order) are deliciously seasoned with garlic, ginger, and just enough roasted red peppers to add a slight kick that even my friends with a very low spice tolerance can still enjoy. When you bite into each wing, you instantly hear the slight crunch of the outer deep fried layer followed by juicy, tender meat inside. I'm craving some more of these chicken wings even just thinking about them now! Along with the dry fried chicken, I usually also get the dried sautéed string beans and a noodle dish. Although there usually is a line to dine in, the line usually moves fairly fast, especially if you're in a small group and don't mind sharing a large lazy Susan table with others. I've also noticed that the wait time is shorter for lunch than dinner. Either way, the dry fried chicken is one of the few things worth waiting in line for!,If you haven't gone to San Tung yet for their chicken wings, what are you even doing? It's like one of thee best places to get their chicken wings and I think anyone can attest to that. It's their bread and butter and it makes San Tung what it is today. Luckily, I've been growing up eating here my whole life before it blew up even more till this day. But if you come, be warned because the lines are insane. Every day is a hustle and it's understandable because of how popular this place isAnyone who comes here has to order their wings. You don't even need to specify anything, just say chicken wings and that's it. It's like soaked in this dark sticky savory/spicy sauce that's so addicting and I even use the chicken sauce for the other things I order on the menu. I like putting it on my dumplings for that extra mph of umami flavor.Other things I usually order are their black bean noodles, the sizzling rice soup, the pork dumplings, and the next most important thing, their string beans. I think they have one of the best tasting string bean dishes I have ever tasted. That, their black bean noodles, and their chicken wings are a must whenever I come. I think it's totally worth the drive. Even if you don't have the time to come wait and sit in the restaurant, you can even just order their wings specifically to go and that's like literally the only thing you need to satisfy your San Tung needs. Since I grew up eating here since I was a kid, I don't really crave this place anymore, but I can still attest that this place has a great a reputation for their food and I highly recommend coming here if it's your first time!,Service is super fast, but more importantly is the crew seat you fast, there is a white board on the wall and you can see every 5 to 10 minutes the crew clean the names and write new group of people on it.The portions are huge and generous. I am impressed by the fast and organized service they give. The restaurant is a small room maybe 50 seats and 8 to 10 tables. However, you may see that people respect each other . No one stands on top of each other's table to grab it.It was a great experience and I will be back .,Went just before opening on a weekend with a group of 6 and we were able to be seated immediately. Service was extremely quick and attentive. The chicken wings were definitely everyone's favorite dish - as expected. We also had the hot and sour soup, honey walnut prawns, green beans, Mongolian beef, jajangmyeon (black bean noodles), and rice. The least favorite dish among all of us was the jajangmyeon. We've all had this dish before and agreed the one served at San Tung had a more mild bean paste flavor and overall lacked flavor although the quality of the noodles was pretty good. I would order the chicken wings, green beans, and honey walnut prawns again.,Absolute must-try in SF! I always get the fried chicken, string beans, black bean sauce noodles, and pork dumplings and it hits the spot every time! The fried chicken isn't too spicy. It can get busy during peak hours so I recommend coming early or on a weekday so you're not waiting too long.I recently came back with a group of friends on a weekday. Coming at 5:30pm on a weekday for a group of 8 was a good idea since we got seated immediately. Street parking is usually available but may be more difficult during peak hours. Items ordered: Original Dry Fried Chicken - San Tung's signature dish and it does not disappoint! The sauce is really thick and a little spicy but also sweet. Dry Black Bean Noodles - These noodles hit the spot every time and come with so much flavor and sauce. Fried Bean Curd - Came with veggies and tofu in a thick sauce and it was so yummy. Can never go wrong with tofu and veggie dishes!Green beans - Another signature dish which always has so much flavor and is cooked well. Pork Fried Rice - Pretty simple but still so delicious! Compliments the other dishes well. I have also ordered for take out and it has always been a good experience, dine in or take out. Call ahead to order take out and give around 20-30 min for small orders and up to 1 hour for a larger order. They ask for your card over the phone so you pay before you hang up. Highly recommend trying if you're ever in the area!,#NAME?, there were ~20 groups in front of us and ~5 groups got cleared every 10 minutes (write name on whiteboard inside)- can also order takeout to skip the line- standard chaotic, loud, and fast-pasted chinese restaurant ambiance, but i find it comforting - given hot tea, but could probably ask for water if you wanted it- have vinegar, soy sauce, chili oil, and chili sauce for you to make your own dip- shrimp and leek dumplings: pretty good and a good size, nice filling:dumpling skin ratio- black bean sauce noodles: noodles were a good thickness and chewy, the sauce was well seasoned and not too heavy. also got a good amount of meat/seafood in the mix- dry fried chicken wings: SUPER crispy, the batter and fry were really well done, but the star was definitely the sauce! it was thick and glossy and sticky and sweet with a very slight heat to it, and just coated the wings so well. definitely worth the hype - good food at a pretty good price point considering it's sf, so would definitely recommend checking it out,Somehow we never ate here when we lived in SF but finally made it on a recent trip back. We went on a Thursday at noon and there was a short 15 min wait once we put our names on the dry erase board/waitlist.Dry chicken wings, string beans, and black bean noodles were all delicious and service was surprisingly great, especially considering the type of service we were expecting for a hole-in-the-wall Asian restaurant. I've heard the prices have gone up but haven't prices gone up everywhere? It's delicious here, just go.,Our family loves San Tung!!There is a reason the line is always out the door and the phone is always ringing! Their original fried chicken is what draws people to this restaurant. If you're not coming right when they open, expect to wait at least 30-40 minutes to be seated. I will say it is worth the wait!,It's been years since I've dined in here, and it did not disappoint! We lucked out and found residential parking, then when we got in only waited for about 10 min til we sat down and ordered. Best tip I can give is to go on weekdays and during lunch if possible! We arrived around 1230 with no issues. Once seated, tea is already hot and steeped and our food came out within 15 min, steaming hot and so delicious! Definitely a favorite local spot in the Bay for chicken wings, and will be back and hungry for more!!!,One of my fave places every time I visit SF! It definitely gets really busy so I recommend going right when they open or ordering take-out. The service is great, they are very quick and the food also comes out very fast. I definitely recommend if you've never tried this place before!Dry Fried Chicken - Must try! The fried chicken is unmatched here, the sauce is so delicious and the chicken is so crispy!Pork Dumplings - Yummy! The dumplings are soft and juicy, very good!Black Bean Sauce Noodles - Amazing! This dish is so good, and you can tell how fresh the sauce is (it doesn't taste artificial or powdery).Dried Sautéed String Beans - Delicious! You can never go wrong with string beans. They were perfectly seasoned and so delicious with rice.,The dry chicken wings...a MUST order. I had to restrain myself to 4 pieces because I had to share.....um next time I'm ordering a whole order for myself and am not sharing! Crispy and perfectly cooked then dipped in the most savory, slightly sweet sauce.  Addictive! This family owned business packs them in daily except on Tuesday's and Wednesday when they are closed. They opened at 4:30 and we arrived at 5:05pm and we were number 8 in line for a table.  The eggplant with garlic sauce and the mushu beef were my favorites along with the chicken wings. They are also well known for their handmade noodle dishes. Service was surprisingly good given the non-stop crowds inside. The number of people waiting outside never went down either....Delicious...good portions, priced well, good service....I would go back again and again to this place!Street parking available.,Okay, worth the hype and the hour+ wait (during a sunny Saturday lunch rush), especially for the price.Easy queue process--just write your name and party size on a whiteboard just to the right of the entrance (inside), and they'll call your name. All the employees were working really hard to get people seated, tables cleared, and food served as fast as they could. Everything was served within 10 minutes of ordering, though our dumplings were comically misplaced for a few minutes (a lot of people order the same things), someone came to check and promptly got us the missing order.- Shrimp and leek dumplings (4.5/5): good sized spherical dumplings with a sturdy but thin wrapper and generous amount of shrimp and leek inside; make your own dipping sauce with soy sauce, chili oil, chili paste, and/or white vinegar- Black bean sauce noodles (5/5): a huge heaping of sauce on top of an equally huge mountain of noodles; plenty of protein (beef, shrimp, squid) hidden in the sauce along with onions, potatoes, and cucumbers; beware the long and slippery noodles when serving - Original dry fried chicken, 12 piece wings (4.5/5): the famous chicken, super crunchy on the outside even after being drenched in the sweet, salty, tangy, and STICKY sauce; I would say the sauce is a bit too salty for my taste and definitely settles into a sticky mess after cooling, so eat with haste (':This place hits different dine-in compared to take-out (which I tried during shelter-in-place). The bustling atmosphere and almost deafening chatter can be overstimulating but is also kind of fun.. the piping hot food is also such a plus.,Ordered: Dry Fried Chicken, Potstickers A San Francisco star!! The chicken here is absolutely the best! Served with 12 pieces, the chicken is fried perfectly and doused in a spicy sweet sauce that gets you to come back for more. Could be eaten with rice or alone, regardless, it's still really good. The potstickers are filled with pork and cabbage and seasoned more on the peppery side? They're really big and come out piping hot from being fried. I would mostly recommend the chicken though. Overall, will definitely come back to try more!,We ordered 3 dishes: black bean sauce noddles, famous fried chicken wings, and twice cooked pork. So many people recommended this place and I finally gave it a try today. The chicken wings are not bad, but you can just have it in a lot of Korean restaurant. It is good," but it didn't give be the """"wow"""" moment. The black bean sauce noodles were not bad either", I liked it's taste, not too salty and not too sweet. I had to add a bit spicy sauce to accelerate the flavor. Ok, DO NOT order twice cooked pork. The pork was tender, but it didn't have any the flavor you would want in the dish under the name. It is different than Sichuan style. For the northern style of Chinese cuisines, there are so many in the city, this one is not bad by any means, but it wasn't too impressive either. May come back if I crave the noddles.,Have heard a lot about this place since I moved to the Bay and had some pretty high expectations. I thought the shrimp and leek dumplings were great, perfect dough and ratio inside. The dry friend beef was a favorite, got a little too saucy at the end but the beef stayed crispy throughout. The black bean noodles were great! So much seafood in it, and the noodles were cooked perfectly. I do think it could've been a little more flavorful but still good. The chicken wings were not what I expected...they were very sweet and very crunchy but in a good way! They were a lil spicy for me but I'm weak lol. Would come again, but probably not within the same 6 months if that gives you an idea of my opinion LOL,San Tung's is good as always. We waited about 45 minutes (no surprise), but food came quickly once we were seated. Our Dry Rub Chicken Wings were piping hot when we arrived and just as good as I'd always remembered. Service was good and they were surprisingly very attentive - they refilled our cups of water a few times (which is kinda rare for a Chinese restaurant, in my experience). The Sizzling Rice Soup was interesting! I was excited to try it as it's not super common at Chinese restaurants. I don't quite know how they prepare it before they bring it to you, but it LITERALLY sizzles as they drop it into your soup!! I would compare the texture of the rice to popped popcorn (lol).It was on the pricey side for Chinese food, but San Tung is always a solid spot for great food.,Very good food be prepared to wait these guys are in high demand.  Parking is a big challenge so unless your lucky plan on walking at least two blocks but the food is worth it.,Dry fried chicken wings (3/5) fried well but the sauce is a sticky mess. Flavor was sweet and sticky. It wasn't as great as reviews made it seem. Black bean sauce noodles (3.5/5) I'm a sucker for this dish. The noodles were very long and fresh. Five spice beef noodle (3/5) simple beef noodle soup. I totally forgot it was supposed to be 5 spice because it was semi bland. Maybe we were given the wrong dish?Green beans (4/5) classic dish and tasted about right.,San Tung absolutely lives up to the hype & is worth the line. Our party of 5 waited about 45 minutes for a table on a Sunday around 7 pm. We thought about just ordering food to go but we decided to wait it out for a table and we are so glad that we did. Eating the food while it was hot and crispy was SUCH A GOOD CHOICE and the service was also fantastic. We started with the sizzling rice soup, which was the perfect starter on a chilly SF night. We then shared the honey walnut shrimp (best I've had anywhere), the shrimp fried rice (so flavorful!), the black bean noodles (incredible), the cherry pork (delicious) and their famous original dried fried chicken (which was absolutely phenomenal). Literally every dish that came out was better than the last. The sauce on the original dried fried chicken is sweet & hot, but definitely not too spicy. It was hands down the best chicken we've ever had. The cherry pork was also SO GOOD, unlike anything we've ever had before. We left here full & happy. Such a great SF gem, we will remember this meal for a long time. Highly recommend.,We ordered their very well known dry fried chicken wings, shrimp & leek dumplings, sautéed green beans, and chicken chow mein!It was our first time at San Tung, where we've heard all about the raving reviews on their Chinese chicken wings, so we had to try it out!These chicken wings were doused in a delicious spicy sweet sauce! Of all Chinese chicken wings we've ever had, these are the best! Their shrimp & leek dumplings were super flavorful compared to how they look (trust me). The green beans are a must have because they are also doused in their sauce!!! We thought that the chow mein was ok and pretty standard - definitely had better.FYI, the wait is usually long so, definitely get a takeout order (call ahead) but we were lucky by only waiting 30 minutes for lunch on a Saturday!Chinese fried chicken wings are not the same as Korean btw! We love our Korean chicken wings!!,San Tung is a classic Chinese restaurant that I could picture my mama and yaya (the Cantonese way of saying grandparents) taking us to for a family celebration! Although I don't live in SF, the hour drive was worth it to finally come and try these wings that were being raved about on TikTok! I got the wings to go by phone order and the hardest part of the pickup process was finding parking! Once I got the bag, I instantly knew that these wings coated in the sticky, sweet, and spicy sauce were going to be addictive! As a girl who can't handle much spice, I was definitely sweating while eating these but it was so worth it and definitely one of the locations that I love to show my friends! If you're in the area and getting these wings, be sure to bring some wet wipes, extra napkins, and even a tide to-go pen because it can get messy! Can't wait to be back soon!Follow my food adventures and reviews @kristeatsfood on Instagram!,Got the wonton soup to go since it was really cold outside. Nice and simple meal but there was not as much flavor to the broth or much vegetables in the soup. The wings are really yummy so I will just stick to that next time.,Big. claps. for. this. place. This is comfort chinese/korean (ish) food. It's a little oily overall but that's what comfort chinese food is. We came on a Saturday and didn't have to wait too long. To put your name down, you go in and there's a white board right next to the door. There are 40 slots lol to put your name down and they erase the slots as they seat people. I do think they have an efficient system but for a restaurant with that much demand, you'd be surprised by how small this place is for a chinese spot. Yes, i keep saying chinese even though they're technically chinese korean bc I'm not convinced it's really that korean (minus maybe the way they do their chicken wings).Things we had:Dry fried chicken wings - So when people say dry fried," i typically think of the fried pepper chicken wings you get at a chinese restaurant. These are not really """"dry"""" They are over a very THIC sauce of honey and soy with a caramel/honeycomb-esque glaze around the chicken wing. You literally feel the crunch as you bite down into the chicken wing. I'm not a fried chicken fan and this i can get behind.Green Beans - Slightly above average sauteed chinese style string beans. They are above average because you really feel the wok flavor. It comes out piping hot!Shrimp & Leek dumplings - Thin skin", good filling ratio, what more can you ask for? Note: the white communal sauce dispenser is their vinegar. They don't have red vinegar.Crispy rice soup - I love that this comes in S,M,L. The S is honestly enough to feed 2 people 3 mini bowls of soup. When they pour the crispy rice, you can hear the sizzle. Delish.Overall, I would definitely come again. I am curious what else to get from here though because I feel like the items I ordered were all their famous dishes.

I get the Chicken Wings here like everyone else . Such a great place to bring friends and family from out of town.  Call ahead and pick up your food and eat it somewhere else if the line isn't your thing. I've picked up party tray's from here many times as well.If spice isn't your thing you can ask for them to be """"non spicy/no peppers"""".The chicken wings are such a requirement here that when I've seen a table that doesn't have chicken wings on them (gasp..i know) I try to discern if they are from out of town and try to work in a conversation that they need to order the wings.....lolThis place is always a safe place to take friends and family from out of town.Business is very very good here. Put your name on the list if you see a line. It would be nice if they implemented a texting-wait service like they do at some of the other venues in town now. If you've been coming here for years like I have you'll notice and be familiar with most of the servers here.  Since it's so busy you have to flag down people here often but they are cool and manage the """"stress"""" well.For your out of towners save some money on lyft/uber and take the muni N Judah  train from downtown and it will drop you off a short walk from here.If you like my reviews"," consider """"following"""" my profile for reviews all across the SF Bay Area . Why """"follow"""" someone?  It causes the person you follow's reviews to tier to top when you pull up a business. I find this very handy when researching venues. Rod's Review grading scale explained. Essentially I personally base it on the likelihood of a return visit and I try to be stingy with 5 star reviews since they should be """"special"""" in my eyes. Price/Value also play a role obviously but there are $ and $$$$ littered across my grading scale. 5 stars - """"I'll go out of my way"""" (approx 6 % of my reviews)  4 stars- """"If I was in the area I'd go here and would recommend"""""," (approx 38% of my reviews)  3 stars """"Maybe if was nearby"""""," (approx 37% of my reviews) 2 stars -""""Would likely not return"," Only if you want to go"""""," (approx 16% of my reviews)  1 star -""""No thanks"," even if I was hungry""""", (approx. 3 % of my reviews),*It's definitely a mission to get to this locations, finding parking, and sometimes waiting up to an hour. However, it's been worth it each time. Their chicken wings are phenomenal, as well as their string beans and black bean noodles. Many places make their string beans way too salty for my liking but San Tung makes it so that its not overwhelmingly salty with a hint of sweetness. *Service was not bad. However, sometimes they do seem too busy and that's when service goes a little down.*The building itself is relatively small. It's slightly compact and gives off an atmosphere like every other busy/hectic Dim Sum/Chinese restaurant.,Not me driving all the way from Richmond hoping that they'd  be open :'(. Oh well, next time!,A prime spot in SF, San Tung really is a must-visit. We came 30 mins after opening and waited about 1.5 hours. You sign your name on this whiteboard and that's the list. Tables are set for parties 4 and under or 5 and over so you may get lucky if you come with a bigger group. They also do takeout where you can order there or online. You are seated with a pot of jasmine tea. We ordered the famous chicken wings, staple green beans, shrimp and leek dumplings, and the black bean noodles. All were delicious and we had plenty of leftovers (like a whole extra meal) for the next day. Service is quick, know what you want. They wanna serve you and move you on out, it's the beauty of an Asian restaurant.,Wow we came at 4:26pm on a Sunday to get ahead of the long lines and came in to see the restaurant was already 95% full. We happened to grab the last available 2 person table thankfully. Otherwise you'd put your name and number of ppl on a whiteboard list to wait for the next table.Fast service given how busy they are. We got ice water and hot tea while browsing the menu. Ordered dry chicken wings, beef soup noodle, and the shrimp and leek dumplings. DRY CHICKEN WINGS - lives up to the hype. Hot and tender inside, not too spicy not too sweet but addicting; I couldn't stop eating this. My friend isn't a huge fan of sweet and sour or syrupy wings or spicy meals but he loved this. Def worth a try.SHRIMP AND LEEK DUMPLING - I love leek or chives dumplings (came with 12 pieces) and they tasted as expected (but I think I prefer the chives dumplings from good mong kok heh)BEEF SOUP NOODLES - NOT the Taiwanese beef noodle soup. A Chinese version which for me brings me back home. The broth was lovely - not too salty and very filling. Noodles were great and the beef and veggies were plentiful! All three dishes were more than enough for 2 - we had a decent amount of leftovers to go.,DRY FRIED FLOUNDER is the only thing worth the wait for. IF YOU WANT CHICKEN WINGS without waiting, just go across the street to Chang's kitchen, they taste almost identical!! The dry fried flounder is fluffy, delicate, and delicious. However the fish is rather thick, so I suspect it's not real flounder and a substitute fish instead. Regardless it is really good!!The dry fried chicken wings can be passed if you're getting the flounder. The wings are dryer inside than the fish is, hence I recommend the fish over the wings.,San Tung has to be one of my favorites restaurants overall  in the bay.I love Wings and fried chicken ,so when I heard about their wings from a friend I knew I had to try. My first visit to San Tung was during the Covid epoch. We ordered the wings and as soon as we got in the car we devoured a full order of the wings. We loved them so much that we got back out the car to order them again. The person in the store laughed and said your back already ? My love story with San Tung was written at first bite as soon as my chompers hit that fried goodness it was on ! Man this place has to have some of the best wings I've had. My last visit I had to opportunity to sit in and enjoy some incredible food and excellent service. The staff was friendly, kind, and helpful which is a huge plus ! Every time the wifey and I go we go big and order way too much food haha. Family favorites are the wings, soup dumplings, shrimp and leak dumplings, hot and sour soup, and the beef and broccoli dish.,We came here just for the chicken wings - they are good and a safe choice for Chinese food if youre ever in sunset!I remember growing up these were the best wings there is but now they just dont have the same kick- it tastes sweet yet a bit too peppery. The dumplings are a pass though. We came on a Wednesday night for dinner and the rush started around 7:30. We got lucky and didnt have to wait too long but the party that came right after us didnt get seated until we were halfway done with our meal.,Yummy China Sun Tong region cuisine.I tried almost half of the menu, can't find anything I don't like.Prices have increased + $6-7 each dish of noodles and ala carte.Long lines as usual.1+ hour wait if you come during peak..,We were 9th on the whiteboard which only was about a 30 minute wait.. not too bad for a Saturday night at 7pm.We had pot stickers, eggplant, the original chicken and peanut sauce noodles.The fiancé loved the peanut sauce noodles.The chicken is worth the hype: best I've had in SF. Being from Buffalo, NY these could be served in the home of wings.,I've been hearing about San Tung's dry fried chicken wings for years.  The problem is I don't go to San Francisco very often, let alone this part of the city.But we had to go to run an errand in SF one day, so we decided to tack on a food tour and hit up a few of the places we've heard about but haven't been to.We ordered the wings with the sauce on the side, and waited 15 minutes for them to be made. The chicken without the sauce is nothing special, but they become magical once drenched in the sauce - hot, sweet, and spicy!This is one of the rare times that the hype matched reality, so we'll definitely be back for the wings!,So yummy. My friend and I shared the chicken wings and the green beans. I think the best chicken wings I've ever had--perfectly crispy, sweet, and spicy. Green beans were too sweet in my opinion. Two dishes were enough to fill us up. I saw a lot of people also eating the black bean sauce noodles; I will be trying that next time. Super long wait. If you don't mind sharing a table with other people, let the host/hostess know and your wait could be shorter.,The prices on Yelp are way off. Example: $14.00 for Shrimp Curry. On website it's $21.00. That's a huge difference. Same for all other dishes. I spent $64.12 for two dinner dishes, rice and vegetarian egg rolls.  It should have been no more than $45.00 before taxes. San Tung change your Yelp menus or its a scam. I will not return. That's bad business. Wake up consumers to your rights. We have them. And yes I saw their disclaimer on Yelp. But I think if there is a difference that is above $5.00 then update the Yelp menu. Also note the website menu does not have everything they have on Yelp.,San tung lives up for their famous honey fried chicken, their most popular menu item. I've seen so many friends go to San Tung for just the fried chicken, totally hyped up for and worth it if you're a bone in chicken wings fan. My friend and I were in the area and we were craving lunch after a long walk at the park. We went around 4:30pm on a Saturday afternoon, surprisingly no wait at all to grab a table. We were debating between takeout or dine in, then we got ushered to sit at the table. Ohwhale. It was a regular Chinese restaurant experience. Waiter took our order fairly quickly, decent customer service, not anything fancy. WHAT WE ORDERED Honey fried chicken Their famous fried chicken. It was thick, glazed with honey and spices, just a different take on bone-in fried chicken. Jiajiangmian (black bean noodles) Not your typical jiajiangmian for sure. This dish had scallops, seafood, minced pork and julienned cucumbers. It was a refreshing take on the regular jiajiangmian. I'll definitely come back for more chicken wings,Stopped by on a Friday lunch and the wait was fairly short - we put our name on the whiteboard and in 5 minutes we're called to be seated. We were curious to try a lot and ordered 4 dishes - definitely too much for 2 people as we had so much leftover to eat as dinner! The chicken wings were fine, a little too sweet for my liking. The black bean noodles taste good but it was really hard to share because the noodles were all tangled and long (def recommend this as a one-person dish as opposed to sharing family style). My favorite were the string beans, but again, they were a bit too sweet for my liking.,First time trying here. Everything was really really good. I was especially impressed by their dry black bean noodles -- perfect balance of flavors. I liked that the sauce wasn't overly greasy or sweet. The somewhat dry noodles also worked well with the sauce. Often times blackbean noodles can be really glutinous and heavy to eat-- but this wasn't! The wings were amazing as well. They were drenched in sweet (slightly spicy) sauce but still maintained its crispiness. Jjamppong was good too. Not as compelling as the black bean noodles but it's always good to have something soupy on the side. They had large chunks of seafood that were very fresh and cooked just right. Overall, will definitely come back to try their other dishes too!,Always-a-must dishes: -Sauteed Green Beans -Original Fried Chicken Wings (warning, it does have a little kick to it, but if    you can eat siracha, you'll be fine) -Black Bean NoodlesWarning: wait time can be long; try calling in an order. Sometimes they don't call you when your order is ready so keep track of the time and check in with them,Stuck it out through the god awful SF traffic and came here TWICE because we love the food so so much! We ordered take out both times and I can't tell you how it is when eaten fresh, but even up to 25 minutes in the car, these wings are ADDICTING. Perfectly, fried, abundant flavor, I'm a happy happy girl. They also have the best Jajamyeon noodles I have ever had and I used to think I didn't like black bean noodles but now I know I've just had nothing good up until this point. A staple in SF and must try.,Best wings in the Bay! Hands down! I'm not a fan of driving into the city, but I've sat in rush hour traffic to get their wings.,Many years ago, my first time here was with a dear teacher of mine. She have passed since. And I have brought my friends and family along to enjoy their food through out the years. During the pandemic, I didn't come here as I live across the city. But recently, I got the chance to enjoy dining in again with some friends. Service is just as great and fast as I remembered it. Food taste amazing as it every did before. Must have is the sweet spicy chicken wings. Ordered some dumplings and meat dishes. Couldn't take all the photos of food. We ate as the dishes came out, hands were busy flying across each other.,Overall good for the prices were great. We had 3 entrees and 2 apps for 5 which worked out well. By far my favorite was the flounder ! It was very good, but for sure not something you could eat a ton of, it is converted in sauce which is delish but a lot. I really love that they give you hot tea at the table. Only down side is that I have a gluten free friend and our waiter didn't know what was gluten free on the menu. DONT COME HERE UF U HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES,I probably had San Tung 10+ years ago, so it has definitely been a long time since I had their food.We decided to grab some of their famous wings as a snack. It was hot, crispy, and delicious! Definitely worth all the hype.Ordering was a bit of a pain though. When we got there, you could only order online or on the phone. They did not allow you to order in-person.We also didn't get any confirmation that our order went through. Took awhile for the food to come out as well," but still...worth the wait!Parking is a bit tough like the rest of SF.@shoyuthebest on IG!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dumpling Home,"We were so pleased to get a last minute reservation that had about an hour wait at 1 pm. There was plenty to go do in the area in the meantime. We had another bit of a wait for the food to come dish by dish. The mushrooms in a vinaigrette blew us away! They keep me talking about it to this day. We also highly enjoyed the juicy pork bao. Great dining experience.,Amazing food and efficient service.  Can't go wrong with ginger and green onion noodles!,Food was Delicious! Was hesitant to try the wonton soup; but it was one of the best I've tried. Will definitely go back, when in town.,Came here on a Sunday night around 6:30pm. We put our name down on the waitlist on the iPad inside and the wait was about 30 minutes, but the food was worth every minute! We weren't too hungry so we ordered the chicken xlb, the 4pc juicy pork bao, and the dry zha jiang noodles and it was a good amount of food for 2!- Chicken xiao long bao - delicious, juicy, and even better when dipped in the ginger soy! This is a solid option if you're looking for a classic XLB to satisfy your dumpling cravings.- Juicy pork bao - a must try!! These were my personal favorite and I saw everyone around us ordering them as well. The outside was half soft and half crunchy which was new for me, and the inside was so tasty and the soup was hot and full of flavor.- Dry zha jiang noodles - pretty good, but I wasn't as impressed as I was by the other two dishes. The flavors all came together really nicely and I appreciated a simple noodle dish to finish off our meal. My friend said it is usually served hot though, and ours was pretty cold by the time we got it so I think that made a difference as well.It is a bit on the pricey side, but I would definitely come back especially for the juicy pork baos and would be interested in trying some other dishes as well!,the best pork pan fried soup dumplings in sf imoi've tried their other dishes - they're ok, but at this point i only get multiple orders of their pork pan fried soup dumplings and nothing else lmao.,Wow I didn't take pictures of someOf the best dishes here.We waited a while supposedly, but luckily a friend lives nearby so it wasn't so badThere are a lot of Chinese restaurants in the Bay Area, so I think to warrant a high rating it really requires you to stand out in a certain field :At this restaurant I felt it was their xiao long bao -- especially their mala and crab xiao long baos which I found particularly tasty and juicy.The sheng Jian bao was pretty good, and I quite liked the Dan Dan noodles and the beef rolls too. Those would be my re-orders.I'm a fan of pig ears so I quite liked those too.We also got the beef noodle soup but not entirely sure I'd order it again. Though it wasn't bad, there's definitely places you can go for better.The boiled dumplings we got -- had shrimp and chives, but I'd say this was my least favorite dish here.Besides the xiao long bao, I personally loved the Dan dan noodles but that's just because I love sesame paste. I would say everything else was good or ok -- not something you could never find anywhere. That being said, I think the xiao long bao makes it all worth it here.,Dumpling Home gets crowded in a Friday evening! On weekends, you're unable to make reservations and seating is done on a first come first serve basis. If you miss first seating, you'll need to put yourself on the Yelp waitlist. I stopped by around 5:15 p.m. not long after they opened for dinner and my party of four ended up waiting close to 45 minutes before we were seated at a table.Between the four of us, we ordered virtually everything off of their menu listed under the popular items section, including XLBs, wontons, green onion pancakes, green beans, chicken wings, and ginger scallion noodles.The dumplings here are fantastic. The thinness of the wrapper is often used as the indicator as to how good a dumpling place is, and Dumpling Home does a stellar job: their wrappers are the perfect thickness to keep in all the juices. If you're coming with a small group and won't be ordering many items, I would recommend the baos over the XLBs, and the XLBs over the dumplings. Not many places in the city that make pan fried baos as good as they do here.If I were to stop by again, dishes I'd probably skip over are the green onion pancakes and the noodles. The green onion pancakes were on par with pancakes you'd find in the frozen section of Ranch 99 and the noodles were definitely overcooked (though the flavor was really good).,I've waited a long time to come here! The last 2 attempts, the line was way too long so we left. But--I came at 11:30am on a Thursday and was seated right away. The service was fast, restaurant clean, and waitress was attentive; unfortunately the food did not live up to my expectations. We got the:- juicy pork baos- pork XLB- wontons in spicy sesame/peanut sauce- dan dan noodles- green onion pancakesOur favorite was the juicy pork baos! Tasted like dumpling donuts with such a unique texture. Everything else was mediocre at best and the dan dan noodles, wontons, and onion pancakes were at room temp instead of freshly hot? Disappointing.,I am so grateful for more dumpling/dim sum spots outside of Chinatown, which is always chaotic to get to or try to find parking. Yep, there will be a wait, but fortunately this great location in Hayes Valley means plenty of places to grab coffee, boba, or an alcoholic drink while waiting. It's strange that they use the Yelp waitlist app for you to add your name, but don't enable the option online for you to join ahead of time. I came around 11.30 am aiming to be seated by 12.30 pm, because I knew my friends would be late. We were finally seated as a group of four inside around 1 pm.This will probably be one of the priciest dim sum brunches/lunches you will have. The portions are at least generous, and the quality of ingredients commensurate with the price. I wasn't bowled over by the taste of any particular dish or dumpling, but appreciated the novelty of the numbing/mala xiao long bao. My friend had the more standard/non-dim sum entrees and veggies, and said they were all delicious. For once, I didn't get tea with my dim sum. My friends all got the Thai iced tea and said that it was meh, but what can you expect ordering a Thai drink at a Chinese restaurant?I don't know if this is something that can ever be improved, but the biggest drawback was only one bathroom for the entire restaurant. There was a constant line, inside and out the door, and it's right next to the kitchen so it feels awkward to stand - but you can never trust you'll luck out being able to wait at the table for it to clear up and pop in.,10/10 food and here are my notes. Juicy pork bao and pork xiao long bao are classics and absolutely incredible here. They really emphasize the juicy in the juicy pork bao here as it's a unique half-crisped up dumpling with tons of juice squirting out (pause) so be careful when eating! The xiao long baos were pure class - the skin held together amazingly with so much soup juice, which had depth without being overbearing. The textures and flavors were wonderfully balanced!Green onion pancakes were a solid choice - nice and crispy and full of the scallion flavor. If you tryna switch it up wit some sweetness, the red bean paste pockets were kinda like the dim sum sesame balls but in crispy pancake form. Green beans were a good veggie side - nothing too crazy. The dried fried chicken wings were good but just OK to me and cannot be compared to the San Tung wings, but will suffice for those who haven't graced the shrine that is San Tung wings, but I digress. The ginger and green onion noodles were v tasty and the noodles had a great texture to them, though I wish there were some protein options to go with it. Major key alert: gotta come in person to put your name down on the waitlist - probably 15ish mins before your party arrives as this place was poppin on a Saturday night. Ambiance is v casual with indoor and outdoor seating and service is pretty average but the review still stands for absolutely incredible food. 10/10 will be coming back,Michelin Guide: Dumpling HomeHad a friend in town visiting from Boston and we decided to catch up over dinner at Dumpling Home. My friend is a vegetarian so all the courses we got were meatless. There was a long line when we initially got to the resturant, but we were seated pretty quickly.We got the vegetable bao, vegetable dumplings, and fresh cucumber with garlic sauce. I can see why this restaurant was on the Michelin guide. It was a very delectable dining experience. I was extremely satisfied with all the courses, and will definitely be back to try some of their meat portions when I return. The fresh cucumber with garlic sauce was probably my favorite. It was a simple dish, but the sauce and garlic made it perfect. It felt like the cucumbers had been soaked in the sauce for days the way the flavors exploded in my mouth. The dumpling skin was perfect, and the fillings inside as well. But beware! Don't bite too quickly into the vegetable bao or you may burn your mouth!,Went to dumpling home Thursday around 5:20 and had no wait to be seated! The inside was filled because they opened right at 5, but I was able to be seated in the patio right away. Normally there is a super long wait (no Yelp waitlist- you have to put your name down when you get there) so we were pleasantly surprised that we could be seated right away. Our waitress was super kind and friendly during the whole experience. We ordered the Pan Fried Pork Baos, Crab and Pork XLB, and Green Beans. Pan Fried Pork Baos are delicious and best eaten right away while the skin is still soft and supple. There is hot soup inside so be careful when eating these! I like to bite a small hole and drink the soup first before devouring the rest of the bao. The crab and pork XLB were probably my favorite. There is a very strong crab flavor, so if you're not a fan of ""fishy"" foods, maybe pass on this, but I enjoyed the crab taste and the thin dumpling skin. This is also something you want to eat quickly especially if you're sitting out in the SF cold. Green beans were classic Chinese green beans, garlicky, firm, and delicious!,Been disappointed by too many hyped up Chinese restaurants for bao but this one actually exceeded my expectations. 10000% recommend the sheng jian bao (juicy pork bao), it was a bit different on the outside compared to other sheng jian bao I've had but holy shit the amount of heavenly juice inside... beware when biting down bc mine projectile sprayed everywhere haha. The bottom is so perfectly crisp I simply enjoyed every single bite of this. Another fav was the Dan Dan noodles mainly bc the super chewy texture / freshness of the noodles was very unique, although it wasn't really spicy. Numb and spicy pork XLB was okay to me bc I honestly could not taste the spice at all and wasn't sure how regular pork XLB would be different. We waited 30 min around 12:15pm on a day where it was storming / flooding outside so get there early!,This place is absolutely worth the hype!!! We came around 12:20 pm and waited about 45 mins (not that bad) and it was totally worth it. We got: -juicy pork Bao -beef xlb -ginger green onion noodles -string beans -dry shrimp and chive pockets Everything was soo good. My favorite were the beef xlb and juicy pork baos. I've been looking all over sf for the perfect juicy pork buns and finally found it. This the baos were extremely juicy and the skin was super thin. This place was authentic and servers were very friendly and nice. If you're in the area I highly highly recommend trying it. I'll def be back with my parents!,Fave xlb place in the city. Hands down. Even approved by my super picky family members.XLB are so juicy & I mean soOOoooOO juicy. Skin is thin enough. Juicy pork baos are a must!Try a few items from the appetizer section to finish the meal. Personally, I skip the noodles so I can eat more XLB.,Had an awesome experience here this past Friday! To get on the waitlist, you need to physically be there. My brother went slightly early and put his name down and we met up with him. It took us about 30 mins to get a table (which honestly is a lot better than I expected)!Service was really fast! We ordered and started getting items really quickly. I highly recommend the green beans, chicken wings, green onion pancakes, and juicy chicken Bao. The only thing that was a miss for me was the chicken soup dumplings (chicken xiao long Bao). My fiancé said the pork version of this was really tasty so would recommend getting that instead (I don't eat pork so I got the chicken version instead). HIGHLY recommend,This is without a doubt the best dumpling place in San Francisco. Whenever people come to visit, they'll usually request a quick pit stop here. They've definitely iterated on their menu and take customer feedback very well, which is super rare, and as a result have truly stepped up to create the best quality. My main complaint, however, is the superr long lines. They don't do online yelp waitlist so you'll have to either come straight at opening time or be prepared to wander around hayes valley for an hour (not too bad since there's a ton of drink/dessert/shopping places nearby).My go-to's here are the pork and chicken xiao long bao. Trust me on the chicken - it sounds weird, but their chicken soup is so flavorful and it's so unique. You can't find this anywhere else but I personally find it to be a pretty homey twist on the classic. You also need to get the sheng jian bao (fried buns). These used to have a super thick dough and wasn't fried too well but they've improved it so that it's actually a thinner dough to filling ratio. Their cucumber salad and string beans are also my go-to appetizers. I wouldn't recommend trying any of their noodles though..they're nothing special and the dishes are super small so you don't really get your value.Would definitely recommend coming by if you're in the area. It's pretty reasonably priced for SF, and is definitely a fan favorite among locals.,This isn't a dumpling house; it's a dumpling home.Even on a Monday night, the wait is looong. You can put yourself on the Yelp waitlist once you arrive and then walk around Hayes. Since we waited around 45 min, we had a lot of time to check out the menu online and decide what to get. Between the two of us, we got the wings, ginger noodles, juicy pork baos, and pork XLB. Even though they brought out the food quickly, it did take a while to get the chance to order after being seated. My favorite was the juicy pork baos. ""Juicy"" is far from a cap. These things are JUICY. And delicious. Just make sure to be careful when biting into one. The xiao long bao were yummy too, and the wings and ginger noodles were good but nothing notable. For two people, our meal along with a small amount of leftovers came out to around $100. These dumplings definitely aren't cheap, but worth it for being located in a nice area.,I went to Dumpling Home for the sheng jian bao (pan-fried baos). They did not disappoint. Nor did the extremely authentic and well-done xiaolongbao.However, what truly stood out for me was the GREEN BEANS (四季豆). I'm literally an evangelist. The beans here are the gold standard. I compare takeout green beans to Dumpling Home's. I recommend this place to other Chinese folks -- literally just for the 四季豆 holy crap they are yummy.That said there are spots to note: long wait here, sometimes food comes cold inconsistently, the noodle dishes are just OK.But everything is forgiven...oh my gosh the beans they are so good!!!,I drive down gough all the time and always see a line at this restaurant so it must Good, right? Meh. Service was great even being at a parklet. I came in near closing time on a Sunday but imo, avoid peak hours I'm assuming morning to night on weekends.- foodoood -Beef tongue:  Was expecting a warm dish . None of the toppings really added much to make it better and it was a little hard( or am I just too use to it cooked in kbbq). Add the chili sauce for extraflavor. Tasted a little bland. 2.5/5Dan Dan noodles: not what I'm use to on the regular compared to going to Chinese family restaurants. Noodles didn't have that qq poppin taste and sesame sauce lack a bit of peanut butter wit the unmarianded meet. 2.5/5Pan fried bun with pork was overall my favorite dish. Xlb style with soup and meat pan fried, it was like a hot pot bite all in one with with the dip and addy chili oil. And did I mention that perfect crispy bite!  5/5Numbing xlb was a classic. Can't go wrong with it. Wasn't too spicy and just the right amount of broth. 4/5Boiled dumplings with pork's: wasn't too special, felt like something you can make at home 3/5Overall decent but of course we in dt vs ct and was it worth it? Ima have to stand with ct on this one. Can't beat the warm heart filling of dim sum at ct establishment. But I gotta add that this place is more well known for their pan fried dumplings.,This place is amazing! The pan fried dumplings have a cool shape like a cylinder. Really unique texture. Half of it is soft and the other half is crunchy. My personal favorites were the spicy xiao long bao and chili dumpling. They were so juicy and flavorful. And the spice adds a nice taste. The place itself if a bit small and quite popular so expect a long wait about an hour during meal time. Definitely worth it though.,This might be my new favorite restaurant... I have passed by this restaurant probably 50 times and seeing a long line thinking that a Dumpling place cannot be worth standing in line for an hour for, but I was wrong! It was a cold and rainy Sunday evening, and we arrive at 5:30 PM and had to wait about 45 minutes for a party of two. Chicken and shiitake mushroom dumplings - 4.5/5 These look very unassuming at first but the thick dumpling skin and tasty filling are very satisfying.  Fried green beans - 5/5 Again such a simple dish but very well done, the green beans are cooked to perfection between crispy and tender. They are extremely garlicky which I love.Green onion pancake - 2/5 these were extremely mediocre and had no seasoning or flavor to them. I wish they came with a sauce and were thicker so there was more layers of the pancake.*now the favorites*Numb and spicy pork Xiao long Bao - 5/5This is the dish that made me realize Dumpling home is special! The skin of the dumpling Is super thick and when you bite into the Dumpling in the inside is extremely juicy and well flavored.Juicy pork bao - 5/5These were the star of the show. I was surprised by the small size at first, But each piece packs a punch! I think it is nice that the bottom of the bao is crispy and the top is soft. These are almost like a soup dumpling, and that they have a lot of juice and meat in them. Will try to visit again very soon :),The best Xiaolong Bao and pan fried Bao in town!Little bit pricy but all worth it. I usually order to go to void the long wait, but Hayes valley also have a lot to explore. Will try to dine in one day if times allows.,If you can bear a long wait, Dumpling Home is so worth the visit. Came with a group of five and I think the wait was around 40 minutes or so. The place is quite small but man, are they serving up a storm of dumplings.We ordered a bunch of things as we were pretty freakin hungry. Some of my favorites were the Juicy Beef Bao, Pork Xiao Long Bao, Pork Dumpling with Sesame Sauce and Red Chili Oil, and the Green Onion Pancake. The Cucumbers and String Beans were also a good accompaniment to all the dumplings.Service is incredibly fast and efficient; they keep the orders coming out quickly, and all the dumplings are served steaming hot. The prices are also very reasonable for how filling and big most of the dumplings are.,We stumbled in and knew nothing about this place. It was right at 5pm on a Friday and the place was pretty empty.Little did we know that this place is amazing.I think we tried all the fan favorites.My wife absolutely loved the mochi dessert with peanuts and coconut. She is still thinking about it (it's been 2 days since) so definitely try the mochi as well.,This place is so good! I really enjoyed every item we got. Came here with a friend and we tried a couple of their dishes. - juicy pork buns/pan fried bun - omg this was so juicy! The soup inside the bun bursted out so be careful when you are biting into these! You were warned! - string beans - always a good idea and they make it well here too!- crab and pork xiao long bao - so good! Love the flavors and the soup inside the dumpling too- Dan Dan noodles - also so good! Attentive servers too and so friendly as well. Also loved the music playing as well! It was a lot of my older Chinese pop music like JJ Lin, Jay Chou, etc when we went and I loved it! Street parking with meters around the restaurant!,These 5 stars are for their Beef Brisket Noodle Soup which may be the best I've had in SF! We came back just to order this again!We ordered way too much, as their prices are quite fair! Crab and Pork XLB, Wood Ear Mushroom Salad (which is easy to make but it was really good), Spicy Pork XLB, etc. we're all great but the beef noodle soup stood out the most!,My cousin-in-law recommended this place. Highly recommend coming here a half hour before they open.  There is a line and the place is rather small.  They have outdoor seating but lately, it's been super cold and I like my dumplings piping hot.You will not be disappointed - their dumplings are so tasty and I love their vinaigrette.  I also like their side veggie dishes - cucumbers, okra, and string beans.The numb & spicy pork xiao long bao is friggen delicious.  I also don't think it's that spicy.  The crab & pork xiao long bao is also very tasty.  I think they're known for their pan-fried juicy pork bao.  If your first time visiting this spot, it's probably worth giving it a try but make sure to place your order right away as it takes at least 20 minutes to make.  I wasn't a fan of it not because it wasn't good but because it is.  Personally,  the wrapper was pretty chewy for my liking.Was not a fan of their sliced pig ear.Stick to the steamed baos and veggie dishes.  Such a good combo!,Always a line here so you know it's good. We lined up 5 minutes before it opened for dinner & 5 pm. And we're able to get seated right when they opened during the first wave. They don't take reservations it's first come first served. They have outdoor seatings w a few heaters ( I thought they could probably use one or two more outside-- it was cold), and they have limited indoor dining.  Service was pretty quick food was hot and fresh. There's a few key items we always order and are consistently good -- numb spicy XLB, juicy pork baos, beef pockets. We tried the beef brisket soup and thought it was just okay.... Soup wasn't hot and the meat was a-little tough and chewy -- not fall apart. Overall food is great service can be iffy and wait can be long but I think it's worth it !,We were seated almost immediately around 9pm. I didn't know this was place was an ~institution~ but it wasn't bad! We got the green beans, egg drop soup, green onion pancake, spicy XLB, and juicy pork bao. I would definitely stick to the baos and XLB. Most of the dishes weren't super fascinating, and the dumplings are definitely what you should order.The spicy XLB wasn't spicy, but the juice was super flavorful and umami. The meat had a very weak kick to it but was tender and paired well with the thin dumpling skin! The bao was also pretty crispy and thing with a juicy pork inner filling. I was impressed by the juicy bao!,Hands down has the best soup dumplings in SF! The broth was so flavorful, the dumpling skin was perfect! I also recommend getting the beef tongue boiled, it's tender, great sauce. The juicy pork bao had the perfect crisp, there was so much liquid when we took a bite of it. I would definitely skip the ginger and green onion noodles and dry shrimp and chives dumpling. Nothing too specialOhhh and make sure to try their hot chili paste! So homemade, garlicky and a favorite for sure!,This place is awesome if you're a fan of dumplings, especially the soup dumplings. We ordered the following: - Pork Xiao Long Bao (XLB) -- amazing flavors and each dumpling had lots of soup. - Spicy numbing pork XLB -- similar to the XLB, except that it had the Sichuan peppers oil with the soup. Was excellent also, although I personally preferred the regular XLB. - Juicy pork Bao (SJB). This was probably my favorite tied with the XLB. The outside was fried and crusty on one side and the soup inside was super hot (temperature not spice) when it came out so be careful. - Dan Dan noodles -- these were only so so. I would probably not order them here. They had a peanut sauce, which was okay. - boiled pork and sesame noodles -- were again just okay. They also had a  peanut sauce flavor similar to the Dan Dan noodles.- Beef tongue. Was outstanding. Loved the slight kick from the Sichuan peppers.The ambience is simple -- we sat outside with heaters on a cool winter day. The service was efficient. A definite 5 star. Will come again.,Surprised I haven't reviewed! We've gotten take out from Dumpling Home a few times now since we moved to Hayes Valley. We were told that take out is the way to go bc the service isn't always great. We've tried a number of the soup dumplings and bao! I'm not a huge soup dumplings gal they were good as were the bao! Will def be back.,Tik tok brought my friends and I here! It looked like a good place to eat on a chili day in San Francisco. Keep in mind the restaurant does close at 2:15 and we arrived at 1:30 so we had just enough time to eat. Also, this restaurant has a waitlist that you could join when you arrive, but there was no wait for us when we did. We ordered the juicy pork bao, dry fried chicken wings, and spicy pork XLB. Juicy pork bao: 10/10 Crispy texture, topped with green onions and the broth tasted great! Dry fried chicken wings: 8/10 Portion was 6 wings, sweet and savory, not spicy. Would get this again Dan Dan noodles: 7/10 The texture of the noodles were soft and moist, but the flavor was a little bland and wish it was a little spicier. Spicy pork XLB: 10/10 Our favorite one of all! It wasn't that spicy and this was my first time having spicy pork XLB since I always get the crab and pork one. It was juicy, flavorful, and we would get this again!,The best soup dumplings I've had in SF!! Been here a few times already and have tried:- pork soup dumplings (!! must try)- shrimp and loofah xlbs- scallop and wintermelon xlbs - juicy pork baos - shrimp, egg, and woodear mushroom xlbs All were good, but will keep coming back for the pork soup dumplings! the pork xlbs are wrapped with thin skin and filled with flavor and a spoonful of brothThe other soup dumplings felt more clean and refreshing, would probably skip out on next time The wait may be long so keep that in mind and try to arrive early - the line honestly moves pretty fast and service is pretty quick once you're seated,dumpling home, Hayes Valley SFMY FAVORITE DUMPLING PLACE EVER I love dumpling home so much that I wait 1 hr to eat it at least once a month  The juicy pork baos are the best I've ever had -- perfectly crispy on the bottom but still having a QQ bite with its thick bun. The xiaolongbao (soup dumplings) are also amazing, and the pork soup is so flavorful!We always order the green beans, and they're also phenomenal. I've also tried spicy wontons and noddles, but I would stray away from their noodle dishes since it's not their specialty.Even though the wait is long, the service is usually quite fast! Put your name down on the list and explore Hayes in the meantime :),Michelin-recommended dumplings and XLBs are a must-try! The fried buns are very interesting as well - crispy on the bottom and soft on the top. They offer different sauces for individual dishes, and small spoons to catch the juice. Love how detail-oriented they are. The inside is not that spacious so a lot of people were assigned to see outdoor with compact tables and chairs. Food is great while the seating is not very comfortable, but the price is legit and overall it is worth the wait!,Came here on Sunday at 11:30 right when they opened and was able to eat outside. It does get pretty crowded so I recommend coming when they open or earlier. Service was great! I got a lot of water refills and our waiter made sure we were taken care of. The food was excellent, but my favorite was the pan fried juicy pork bao, highly recommend! I would get more than the 6 I ordered next time since they were that good.,This is the best dim sum I've had in the Bay, out of the 10ish places I have tried. Ginger and green onion noodle: Amazing! Very savory, does not taste too strongly of ginger and has delicious fried green onions.Juicy pork bao: Favorite item! It really is juicy and such a unique take on the pork bao. That you can't find anywhere else.Pork XLB: Delicious! Very juicy filling, skin is quite thin. The only con is that there is usually a wait. I came another time on a sunday night and the line was more than 1 hour long :(,Best xiao long bao I've ever had (and I've had a lot). Detailed breakdown below:**Service, 3/5** Not the friendliest service -- we even got a snarky comment when one of the people ordered a noodle soup for themselves and we didn't use the bowls they brought out for sharing. They're efficient though -- our food came out pretty quickly.**Decor & cleanliness, 5/5** Super cute interior and even cuter dishes and plates.**Price & portion, 4/5** Kinda pricey for dumplings, but the quality is insanely good and makes it worth it.**Presentation of the food, 5/5** Gorgeous! **Taste of the food, 5/5**- Cucumber salad, 5/5: Big, crunchy pieces. Very refreshing and delicious with extra chili oil.- Pan fried crispy pork baos, 5/5: Such a flavorful filling with a chewy soft skin on top and crunchy bottoms. - Cabbage and pork dumpling, 5/5: Pillowy and filled with flavor! The wrapper is the absolute perfect consistency.- Beef noodle soup, 3/5: Meh compared to the dumplings -- broth is pretty light and doesn't have too much umami flavor.- Xiao long bao, 5/5: THE BEST XLB IVE HAD!! Silky wrappers, tons of piping hot delicious soup inside, and perfect ratios of meat to wrapper. They're also sturdy enough that among 3-4 orders, only one broke! **Other notes** There will be a huge wait. Try to come during off hours.,Dumping Home totally lived up to the hype! I suggest you go early though...we went at 5:30 on a Friday and were able to be seated right away outside. But by the time we were done eating around 6:30 there was a pretty big line already built up.I like everyone else really enjoyed the juicy pork buns, so much flavor! The beef soup dumpings were also packed with flavor. The garlic cucumber salad was great, packed a lot of garlic flavor. Scallion pancake was also good. Honestly the only thing I didn't love was the braised beef soup, was kind of bland for me but my friend loved it and at the whole thing.,Omg! An orgasmic culinary delight! Steamed. Fried. Boiled. Exquisite! We had various dumplings and each new one was my favorite. The okra side was fresh and fab. Don't miss this place!,I think I found the best pan fried pork buns in SF, or maybe even California! I had previously been to their sister restaurant, Dumpling Hours, which is located in Walnut Creek which I loved as well. However, I didn't expect TOO much since I thought it would taste the same. We came around 5:30 and it was already packed -- we ended up waiting for around 10 minutes before being seated. We ordered quite a few items -- green onion pancake, juicy pork buns, dan dan noodles, and potato salad. The scallion pancakes were good but expected. The potato salad was surprisingly delicious with a mala (numbing) flavor. I loved the chewy texture of the dan dan noodles and paired with the sesame sauce it created a great bite. Finally, as I mentioned, the juicy pork buns were definitely the star of the show. Perfectly crispy on the bottom, TONS of soup on the inside, and it was absolutely delicious. I could probably devour the entire plate of them if I wanted. DEFINITELY come here to try some of the best pork buns you will ever have!! Everything else is also really good and you can't go wrong, but if theres one thing you need to get its these. Highly highly recommend!!,This place has a line before they even open and with good reason!The XLB is so so but the spicy XLB is so much more flavorful! I really enjoyed it and its not spicy!The green beans are a side dish tha",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 you can never go wrong with ordering, although we expected there to be more than was served ...The pleasant surprise of it all was the pan fried pork baos. So juicy! As for ambiance, I'd suggest sitting inside if there's an option to. It's on an busy street so it can get loud lol,Got here at 5 right when they opened and got seated immediately. The excellent:- pan fried pork buns (be careful, it's HOT)- xiao long baoThe good:- seaweed egg drop soupThe inedible:- wonton in chili/sesame sauceThe juicy pork buns and Xiao long bao we're so incredibly juicy. The broth was piping hot so I burned my mouth a few times because I was impatient. Super flavorful. The XLB had a thicker, chewier skin than DTF but not in a bad way. Definitely would recommend. The wontons were the worst I've had anywhere... It was so inedible that we all tried a piece and didn't finish our bites. Everything else was fine! But I'd definitely just go back for the pork buns and XLB. Service is good. The ladies working there are all very nice. $$$$ as it was $16 for 8?,The best Soup Dumplings and Pan Fried Baos in SF.  I would say its the best in the bayarea.  I got to try many of their soup dumplings and all of them were delicious but my favroite is the classic, pork.  Skin is thin and the soup is sweet.  And OMG, their Juicey Pork Baos are the best. So much flavor and the soup inside is amazing.  The skin is cripsy, it's just perfect.  Reminds me of Asia, its that great.  Those two are the must order.  I also like the green beans, pot stickers and jelly fish.  I know the wait is long but I never had to wait because I like eating dinner early.  Getting there at 530pm is perfect.  There was a time, where I sat down at 530pm and left when they closed the kitchen.  The bill was huge but it was the best time.  I come once a month, truly the best!  Plus they play classic Hong Kong music, I love you even more.,Joined waitlist in person at around 1:30pm on a Friday, and was seated around 2:05pm. My friend and I shared the dry-fried chicken wings, zha jiang noodles, shrimp and loofah xiao long bao, and juicy pork bao. Every single dish was AMAZING! I like how they don't just have one signature dish that is amazing and everything is meh. Every dish blew me away. The juicy pork bao had delicious soup inside with a crispy bottom, and wasn't overly doughy. The noodles weren't too dry and they were super easy to slurp and weren't too heavy. The shrimp and loofah XLB was pretty good, however I'm not a huge fan of loofah in general so I definitely want to try their pork XLB next. The dry-fried chicken wings were probably my favorite. The outer batter was so beautifully fried and it had hints of curry (?). Food came out super fast and we left very full and happy :),I've been hearing a lot about Dumpling Home and it lived up to the hype!My friend and I came for an early dinner Thursday right after they opened at 5. They offer indoor and outdoor seating both, and since it was a nice day out, we went with the outdoor seating.We split three dishes:Juicy pork bao ($13.95 for 6) - this was so good! I see why everyone raves about the pork baos here. There's juice inside, but somehow they still make it so that the bottom of the bun is very crispy Pork xiao long bao ($8.95 for 4) - XLB were spot on as well with thin skin and lots of juicy goodness inside. One of my favorite spots for XLB in SF!Mushroom and chicken dumpling ($9.95 for 8) - pretty good, but I think all dumplings are generally pretty goodIt was a very affordable meal in SF! We only paid ~$22 pp after tax and tip and left very happy and with a full stomach.,I've been here many times over the years and can confidently say that this is my all-time favorite dumpling spot!! The juicy pork baos and XLB (xiao long bao) are legendary, but my absolute favorite is the crab XLB. Every soup dumpling is a must-try, but don't stop there. The cucumber salad, pig ears, chicken wings, and noodles are all noteworthy options on their menu. The only downside is the long wait time, even with indoor and outdoor seating. Parking can also be tricky depending on the day, but trust me - it's worth it for these delicious dumplings.,Dumpling Home is one of my favorite XLB spots in SF. Dumpling Home is located in Hayes Valley and this place gets BUSY!  They don't take reservations, but they do have an on-site Yelp waitlist. I usually come here for lunch because this place always has a line! I never had to wait because I would show up right when they open.Their menu has a variety of noodles, dumplings, pan-fried baos, and xiao long baos. All the XLB have a thin dumpling skin and the soup is packed with flavor! You can never go wrong with the Classic Pork XLB. My favorites are the Scallion Pancakes, Pan Fried Juicy Pork Baos, and Numb and Spicy Pork XLB.  The Scallion Pancakes are light and flakey which I appreciate! I don't feel like it's too greasy. The Numb and Spicy Pork is slightly spicy but not too spicy! I think it's unique and enjoyable. My least favorite item that I've tried is the crab and pork XLB. I think that it was alright but if you like crab then you should try it!Highly recommend! I would come here again if I'm craving XLB.,So many stellar reviews here.  I'm going to be honest.  While the dumplings were nice and juicy," this place is overpriced.  The noodles at $16 is for one serving only.  There were three of us and we had other items.  We had to order another """"bowl"""" of noodles.  The Dan Dan noodles were lukewarm.  I didn't care for that.The xiao long bao was good.  The pan fried buns were good too but small.  Service was quick.  We ended up paying close to $100 for the three of us for lunch.  Definitely will not come back.  I don't even think it's filling.",I've been wanting to try Dumpling Home for the longest time since I heard they opened up. I've driven by the restaurant a number of times and always seen a long waitlist so I finally went. The restaurant doesn't take reservations but they do have on site Yelp waitlist. There were 3 of us and we arrived right after 5pm, when they opened. There was already a line at the door but we were able to get in without any waitlist.- dan dan noodles- cucumber salad- crab and pork xiao long bao- pork xiao long bong- numb and spicy pork xiao long bao- pork baoSpecifically for xiao long bao, this may be my new favorite spot. You can tell by the pics that the skin was thin, yet intact, and the filling was generous. The soup inside was so rich and flavor and really was a comforting sensation. I also really appreciated that you could taste the crab in the crab and pork as I've had it from other places where the pork overpowers the crab. It was my first time having a numbing xiao long bao. It wasn't overly numbing, but there was a light kick that was actually super flavorful and enjoyable. The dan dan noodles and cucumber salad were also well made, however, in the future, I would probably order another round of baos instead. I also enjoyed the pork baos. They're maybe the second best I've had in SF but the best so far in the immediate downtown area. Highly recommend if you want quality baos and I'll be back too,I've always wondered why this place consistently has a line out the door, and now I understand why. The food came out extremely quickly, the service was wonderful, and the food was so good. The pan fried juicy baos are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The XLBs are amazingly rich. Their noodles are wonderfully chewy and flavorful. We had to wait about an hour, but it was absolutely worth it. It's better to go on the earlier side- we were the last party to be placed on the waitlist before they closed it off for additional people; it was around 7pm on a Saturday night. I'd 100% go back to try more of their dumplings.,Being an avid lover and voracious consumer of all XLB and SJB that I can find (was born in Shanghai, moved to US when young but traveled back to Shanghai frequently when it was still possible pre COVID), this place is quite good. We came here as our second brunch of the day (after quite disappointing dimsum at Yank Sing), and it definitely improved my food day. First, it was a rainy cold Saturday in December. We arrived at 11:33 on the dot and there was a line out the door. Sadly, this line meant we were the last party to NOT get a seat indoors. So come before opening if you want to eat indoors. But, we did get quickly seated at the first table outside next to the heater. It was still cold/not ideal but better than waiting 45 mins to sit inside. Soon, all the seats around us outside were filled. Throughout the hour we spent there, there was a consistent line down the block- so suffice to say, come at opening if you don't want to wait an hour or more, regardless of weather- at least on saturdays. Service was very fast and efficient. We ordered the following:1. Original Pork XLB2. Numbing Spicy XLB3. Crab & pork XLB4. Pan fried soup dumplings aka ShengjianBao aka SJB (think they call them juicy pork baos)5. Large Wonton soup 6. Chicken wings Thier XLB is truly top notch- the skins are perfectly thin, almost translucent with soup clearly visible but firm enough to not break while picking up, even after slightly cooled. Truly was perfect. Size wise they may have been maybe the tiniest bit too big versus ones in Shanghai but absolutely nothing to complain about. 10/10I do wish they gave us normal soup spoons to eat them with, the bowl/spoon contraption they have at the tables I guess are useful for people who don't know how to eat XLB, but are a hindrance to properly nibble and slurp. The SJB are perfectly sized, skins are nice and thin on top (Yangs style), and bottoms are crispy crunchy. There is also a decent amount of soup in them although there could have been more. My only gripe of these are that flavor wise they are a 'Wuxi style' ie: very sweet and soy flavored, versus traditional Shanghai style is pure pork flavor without soy. Not my favorite but most people won't be able to tell. 8/10 in my book given the flavor and the soup content Wings were good, but very saucy and sweet. Nothing to write home about. 7/10Wonton soup also good, nice textured skins, good filling but the soup was a bit bland. 8/10Overall, go for the XLB, the SJB I still would suggest everyone try because it's still one of the top 10 representations that I've tried in the US across many cities!,Might be my new go to dumpling place in the city!The food is delicious and just thinking about it makes my mouth water!The pan fried baos will have you dreaming about them for days! The ginger noodles were so flavorful! The brisket soup had such good broth! XLB was good!  The green beans and green onion pancakes are delicious too! Parking is a hit or miss in that area and it does get pretty busy there! Just know you prob have to wait a while for you table, but it's worth it! A litttle on the pricy side. My downside is that the tables are kind of small and everything comes out so quick and like almost all at once that the food gets cold quick,After 3 attempts of trying to eat here, I finally had a chance to make it happen when an older colleague was visiting the Bay! First off, they've got Yelp Waitlist, so if you are near the area, hop on the app and save yourself some time because this place gets packed for lunch and dinner. We came right when the opened and were able to get seated right away.For food, we got the pork XLB, numbing pork XLB, juicy beef bao, and some green beans. The traditional pork XLB is definitely delicious, while the numbing one, honestly didn't taste that much different, the numbing spice was minimal. I like that you can order in 4s bc it allowed us to try more. But honestly, we regretted not going for 8/4 because these are so damn easy to eat. What was weird was that the soup inside wasn't piping hot, more luke warm, but tasty nonetheless. Also shout out to them not putting it in a foil tin. In my experience if they put an XLB in a foil tin, it'll be mid at best.We ordered so much pork we decided to go with the juicy beef bao, hindsight, probably shouldn't stuck with pork but damn this was the star of the show. The soup inside was super hot, and honestly if I don't get burned eating it, did I even eat it soup dumplings? It's part of the experience lol. Definitely would order more of these, it's unique and can't get it at most places. As for the green beans, nothing spectacular but I'd order it again. The lag time between the regular dumplings and the juicy ones was easily 30-40 minutes. Which was kinda frustrating bc we were getting hangry and anxious wishing we had ordered more XLBs lol. It was worth the wait though. It was evident they were short staffed, so waving them down when they are near by helps. This is a perfect place to come with 3-4 people. For the fact it's on the pricier side, so have a couple extra ppl will allow for trying more menu items, without breaking the bank. Definitely a solid dumpling spot that has moved up over my old fav dumpling place in my power rankings. Will be back to try mores.,I've been wanting to try this place for a while but never had an excuse to go down to Hayes Valley. Normally I try to avoid that area because the parking isn't the greatest, but I made an exception to go here! I planned to get there exactly at 11:30 am and while I was power walking my way down the block, I already saw a line out the door! Luckily, once the doors opened, the line moved quickly and we got seated outdoors. What we ordered:-Beef brisket noodle soup-Pan fried juicy pork buns-Numbing XLB-Pork and chives dumplings -Dried fried green beansEverything was perfection!! The XLB/dumpling scene is so vast in the Bay Area, so I wasn't expecting to be wowed, but I sure was. All the dumplings were so consistent in presentation and flavor. My favorite had to be the pan fried juicy pork buns. The skin was thin, just the way I like it. The numbing XLB isn't actually too spicy, mostly just rich in flavor. I'll definitely go back! I want to try more of their small appetizer plates next time.,This place is located in the Hayes Valley and is within walking distance of the SF Symphony and Opera House along with the Civic Auditorium.  This place has high traffic and finding parking here will be a challenge.  On a Saturday at 5pm when it opens, we found a metered parking (on $1.25/hour) within a block of here just prior to opening at 4:45pm.Prior to 5pm on Saturday (9/24/22), There were easily 15-20 parties waiting to get in and they would all be seated without issue.  The staff here are organized.  Indoor or outdoor seating is available.  We chose indoor.  The seating was relatively comfortable.  Service is fairly quick.  Even being seated simultaneously with at least 15 parties, we would have service in 5 minutes and something to eat in 15 minutes.Everything here is pretty decent.  Some items are better than others:For appetizers, we had:the beef tongue (4.5/5); pretty good with the numbing sauce and tender though not a whole lot of flavor.The pigs ears with cucumbers (4/5); pretty good though I have had better.  Best pigs ears in the Bay Area are at this place in Downtown Oakland (Huangcheng Noodle house).XLB-5/5 pretty close to as good as I've ever had.  The broth was hot and flavorful (soupy gingery taste was amazing)Fried Pork Bao- 4/5: pretty unique but a little too filling;Dan Dan Noodle: 4/5: good but not spicy enough but tastes good if you add soy sauce and hot sauce to it.We also tried the special, the scallop/winter melon XLB (3.5/5): was different but not all that special.  It was good but if I had to do it over, I would not have ordered as I was probably too full.Did not feel disappointed given the hype this place has and the atmosphere is homey and social.Service is reliable and friendly and the cost for SF was reasonable.  I would definitely come here again if I have the XLB craving.,Delicious sampling of dumplings. I don't think they take reservations in advance but you can stop by and test your luck! They have a break from lunch to start of dinner where they are closed so beware. The food comes out quick! The fried base of the dumplings were great surprisingly and sadly didn't care for the Xiao long baos they were bland. Scallion pancakes had the right flavor but were very dry. I guess it s good it wasn't oily? This is a Michelin Bib gourmand restaurant, but perhaps needs to re evaluate some of their menu items.,I had the shiitake mushroom chicken dumplings and the Shrimp loofah.Both were delicious.. very filling. Service was very nice. Place is very casual and clean.,5 stars for the fast service and the food at this place. They always have a crazy line but now I get it. The food is good and there's not too many dumpling places in Hayes Valley. No reservations so you have to go there in person for the waitlist . It was more than an hour until we got called since we were 22nd in line. We were there on a rainy day and still there were just lots of people waiting in the rain for their seats.,Came here with my friends after happy hour for a quick bite. My friends who came before had ordered so I'm not sure what everything is called but the dumplings that are pan fried on the bottom are TO DIE FOR!!! Super juicy and meaty which I loved. It was steaming when I bite into it. Also... that little red spoon is for eating your dumplings not for dipping sauce... I made that mistake. I did prefer the pan fried dumplings over the xiao long bao, but enjoyed the variety!,First time trying this place while in SF this last weekend. Expect a wait. There is usually a line but they estimated 30 mins for us, which wasn't too bad, but it was actually 45-50 mins realistically. The Xiao Long Bao's were good! I recommend the crab and pork ones. The XLB wrapping was perfect, not too thick and the size was perfect to get a good soupy base with meat. The red dumpling spoons were cute and convenient. We also ordered the green onion pancake and pork baos which were good, but nothing amazing. The wonton soup was a lot (about 8 wontons), great for sharing, but tasted mediocre. The jellyfish was crunchy but not marinated, so very plain. We ordered every other XLB like the shrimp and mushroom ones and they were all ok. We ordered the boiled dumplings for the kids, but they tasted just ok. I just like the crab & pork XLB and pork XLB the best. Service was a bit slow. They didn't bring out any soy sauce or chili sauce until we asked. Needed more water, etc. When we got the bill, I was a little surprised at how expensive it was. This place isn't cheap and it adds up quickly!,The food was good but it definitely wasn't omg this is the best dim sum I've ever had in the Bay Area type of good! It was also SO expensive. $20 for 8 piece XLB? That's kinda ridiculous in my opinion. The XLB were very standard, they tasted like XLB I could get at any of the other great dumpling spots in the Bay Area! This would've been a solid three star spot for me but I do have to admit that the pan fried pork buns were delicious. They saved the day! I definitely recommend ordering those over the XLB. The tops were thin and soft while the bottoms were thick and crispy. There was so much soup in them too! I don't recommend ordering the seasoned beef pockets. The portion was ridiculously small and there was so much hoisin sauce in them. I personally won't be back for a sit down meal but I do see myself ordering their own fried pork buns to go! Everything else was standard and overpriced. Plus parking is super difficult in this area.,On a Friday night this place was poppinggg with a large crowd gathered outside waiting to be seated. I came here to meet with friends I haven't seen in a long time and based on a recommendation from a friend we chose to eat at Dumpling Home!While the crowd was a little intimidating, I queued via the Yelp Waitlist on their iPad (which is not available on the app but it instead acts as their in-person placeholder). We were a party of 4 with around 10 parties ahead of us. Within 15 minutes, however, we were at the top of the list and seated!Based on the recommendations from a lot of reviews, we got the Juicy Beef Pan Fried Dumplings, Numb & Spicy Pork Xiao Long Baos, Pork Xiao Long Baos, Green Onion Pancake, Dan Dan Noodles, and Braised Beef Noodle Soup.The star of the show has to be the Numb & Spicy Pork Xiao Long Baos! We were a little nervous about the spice level," but surprisingly they were quite mild and I wasn't mad about it. The spicy aspect of the dish comes from the soup part itself so consider yourself warned when trying to inhale that soup yall lmao.What I was also pleasantly surprised with was the size of the xiao long baos. I feel that in the Bay Area a lot of """"soup dumplings"""" or xiao long baos tend to be on the smaller size than what I am used to at least on the East Coast. Dumpling Home", however, serves generous portions of soup and meat per dumpling.As for the rest of the dishes, I wasn't overly impressed with them. I was expecting the Juicy Beef Pan Fried Dumplings to blow me out of the water per reviews (which is why it can be both a curse and blessing to read reviews before coming to a restaurant like you're reading this one now), but the result was that I was splashed in the face because I blindly bit into the dumpling not knowing just how juicy it really was  pro tip: open these juicy juicy dumplings before you just bite into them, you'll thank me later.At the end of the day, I enjoyed my time at Dumpling Home! The food is delicious and there wasn't anything I didn't like (sorry for the double negative). Solid spot As always, happy eating yall!,This dumpling place exceeded my expectations! We got 3 kinds of dumplings, two soup ones and a fried one. The reason why I did 4 stars is because the fried one was good however being fried the texture seemed too chewy for me. But it was still delicious! The numbing soup dumpling was my absolute favorite, it was so full of flavor and at the right amount of spice. Same as the other dumpling, I didn't even need to use any sauce because it was so good. The green beans was so yummy! I love a simple vegetable stir fry and this hit the spot.,Perfection! The pork filling was juicy and tender. The skin just thick enough to hold everything in. The flavors all on point. The crispy was beautifully crunchy and the soft melt in your mouth. The service was spectacular. Friendly staff, good cans out quick and hot, and there was no wait for us (a party of 2) at 5:15. Plenty of elbow room, works for a pre-show meal or just a family dinner. I highly recommend this spot as a local favorite as well as a destination if you're in town for an event.,"Xiao Long Bao... is more like Xiao Long WOW! I discovered this restaurant after watching YouTube videos from Feed MeiMei's YouTube channel. I highly recommend trying the """"Numb & Spicy Pork Xiao Long Bao"""". The XLB was so plump and flavorful. The skin was thin. It was THE perfect bite!","Worth the wait!  Great friendly service and delicious dumplings!  Dumplings served hot and very juicy! So juicy they give you a little cup to eat it from!  Just the right amount of spice for me and a few side sauces which may have been a little soy and vinegar --- sesame oil --- chili---Would definitely come here again!  There are a few shops in the neighborhood to walk through while waiting for them to call you when your table is ready too.  We are so fast that all I got were """"after"""" pictures:)",From a Shanghai Local: The Best Soup Dumplings in the U.S. I've ever hadThe soup dumplings have the best proportion of soup in there. The Crab and PorkXiao Long Baos aremy favorite and then the Numb and Spicy ones. They are soooo flavorful! We also tried the original pork ones, they're also very authentic. You can skip the shrimp ones, they are way less juicy. I've never had any good shrimp xiao long bao in China either as it's traditionally not a thing. The skins are relatively thin and chewy. (Ding Tai Fung still has better skins but not better in anything else) The scallion (green onion) pancake is great too as well as the pan fried Bao. They are also juicier with thinner skins than most places as how they should be. The Ginger and Green Onion is not as good as the ones I had in Shanghai. They could put in more chives.,Too good. This place was recommended to me from a friend from China, and it did not disappoint! I did takeout, but would highly recommend lining up at 5p and eating there so your food doesn't get cold. It was wild to watch how quickly the restaurant filled up with a waitlist on Friday evening. My favorites were the pan fried pork dumplings and the crushed cucumbers, but beware! The pan fried dumplings were so juicy when I bit into them, juice (aka liquid gold) squirted out all the way across my table! Thank goodness I didn't have any guests across the table!The XLB were delicious too, they were just a bit cold by the time I got home, but again, that's my fault.,This place deserves all the stars. Be prepared for a 45 min wait. We showed up at 7:30pm on Friday night and were seated at 8:15pm.  They use the Yelp Waitlist tablet, but it doesn't seem like there's a way to add yourself to the waitlist online. Seems like you have to do it in person. Everything we ordered was super tasty. Boyfriend's favorite was the Shen Jian Bao (he maintains we should have ordered 2x as many). Xiao Long Bao were super authentic, my Shanghainese mom would approve. Thin yet sturdy skin and plenty of soup filling. Crispy chicken wings were indeed super crispy. It's very much battered, deep fried, and then coated in a sweet sauce. Hot and sour soup and green beans were excellent versions of what they are, though I felt the portion could have been more generous of the beans. I enjoyed the onion noodles very much, but boyfriend didn't like the flavor. Definitely somewhere I would like to bring my parents when they visit!,Great food!  Be sure to get on the waitlist. Order several kinds of dumplings. Nnnnnnn,This place was that good I had to door dash it the following night. For anyone who wants to or is getting aquatinted with dumplings for the first time, this is the perfect place to do so. I brought several friends to this place to do family style after seeing it on an Instagram reel. And boy the food did not disappoint. We ordered different dishes and each one was uniquely crafted and tasted totally different from the one before. My personal favorite was the crab and pork xlb and the pork baos. Both were juicy with flavor and reminded me of a home cooked meal. The only downside to this place is the long wait, but it is totally worth it in the end. The place wouldn't have a long wait if the food wasn't good! So add this to your list when your looking for something alongside cozy and delicious.,The name might be simple but it's perfect. These dumplings and baos are made to perfection in this building and they are proud to call it home.We found this place while visiting SF and we went here TWICE in a week. We also ordered the Green Beans, Brussel Sprouts, Beef Tongue, Panfried Dumplings, Crab/Pork XLB, & Spicy/Numb XLB. All of which we would order ALL OF THEM again.If you want to see all the footage, we have a video on IG/TT at @phidingthefam,LOVE THIS PLACE!Overall thoughts: They always have a swarm of people and there's a reason. It's cause they're so good! I've been here a few times and every time, I've been blown away by their handmade dumplings and delicious food. This place is great to impress your out of town friends! Experience: The best time to go is when they first open. I've only gone around 6pm and 11am. I have never had to wait for a table event time I've gone. The line does get very long during peak lunch/dinner times. Service is good. They are always fast and they're easy to flag down for any help or extras. Food: Food is always amazing. The juicy pork bao is so good. The bottom is so crisp and it's so juicy too. It literally squirted across the room when I took my first bite. That's how juicy it is. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Trust me! Everything comes out as they're done cooking so the food is always hot and fresh.,Dare I say best dumplings..ever?! Wait time was less than 10 minutes on a Wednesday night and there's a good amount of street parking around the area.Everything I had was so good and perfectly seasoned. One thing was that our noodles didn't come hot, but the flavor and textures made up for it. I loved everything I had, but my top favorite was the Juicy Pork Bao. I was so full already and it came at the end of my meal, but still so so delicious. Maybe next time I'll request to get those first. These dumplings are on the pricier side, but well worth it. If you're craving a good dumpling place, I highly recommend!,This lived up to the hype! One of the best XLB on the west coast of U S of A. You know its good when you pick it up and it sags without breaking. And theres so much juicy broth inside each one. Favorites: - Numb and spicy pork XLB - Pan fried juicy pork - Crab and pork XLB The green onion pancake and Ginger noodles were good but not omg you have to order them if you're here kinda thing. Definitely stick to the dumplings. We also were seated right away which was lucky, thank you dumpling gods!,One of the BEST shengjian baos (their juicy pork baos) I've ever had!! Crispy bottom with such a juicy filling. Caution: the juice in the dumpling will likely squirt out. Be careful! We also got the spicy and numbing pork XLBs and seasoned beef pockets. The XLBs were good, great wrapper texture, filling was lacking. The beef pockets were decent but overall forgettable. We got there around dinner time and there was a bit of a wait but service was prompt from start to end. Prices are a bit steep compared to other places in SF but I will look past it for how good their juicy pork dumplings are,Been here many many times, tried a large variety of things on their menu. All are solid and taste authentic. Portions are on the smaller side so good for sharing - 4-5 dishes are good between two people. They have both indoor and heated outdoor seating. It gets busy even right before they open, there is already a line around the corner. The wood ear/fungus appetizer is very good.,Pretty on par with great XLB/shengjianbao I've had in LA/626 or more traditional dimsum restaurants BUT you're definitely paying for it (for SF/Hayes Valley, and the modern ambience). The numb and spicy XLB were an interesting variation and while I'm glad I tried them, I would not order again -- the numb and spicy flavor profile is by definition extremely bold yet somehow it became super muted in Dumpling Home's XLB rendition. The shengjianbao were adorable, but dangerous (of course I knew to watch out for projectile shooting of the hot soup but I swear it still almost got me in the eye). I expected the dry-fried chicken wings to be similar to San Tung wings but they were actually much more juicy/meaty. The flavor/crispiness of the breading was more similar to honey Korean fried chicken.Overall, I'm glad to have a quality dumpling/Chinese restaurant outside of Richmond/Sunset!,Love this place! The wait wasn't too bad at 6ish but the waitlist process makes it super simple and keep expectations real. The food comes out as fast as they can but not immediate so I know they're fresh! The amount can be overwhelming so it's hard to try multiple dishes between a couple of people- so bring friends! Or to go boxes :). Reco dishes as a must:Crab pork xlbPan fried dumplingAlso recommended: beer and Dan Dan but can forego or get it to go instead.,This place is hands down the best place for soup dumplings in SF. It's worth the long lines, although I'd get here right before opening to snatch a table. It's first come, first serve. I've been here a few times, both takeout and dine in, and the quality is always consistent. I would highly recommend the cucumber salad, green beans, pork soup dumplings, and pan fried pork dumplings. The pan fried pork dumplings remind me of the ones I had in Shanghai, they're that good!! I'd probably pass on the red chili oil wontons, they aren't the usual authentic kind and is tossed in a ton of sesame sauce. Such a stellar spot in Hayes Valley, and a must try if you're in SF!,With a lot of my friends's recommendation, I went here with a high expectation and it was good overall. We got there around 7pm, which is the busiest time but we got seated around 7:40pm which was pretty good as a very popular place. Since we were party of two, we were not able to order a lot of dishes but had big ears, jelly fish salad, Xiao Jian Bao, and the seasonal special scallop and winter melon xiao long bao. Jelly fish salad was my favorite but I was really surprised how the soup for the xiao long bao was - even though it didn't have any meat," the use of wintermelon was working really well and absorbed right amount of soup and very filling and satisfying. The service was a little bit rough but also they let us stay until we are done talking after the closing hour which was nice. Would love to try other dishes with a larger group next time.""""",The best dumplings I've tried in a while. Hands down. The service is fast and taste is delicious. I think the juicy pork baos are overrated... definitely other things in the menu that are better.,First timers coming here! We had heard from a friend that this place had bomb XLB and we had try it out. We came on a weds around lunch time and there surprisingly was a good amount of people eating. It's also located in Hayes valley where people are always out in about. We were sat immediately when we arrived and we ordered the pork XLB, the juicy pork bao and the spicy wontons with peanut sauce. The juicy pork bao came out rather quickly and was steaming hot. It came with its own dipping sauce and Omg they were so tasty (mouth currently watering). I would say they were a 5/5. V flavorful on the outside and juicy on the inside. I would say that the spicy wontons were more of a 3/5 just because I feel like the filling could use more flavor, but the pork XLB were one of the best I've tried. Those XLB were oozing with flavor from the soup and the filling. 5/5We are definitely coming back to order more of what we liked and of course a bunch of other items we didn't get to try.,I AM SO EXCITED TO REVIEW THIS RESTAURANT! I've travelled all over eating food, hitting a lot of classic spots, stuff featured on Food Network, too yelp reviews spots...I've been blessed to have eaten a ton of good food! But this place....this place may easily be one of the best meals I've ever eaten. This is the most unsuspecting Michelin restaurants I've ever been to, the price is crazy affordable, and the food is DROOL WORTHY. The Juicy Pork Bao is one of the greatest dishes I've ever eaten. It hits every element. To die for. The Long Bao (soup dumplings) made me want to shout). The Fried Chicken Wings were a pleasant surprise, they were crispy when we got them and never got soggy. The spice level was PERFECT. When I am old and gray I will tell my kids about this place. The meal I had will live in my dreams and memories for the rest of my life. If I ever know of anyone traveling to SF I will FORCE THEM TO GO HERE. It literally can't get better than this!,Queue out the front door but waitlist went quick. Ordered 4 dishes. Our favorites were the Pork Dumplings with Sesame Sauce and Red Chili Oil and the Hot and Sour soup - absolutely delicious!,Service seems more pleasant and helpful on our most recent visit. Food is still really delicious. I finally got to try the Numb and Spicy pork xlb. Yay! When I went with my other friends, they always like to order the classic xlb (not spicy) so I am always super curious about the numb and spicy. Honestly, I prefer the classic ones, too. Now that I tried the spicy ones that is. The spicy ones are neither numbing nor spicy enough for my tastebuds and just isn't as exciting as the good ole classic.,I've been eyeing Dumping Home since it opened and telling everyone that reviews claim it's the best XLB in the city. Well, I finally tried it the other day, and now I can say it's actually my favorite XLB spot in SF! The filling is some of the juiciest I've had, and the dough skin is nicely thin. I tried both the traditional pork and numb & spicy pork filling, and I liked the spicy one even more. The sheng jian bao (juicy pork bao) were also excellent, with similarly generous soup filling. The thicker dough was the right ratio and had a nice texture contrast of fried and chewy. Save space for the other menu items. I especially loved the rich sesame sauce on the dan dan noodles. If you like jellyfish, their simple version here hits the spot.I usually see lines, so I came early at 5:30 pm Thursday and there was no wait for two.,This place always has a line and I now understand why!!Food here is delicious! I had a blast and will definitely be back!We ordered:Numb and spicy pork XLB: 12/10My absolute favorite thing we ordered! I am a bit of XLB snob and i must say these were some of the best I've ever had. So soupy and not as spicy as the title makes it seem. Spice is very mild and nothing to worry about!Pork XLB: 6/10Compared to the numb and spicy, this was pretty average.Juicy pork bao: 8/10So good! Didn't expect it to be soupy because it's fried but I truly loved it! Dry cooked green bean: 10/10I loved the green beans! So so so good. Not sure how they've perfected the crunchy, cooked consistency but I'm obsessed.Dry fried chicken wings (spicy): 7/10I enjoy using chopsticks to keep my hands clean but it was really hard with the wings for me. They were delicious but easily overshadowed by the bao buns and the XLB.Wonton soup: 9/10SO GOOD!! Definitely recommend Ginger and Green Onion Noodle (Dry): 6/10We ordered way too much food so this was a bit much for our table of 4. Didn't end up getting finished.,Excellent, mouth watering dumplings. Very cute spoons made for eating soup dumplings.Juicy Bao - 5/5. Crispy outside, delicious soupy interior. Perfect.Xiao Long Bao - 4.5/5. Soupy and tasty.Shiitake Mushroom Chicken Dumplings - 4/5. Good but less memorableRed Bean Paste Pockets - 4.5/5. Perfect way to cap the meal with something sweet.Green Onion Pancake - 3.5/5. Fine but not particularly special.,Such good dumplings - no wonder it's called dumpling home! I tried the chicken bao, pork xlb, and onion noodles. The bao was the best! It was crispy on the bottom but the meat was so juicy and warm! The flavor of the meat in the bao and xlb was so savory and delicious. There was so much soup in the XLB, which is my favorite! A lot of other restaurants won't put much soup. The noodles were good, but I definitely think the dumplings were the star. I went on a Monday evening for dinner and the wait was ~30 minutes, so definitely expect a wait if you go during a peak time.,If you're looking for some delicious XLB I highly recommend coming here! The pork & beef XLB were my favorite! The pieces are a bit bigger than normal XLB's but they are very juicy and flavorful. Other than coming here for the XLB," I also came here for the string beans which were perfectly stir fried. It is coated in their special """"brown sauce"""" and is mildly sweet. I like the location of this place as well because it is walking distance to Naya Dessert and Urban Ritual. Parking is kind of hard to find because it is mainly street parking but if you come during non-busy hours on Mon-Thurs I'm sure you'd be able to find parking.",Stopped by a few weeks ago on a Wednesday and Dumpling Home was poppin, though we only had to wait for 15 minutes. The interior is cozy, casual, and quirkily decorated, and the service was fast! For two, we ordered:Fresh cucumber with garlic sauce: staple veggie/side dish! Super refreshing and hecka garlicky. Numb & spicy pork XLB: if you get one thing, please get this! These XLBs were jam-packed with flavor; I've never had a dumpling like this before. Highly recommend!Braised beef noodle soup: a bit bland for my taste, and too many noodles for the amount of soup that was given, which made the noodles a bit lacking in flavor. Overall, I'd definitely come back for fast yet unique Chinese food. Great place in Hayes!,We've heard so much about this spot it was basically a mandatory!! We had friends in from town and saw an opportunity to really dig into the entire menu. We started with some garlic and green onion noodles that honestly slayed for a dumpling house! I feel like people forget to try all the other wonderful items on the menu. Along with the green onion pancake our visit was off to a great start. The veggie dumplings are so fun and beautiful in green and were filled with traditional Chinese egg roll filling. But the real winner were the xiao long baos. We got multiple flavors (except the shrimp apparently those sell out asap ! So sad) and honestly across the table every item was perfect. You. Cannot. Go. Wrong. See you at dumpling home!,The best 小笼包 I've had easily. Skin didn't break and the fried bao was so good. Mini 小笼包 spoon is quite cute too. Felt very hole in the wall,Every now and then I get the itch for delicious, juicy soup dumplings and Dumpling Home scratches that itch and then some. The location is beautiful and safe, and eating outside is as much of a pleasure as the interior within. My friend and I ordered way too many dumplings to keep track of, but the standard pork XLBs were awesome! They were juicy, savory, hot, and best of all, delicious! It's easily among the best XLBs I've ever had and while I won't say it's THE best, it's in the conversation. We also tried to chicken XLBs as an experiment and found them surprisingly good! Despite the chicken filling, the dumplings were just as savory and delicious, just with a slightly different flavor twist. The pan fried dumplings were also great, with a crisp exterior and a delicious interior. Would definitely recommend getting them alongside the XLBs for a bit of variety!Dumpling Home is definitely home to some of the best dumplings in SF and I would easily recommend it to anyone! Really the only complaint I would have is that it's very pricy for dumpling standards, but definitely delicious!,4.5 stars If you're looking for a casual dinner with friends in Hayes Valley, are not in a time crunch and don't mind being seated on a sidewalk table with people walking by - this is a great choice! We came here on a Friday evening. They have a yelp waitlist you need to add yourself to when you arrive. Our wait time was around 20 mins for a table of 2 outside We ordered Dan Dan Noodles, Juicy chicken Pan fried Bao and Pork Xiao Long Bao. The noodles were served first - creamy with a burst of flavor at the bottom, be sure to thoroughly mix them for even distribution. Omg the chicken pan friend bao was the highlight for me - so crisp with a tender meatball filling! Soup dumplings were piping hot with a lovely savory broth.Must try the Xia Long Baos and Pan fried ones. If they had an online waitlist I would definitely come here more often.,AMAZING LITERALLY LIKE THE BEST XIAO LONG BAO AND PAN FRIED DUMPLINGS I'VE HAD IN THE US!!! I would go here again 100 times. I can't wait to bring my friends to try this place!Only downside is that because it's so good and popular," the restaurant gets crowded and you will probably have to wait to get seated. But I think it's worth the wait!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Arang,"Heard about this place from a friend and ordered take out via Uber eats. The owners are so kind, I was having issues with adding more items from the app and so I called and they were so understanding and made it super easy to add items on through the phone. When I went to pick up they had everything ready and even threw in a few sides! I asked when they had opened and they said they had remodeled recently! Would definitely come here again to sit down and eat next time! This is a great local small business I would love to continue to support! The chicken was also soooo good! We ordered almost all the different types, the battered skin was still crunchy even after being coated in all the delicious sauces! My personal fav was the supreme yangnyum! Their most unique and equally as delicious was the nacho cheese chicken! Definitely something new but so good!Please support this small business,I miss the old Arang! Decided to give this new place a try. I ordered the spicy chicken soup and sweet & spicy chicken wings. The soup had a good kick. It came with some vegetables and dark chicken meat, which was very dry. It was VERY salty. The wings were okay. It came with fries. Careful, it was really hot! I almost burned my tongue. This was also really salty. Overall, this place was alright. Nothing really stood out to me. I was hoping it would be like the old Arang.,Didn't know what to order but the young lady server helped me deciding! Had a hard time looking for the place because the entrance is pretty small.,I really like this small homey hole in the wall. Owner mentioned they renovated and reopened during the pandemic. The fried chicken was really good and the chicken soup was very homey and comforting. I highly recommend checking this place out and supporting this hole in the wall mom & pop Korean resto!,My partner and I stopped by Arang for a quick bite before a show at the Fillmore. We made a reservation through Yelp which wasn't needed when we went -- we were one of two parties in there. There seemed to be plenty of space between booths and tables. We decided to share an order of beef mandoo and half and half chicken wings, yangnyeom and ganjang. The dumplings were scalding hot but good! The chicken was super crispy and well-flavored. I preferred the ganjang, but that's probably because I'm not a fan of mixing sweet with savory. The chicken came with small piles of corn coleslaw, pickled radish, and fries. Overall, the food was good and it was a very reasonably priced meal for two people. If we had each ordered a plate of wings, we'd be stuffed -- as it was, we were comfortable but definitely not full. I wish there were a few more appetizer options, but as a whole, Arang is a great quick casual option.,Cute little Korean Fried Chicken Spot in SF!The fried chicken plates were very filling for the price ranging at about ~$18 and it comes with fries, corn coleslaw, and pickled radish (yummy!) Ordered the Ganjang (Soy Sauce) & Yangnyeom (Sweet & Spicy) Chicken - I personally liked the Ganjang sauce but the Yangnyeom sauce was also good sort of similar to a bibimyun sauce and not too spicy. Chicken's crunchy but also had that savory chewiness to it! You can also ask for half & half to try other flavors, plus bone-in or bone-less (for $1) Overall, recommend checking out this spot if you're in the area and need your korean fried chicken fix!,This place is nice and clean. Only ten tables inside. Staff is friendly. We ordered two items today. Korean Chicken Soup and Half and half Teriyaki sauce and Sweet and Spicy sauce Korean Fried Chicken. Be honest, the food here is just average. We didn't taste any chicken flavor in the soup, we can only taste the saltiness and black pepper. For the Teriyaki KFC, the sauce so thick, way too much sauce and very salty. For the Sweet and Spicy KFC the sauce also so thick and too much ketchup flavor. And the KFC is so small and they put too much flour to make it look bigger. Price and portions are not the best either.,This business popped on my radar in one of Yelp's weekly update about hot new businesses.  It also popped my curiosity since I recognized the address and had no idea about this business at this location.This area has been up and coming for a while before everything changed in 2020.  With Michelin restaurants getting acclaim and new popular businesses (boba and bagels, anyone?), there is no shortage of food options within this block.  While running an errand at this particular center, I walked by and was shocked to find this diamond in a rough.Knowing that I'd be in the area, I called in my order a little after noon and was quoted a pickup time twenty minutes later.  Having already eaten lunch before my errands, I ate the food over the next week.  The first item that I ate was the fried chicken, half half, Yangnyeom and Ganjang chicken with bones (yelp.com/user_local_phot…), which translates to sweet and spicy and soy sauce chicken respectively; the order comes with a delicious corn cole slaw and pickled radish. I highly recommend eating them there as the skin was a bit soft after reheating in my toaster oven.  I may try using a higher heat next time.  The cole slaw was different as I'd never had one with corn which adds a sweet element.  The purple radish were tangy and bold. I also bought a lunch combo with Supreme Yangnyeom chicken plate (yelp.com/user_local_phot…) home; the meal comes with purple rice, dumpling, potato (tater tots), corn cole slaw, and pickled radish.  Besides being a substantial amount of food, all items were tasty.  The meat was boneless which made this a lot easier to pair with the purple rice as I enjoyed that sweet and spicy sauce.  Again, with the number of fried foods, this is probably better eaten dine in or shortly after picking it up.There was only a single person eating in the left dining area.  A family of three walked in when I first arrived but, after getting something from my car, they weren't there.  Perhaps they placed a takeout order too.Big thanks for Yong, the young lady who put my order together besides giving me a cup of ice water as I waited near the entrance.  Likely because of my order size, she also generously gifted me a two-liter bottle of Coca Cola.  Looking forward to coming back when infection numbers decline more.,I went to Arang years back but they have completely revamped the place. Not sure if it's new ownership or if they just wanted something different, but the update is welcome. This place is now mostly KFC (Korean Fried Chicken)-type dishes. However, I was more interested in the section of the menu where everything was a soup and began with ""Dak"".Everything tempted me but I tried the Dak Gaejang - spicy chicken soup with vegetables. It was the first time I've seen this on a Korean menu and is basically Yuk Gaejang with Dak (chicken) instead of yuk (beef). Broth was nice and savory and they were generous with the chicken. Please note that their broth is also made with beef bone marrow, although I don't mind since this added an extra dimension of flavor.Also available: Assorted chicken soups with rice, rice cake, noodles, beef dumplings, and both beef dumplings & rice cake. Side dishes weren't a lot (sauced onions/jalapenos & salad), but maybe in line with KFC places. The purple rice that comes with everything is nice though, since it's actual purple rice.,Really enjoyed this place. My girlfriend and I grabbed a quick dinner before a show at the Fillmore. Good food, nice service, and affordable prices all in a nice, relaxed environment. Will be back.,Randomly wandered in on a Monday during lunch break.  I was the only one inside.  The place looked very clean and modern looking.  The teriyaki chicken was delicious for only $15.  I shall return soon.,Great Dak Kalguksu. The owners are mom and pop and are so nice. My go-to spot after a night of drinking or on a cold cold night.,Amazing  I'll absolutely recommend, thank you. Among customer service attendants and employees are very attentive and helpful and friendly staff friendly service staff and friendly service.,Yay! Finally my favorite Korean restaurant is reopened again. I tried their new soup yesterday, it was fantastic. Chicken soup with clear noodles and served with fresh kimchi. I loved it, definitely come back here again for this soup and will try their Korean style fried chicken next time.  Check out their new menu and don't miss out this chicken soup!!! Highly recommended.,Nice fried chicken, freshly made, nice chicken soup too! Everything is made from scratch which takes a little time.,It is obviously hidden-talented Korean restaurant in upper San Francisco. Even though it seems not to be known to public well, it sets a variety of typical Korean food in array and profoundly spicy food brings emotional attraction to Korean food lovers.,Really good restaurant! The fried chicken was crispy af. The kalguksu was dank. Awesome hole in the wall restaurant to enjoy chicken and drinks. Will be back,Me and my wife randomly saw this walking by and decided to go in. Really good Korean fried chicken.  The soups they have are pretty good too.,So glad Arang is open again! After a long closure they are open again with a new menu. Their soup and chicken are both delicious. Glad to have them back in the neighborhood!,Kind of tuck off the Main Street but it's clean, friendly staff, tasty food even though it needs to upgrade its menu to include Korean food. I would go to this establishment again. Thank you!,The lady working there is cheerful and friendly.  Now many customers after 8pm on Saturday.  The chicken soup is good and prices are reasonable in general.  I like the place because it's not too crowded and can have a good chat with friends.,I saw this place recently opened up in my way home from work and stopped by to get some takeout for dinner and I'm glad I did. The Korean fried chicken was not only crispy but also juicy. Along with the chicken I also got the chicken beef dumpling soup was the best Korean soup I've had since moving here. The meal also came with some really good sides and fresh kimchi. I recommend if your visiting Japantown or live close any and need to stop by to grab a bite to eat or to take some food home for dinner, to definitely stop by here.,Great place to grab a drink with a friend (soju + beer)!! Super affordable compared to the other Korean places in the area, with soju ~12/bottle and large selection of beer ~5-6/bottle. Only had their gun mandoo (dumplings) and alcohol this time because my friend and I had already had dinner beforehand but it was clean, music was not too loud, and service was really good. I would definitely go again to meet a friend or for some tasty chicken and alcohol. It looks like a mom and pop owned business, I really hope to frequent it often :,),i love the old arang they have so much menu and used to go and eat there everyday for lunch!! im sure their food is as good ad the old once but i just really hope the old menu comes back,food is 10/10, and workers/owners are 10/10. excellent food AND customer service. definitely recommend when you're visiting San Francisco and craving some classic Korean food!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fable,"We came here for dinner and ordered the clams, bonuelos, vegan lasagna, and double cheeseburger. Our favorite was the lasagna because it was nice and light while still being flavorful. I liked the vegetables in it, especially the mushrooms. It had a nice texture because of the panko sprinkled on top.The back patio was very cozy during dinner because of the string lights and very strong heat lamps. It reminded me of being in hawaii because it was outdoors and filled with plants.Would definitely come back!,The restaurant itself is beautiful and super pretty, and the service is great. The fondue was good, would've preferred thicker chips or a heavier fondue, it was pretty watery. The chicken was great in my opinion, cooked really well and loved the filling. I would order again. The jerk pork shank seemed more braised than anything, and we were not told ahead of time that they were out of brussel sprouts and pancetta, which is part of why the dish was ordered versus another. It was a hearty portion which was nice. The halibut was the least flavorful and not a favorite.,Came here for a friend's birthday! We made a reservation in advance for 5 and were seated promptly. The ambiance was very lovely, the outdoor patio is all-weather friendly and super warm. It's very very lush and has really nice ~ vibey ~ lighting, and we found that the noise level was perfect. The server we had was really nice and helpful, and helped us with lighting the candles/serving the birthday cake we'd brought for our friend! Note: if you do bring a cake and ask the restaurant to serve it, they will charge you a fee (for us it was like $15, I think for per person). Food wise - I had the roasted pork chop and it was good. It came with a very sweet sauce (apple-cinnamony) and with a lot of roasted root vegetables. The vegetables were nice, and the pork was cooked perfectly (med-rare) and really juicy. Overall, it wasn't anything mindblowingly delicious, but just cooked well. It is a pricey restaurant though - the pork chop was around $25. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place for special occasions!,Picked Fable for a birthday brunch with a group of 10 because it was one of the few brunch places in SF I could find that accepted reservations.The back patio is pretty cute, and though it was rainy we were completely covered and dry. The menu has a range of options for various tastes/preferences and everyone seemed to enjoy the food. We shared the banana bread and enjoyed it, and I was very full/satisfied after eating my fried chicken sandwich.Service was nice/friendly as well!,Came here with a friend for brunch on weekend. We made a reservation in advance and sat at the back patio (I really like the plants and freshness of this nice hidden area). Food wise, we ordered an omelette, latte, and there nachos dish with fried egg and avocado (very delicious, I finished all of it). One thing I didn't like about this place is it only has one restroom and there was a line.,Looked up popular brunch spots in the area and saw this one. Decided to give it a try and it did not disappoint. Patio seating was lovely. It does get hot, and awnings don't cover the whole space. Service was helpful. Had the fennel cured trout eggs benedict, eggplant caponata omelette with breakfast potatoes, fable's sweet baguette french toast, and mimosas. Favorites were the french toast (caramelized peaches which were not too sweet) and eggs benedict! Food wasn't mindblowing but everything was cooked well and flavored nicely.,Our group of three came here for Sunday brunch and were able to be seated outside in the parklet immediately. Note that the back patio is only available by reservation. For food, I had a steak benedict. I loved how the egg and steak were served on top of focaccia. It was tasty and not too heavy. The chocolate chip banana bread was a nice sweet treat as well. I got a iced coffee, which felt a bit watered down for my taste. The outside parklet was cute, and I loved the plant theme throughout the restaurant. Our server was friendly, and the food came out quickly.  I later realized that we were incorrectly charged extra for part of our order, so I left a voicemail with the restaurant. I didn't hear back after a few days, so I called again and was put in touch with the manager who quickly corrected the charge which I really appreciated!,We were out and about today and decided to pop by an old favorite, Fable, on Castro Street. Called ahead to see if there was space, the host was very gracious / friendly and held us a table on the patio. The outdoor patio has lush plants and greenery and covering from rain/weather + elevated heaters to keep you warm.  I did notice the flooring is in a little need of some TLC (a recoat) - but overall, a fun, relaxed, and friendly vibe. The server was excellent as he was managing tables across almost the entire patio by himself. Stopped by in a timely manner upon arrival to check-in on us and see if we had questions or drink needs. I always ask, ""what's your favorite thing in the menu right now"" as my go-to question at any restaurant to gauge what the service will be like for the rest of the meal. He passed with flying colors - gave a few perspectives ob different things so that it was welcoming - and showed he knew the menu well. Food was tasty (and filling) --- still full two hours later  I ordered the burger, comes in a half pound serving. I added bacon and a fried egg for an upcharge -- the thing was HUGE (see photo). I gave up trying to eat it by hand and used my fork and knife - super messy but good flavors. My husbear had a Niçoise salad, which was excellently prepared and he loved it. It has been many months since we had been at Fable, so we were happy to see it still doing well after the pandemic hurt so many businesses.,Ive been excited to come to Fable for some time since they take reservations and have a beautiful patio! I had made reservations for 2 on the weekend, and we were seated on the patio. The menu online had shown lattes and other coffees, but when we asked the server we were told they only had straight espresso. I had asked if they could pour it over ice and bring a side of almond milk but was told no. I found that to be very odd.I ordered the omelette, it was over cooked and covered in salsa (not mentioned on the menu). The potatoes were also covered in so much seasoning it was all I could taste on the plate. My friend had ordered the French toast, she said it was good but nothing special and the way it was served was hard to eat. If I was in the area, I would give Fable another try but unfortunately I was not impressed with my first visit.,Looove this spot. Perfect for outdoor dining with nice space heaters, and it's just beautiful and green and lush!! We came for friendsgiving, it was delicious and everybody was really welcoming and nice. I esp loved the cauliflower and the pork chop.,Absolutely beautiful outdoor dinner seating - the heating lamps, lights, and plants bring this outdoor seating to life! Came here for Friendsgiving with the besties. We felt like dining in the middle of an exotic jungle - super cute and it didn't feel cold one bit; we forgot we were dining outside in SF! Honestly, I was taking notes (on lighting, plants, and the brand of heating plants) for our backyard, lol!!! Love the foods - absolutely delicious! Service was very good - our server was attentive and sweet. My girlfriend made the reservations (placed her credit card down for prepayment). We immediately got seated and ordered quickly. Ordered the Braised lamb shank, pork chops, and the pork cheeks appetizers. The lamb shank was so tender and mouthwatering! Wish the pork chops were cooked more and the cut was thinner. Highly recommend the braised lamb shank and the pork cheeks as an appetizer - so good!! I would avoid the pork chop just because the cut was too thick and the apples were too dry. I also ordered a coffee and for dessert, I ordered the adffogato. I did not like the affogato - I would avoid this, but maybe because I live in Hawaii half the time, and have Kona Affogatos (ie Kona Coffee Purveyors - spoiled!), which are beyond amazing. We also got the sorbet and chocolate mouse (vegan), which were delicious. Highly recommend getting seated on the upper level corner where the plants and statue are along with a long wooden table (we were with a party of 8-10). Definitely coming back to try their brunch!,A good friend was celebrating her birthday today and we chose Fable because it's close to home and it's DOG FRIENDLY! We had not read any reviews, but I must say that we hit a home run with this restaurant!  One of the bonuses was the heated patio that made you feel like you're in Hawaii... the comfortable table seating, surrounded by beautiful greenery was so unexpected and so inviting!  Our wait person, Laure (sp?)  was 'personality plus'. She had great timing and her attention to service was outstanding.  We both chose the roast beef on homemade focaccio bread with au jus and a light vinegarette side salad.  Delicious beyond words!  We both highly recommend Fable and can't wait return with more friends and of course the furry family members!,Make reservations!While we awaited the opening, a few people strolled. by and mentioned that this is one of the best restaurants on the Castro.We sat on the beautiful outdoor garden patio next to a trickling fountain.  We ordered the peaches with housemade ricotta, NY steak, .and a cheeseburger. The starter of peaches and housemade ricotta was innovative and memorable.Our burger was brought with cheese (we had asked without), but while they corrected it, we devoured the steak, which was delicious. The Au gratin potatoes were especially good. The burger was fairly pedestrian.,The red quinoa bowl - served warm - is delicious and surprisingly filling. The ""not so skinny"" Paloma is deceiving. At first I couldn't taste the alcohol. But half an hour later it hit me hard!They have one of the prettiest patios in San Francisco. Brunch for 4, plus 2 drinks - $130 before tax and tip.,Service: My main reason for the low score is the service. My friend and I waited at our table for 20 min and no one came to us to take our order or give us water. I flagged someone down and they said our waiter will come by. The waiter did not though. We were rushed at the end as well. I was not aware of a hour and half time limit. It was no where on the website and we were not informed when we first arrived. Food: I got the fried egg sandwich. It was decent. The focaccia bread was delicious, but the dish was mostly bread than anything else. I wish I had more arugula. The eggs were cooked with coconut oil, which I did not expect. My friend got the chicken sandwich, which looked way better. The blood orange mimosa was good though. The blood orange flavor was delicious.,Love a good brunch and this spot was perfect for a sunday brunch with our group of 5. We had a reservation and I love that they do take reservations when many places don't!Food was good, not my most favorite though! Most notable options were the egg sandwich and the friend chicken sandwich. So yummy! Pro Tip: Def add an egg to the chicken sandwich!Coffee selection is limited to just hot or cold coffee - but drink selections looked amazing!! There's a 75min table limit depending on the line for brunch, so be aware if you plan to just hang for a while.Also HUGE plus is their patio is pet friendly!! Love this fact and love that the weather was sooo nice while we were there!,This place is such a cute dinner spot- lots of plants and gives me summer nights in a backyard tree house vibes.The menu changes up, so it's not a huge menu selection, but just know, that's what makes it good.I ordered the salmon, which is cookedMedium well and layered on a bed of summer corn, so it was a really filling option. It's a simple dish topped with a delicious and subtle horseradish creme fraiche. The meatballs are pork and beef and we collectively agreed it was delicious. This was just a special, not sure how often they'll have this. Also highly suggest the summer peaches with homemade ricotta. We asked for the prosciutto on the side for our vegetarian friend and they were super nice about it. The peaches were super sweet and the dish had a hint of honey flavor which pairs well with the ricotta.,A beautiful back patio with lots of plants, but feels like indoor-dining from a COVID perspective, because there's 4 walls and a roof, and not a lot of airflow. We had a few special requests, extra crispy fries, sub grilled chicken instead of fried chicken, all of which were accommodated. I would dine here again, but request to sit in the front instead of in the back patio.,Had a wonderful brunch here with my bf today. Make a reservation for good seating and to avoid long waits. We got to sit in the garden patio in the back. The back patio is filled with beautiful green plants. It's such a calming vibe! We ordered the Fried Chicken Sandwich $18 and Double Cheeseburger $18. The fried chicken is so tender and the burger is really juicy! The fries that came with the two entrees were also yummy! Not sure what brand of coffee beans they use, but it was tasty! Our server was very nice and attentive. Will be coming back!,Cozy lil dinner place that definitely passes the ~vibe check~. We ate here on Saturday night and had no problem with reservations. Definitely request to sit outside--their patio is a plant mom's dream.For two, we ordered the pork cheeks as our appetizer and the sautéed salmon as our entree. The pork cheeks, paired with fresh kale salad and crispy shallots, were wonderfully breaded and seasoned. Get this! The salmon was sooo tender, though I really did not like the sauce--horseradish is probably just not my thing. Would order more next time, as I was hungry like two hours later. Otherwise, I loved the fresh food and prompt service.,Nice seating area outside even on a rainy day. The back patio is especially nice for this area. Everything was covered and there were heat lamps. Shared the banana bread, fried egg sandwich with fries, and steak eggs Benedict with salad. Everything was good but portions, especially the steak, were small. The side salad was good, and the fries were also very good. The banana bread was only three smallish triangles, and had chocolate chips in it. The eggs Benedict was ok but I wouldn't get it again. I actually ate the steak pieces separate and it's good quality. Finally tried it after being in Castro for several years. Will be back and I would suggest it. I'd like to see a standard Benedict, and a basic eggs, toast, hash browns, and meat on the menu.,While on a short visit to the Bay Area, my partner and I met up with our SF-based friend for dinner at Fable. The weather was nice, so we got to enjoy sitting outside on a calm Monday evening. As far as drinks go, the IPA was standard, but their Prosecco was very good. It was the perfect balance of sweet and dry, with some subtle fruity notes. I ordered the vegan squash lasagna which was, I kid you not, INSANELY delicious. Like I almost licked the plate. Some may be turned off by how much pomodoro was on it, but I like my food to be drowning in sauces, so I didn't mind at all. All the flavors were perfect. I found the dish filling, but not too heavy. My partner got the salmon with white summer corn. She enjoyed the salmon itself. Cooked well, nice flavor. Unfortunately, she didn't like anything else on the plate. The corn wasn't all that impressive and didn't complement the flavors and texture of the fish. Our dinner companion ate and enjoyed the caprese with no complaints. One of the best parts of the dinner was the service. We only interacted with one person who served as the host, server, and bartender for the whole place as far as we could tell. Friendly service, high level of menu knowledge, customer satisfaction focused... Fable has at least one phenomenal human staffed. Thank you for making sure it was a great night in San Francisco.,Fable is a very cute spot in The Castro with an adorable back patio, mixed service, inventive and inclusive menu with some standout items, and then a few ""meh"" items. 5 stars for the back patio, so dreamy and cute. 3 1/2 stars for the service, and a solid 4 stars for the food. Would I go back, absolutely! Below is what we tried:Mission Fig & Ricotta Appetizer - 5 Stars. This seasonal item was absolutely delicious, well balanced, and tasty. Braised Pork Cheep Appetizer - 3 Stars. Dry, dry, dry!  Served with a frisée on top, this came recommended to us, and we barely ate much of it. I wouldn't recommend.The 1/2 lb. Hamburger - 4 stars for the Burger, 4 1/2 Stars for the fries. This burger is huge, served pub style with a large brioche bun, best enjoyed with a knife and fork. Definitely add the bacon, it is quite delicious here. Not the best burger I've ever had but very good. Bread Pudding Dessert - 5 stars. Absolute perfection! I personally don't like a soggy bread pudding, and this is the opposite of that. This had a crispness to the crust that was delicious in every way. Peach Cobbler w Ginger - 4 Stars. Quite good, and great flavors, but the interior could have been a bit more firm and less runny. This still worked and was quite good and a fun seasonal item. What didn't work for me was the stiff service. I'm from LA where most waiters are nice and friendly, realizing that it's a service industry. Our core waiter (I think the name was ""AJ"") was fine, but gave a vibe that they didn't really care that we were there. A female (perhaps a sommelier since she helped us pick our dessert wines) was the opposite; friendly, engaging, and charming. Even as we passed by ""AJ"" on the way out and smiled they mumbled ""thanks,"" in what seemed to be a very passive and unwelcoming tone.,Holy ****. I think I just had a religious culinary experience at Fable. Asked the waitress to choose our food and she delivered. Burger and fries excellent. Ahi tuna and cauliflower excellent. Last minute date night turned into an amazing time.,I made a reservation on Open Table for a Saturday morning birthday brunch with a few of my friends. The restaurant was so accommodating; when I called them directly to add two more people to the reservation, they made the space for us on their outdoor patio. The service was great. Our waiter took our orders promptly and updated us on when the food would be out. We loved the food, ordering almost every dish on the menu. I shared the Sweet Baguette French Toast and the Chilaquiles with a friend; both were delicious. The baguette was soft but still had a bit of a bite, and the chilaquiles were flavorful. Thank you Fable for hosting me and my friends!,A quick thank you shoutout to my Yelp friend, Joseph A. for letting me know to sit in the back patio and wishing us a great lunch when I checked in on the app a few weeks ago. So this is a pretty relaxing spot in the Castro. They sat us in the back patio area which was perfect because it was a beautiful day, sun was shining, birds were chirping. Haha, just kidding about the chirping birds. So my friend L and I shared a double cheeseburger (we added bacon cuz why not?!?) and a roasted red and golden beet salad. I don't really like quinoa, so I asked for it to be on the side because it's hard to pick that out in a salad once mixed. I really enjoyed the salad. The burger was good, but similar to other burgers I had and I skipped the buns.,The Chilaquiles Puebla was excellent The fried chicken sandwich was excellent The eggs Benedict was good except that the eggs were over cooked. The greens that came were excellent. I liked the peppery dressing. Next time I'll get the Chilaquiles,We got the Dungeness crab tower as well as the lamb chops to share between two people. Fable isn't too pricey, and you definitely get some decent portion sizes for what you pay! We also ordered their special appetizer for the day which was really good. The crab tower was great, as it came with lots of avocados, oranges, and crisps that made for a unique dish. The lamb chops were also delicious, as they were very tender and bursting with flavor. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant.,Service was very friendly, but veeeery slow. My friends and I waited probably 45-50 mins for our food to come out after ordering, and the restaurant wasn't very busy since it was a Wednesday night. The muscles were delish, but their burger was extremely mediocre. Would've preferred a burger from The Habit over this one to be honestly. My friend ordered the duck and wasn't impressed by it either. Overall ambiance was great, through. Their outdoor seating was beautiful and heaters kept it perfectly warm.,As many others have said --- the ambiance and back patio are with and in itself a warm, inviting & zen experience. What really warms my heart is that I was able to bring my 15 week old back lab puppy, tie him to the table and chill while my friends and I dined. The staff practically ushers our puppy inside; LOVE our dog friendly SF culture. That aside - food was good - nothing that my fellow foodies probably haven't tasted already before -- nonetheless --  food quality - the pork (best if medium rare ) and Salmon mains were fuego! Paired w a bottle of sparkling to share w friends was perfect. Wait staff 10/10 and thank you for enforcing masks when walking around.,After coming here, I have to say that Fable has one of the nicest outdoor dining spaces that I've been to in San Francisco so far. Filled with lots of plants and cool decorations, this is a great place to eat if you want great patio seating! We had booked a reservation for this place, so thankfully we didn't have to wait too long to be seated. The space is fairly large and there are a good number of tables, so it wasn't too hard to have social distancing from the others who were also dining there.For the food, we got the Dungeness crab tower as well as the lamb chops to share between two people. Fable isn't too pricey, and you definitely get some decent portion sizes for what you pay for! The crab tower was great, as it came with lots of avocados, oranges, and crisps that made for a unique dish. It was the first time I had all of these together, and I really enjoyed the plating that they made for it! The lamb chops were also delicious, as they were very tender and were bursting with flavor. I believe it also came with some gnocchi, which also was quite flavorful.I would highly recommend visiting Fable for their outdoor seating and also since they have great tasting food! It's definitely a place that I would like to visit again in the future.,Im surprised i have not reviewed this place. All i can say is PLANTS! PATIO! RESERVATIONS ! Bloody Mariàs!! Lol the rest is ok :),I had a very disappointing brunch. It's cold out so I asked to sit inside. It's cold inside as well. I ordered the Chilaquiles and a cup of tea. The egg dish arrived quickly but the chips and cheese were cold under the eggs. I guess that was room temperature in this ice box. The tea was so hot that I asked for ice. I'm not usually a complainer but staff inattention warranted calling out.,This place has been on my list for a while and I'm so glad I was finally about to check it out. Great vibes with a fantastic cozy/cute patio out back! They tend to be pretty busy for brunch on the weekends so reservations are highly  recommended however our party of 2 got lucky and we were able to be seated pretty quickly without one.We ordered the: - Chocolate Chip Banana Bread: okay, I'm a bit of a purist and don't like any additions to banana bread, but this was surprisingly delightful. Lovely texture, not too sweet.- Fried Egg Sandwich: I don't eat pork so I had the bacon removed, and it was still very tasty! The foccacia was delicious, the egg was perfectly fried, the blue cheese spread was just the rich, savory funk I needed - Fable Omelet w/ Breakfast Potatoes w/ a side of bacon: my husband ordered this and was thorough satisfied so that's a win in my book- Mimosa Carafe w/ OJ: yes, just get it. Worth every penny.We will definitely be back!,Beautiful outdoor space with a great ambiance. Probably one of the nicest outdoor spaces I've eaten at in SF. I came on a Saturday night for dinner. Our server was very friendly, constantly checked on us and had great recommendations for wine and food. The outdoor patio had a great heater set up so we stayed warm back there even on a cold January night. For food we started with the crusted braised pork cheeks with a vinaigrette salad. I thought the pork was perfect and it paired well with the vinaigrette. We also got the special potato leek truffle soup which was super creamy and tasty. For entrees we got the salmon, pork chop and chicken breast. Between the 3 I'd say the pork chop was the best and cooked perfectly. I get worried with pork chops cause many places tend to overcook them when I order them but they were on point here. It was juicy and had tons of flavor. The salmon was a little undercooked and under seasoned imo and probably the only minor complaint I would have. I personally didn't try the chicken but my partner thought it was pretty good. Overall I'd rate this 4/5 and I would totally return in the future.,Came here for brunch for a friends bday but wanted to try their burger. Not bad! We sat outside and had a great time enjoy the weather. Burger was big and their fries are done very well. Definitely will try to come back,This place is great! The food is really good and the back patio is spectacular.We ordered the crab cakes (it was a special that day), lamb shank, and Mac and cheese. All were so good. The lamb was super tender, and the Mac and cheese was some of the best I've ever had.The best part of our whole dining experience was the back patio. When we made our reservation online we did an Outdoor reservation, and we were nervous that meant the parklet. However, we got seated on their awesome back patio that is filled with beautiful greenery. We had a heater right next to our table and were never cold. We would definitely recommend this restaurant to friends and come back to visit again!,I was here for an event where the back patio was reserved. Great atmosphere with an intimate space that wasn't ""too intimate."" The hors d'oeuvres were solid, especially the chicken sandwich sliders. I ended up ordering the salmon as an entree with the cobbler for dessert. The food was fresh and hit the spot. We ordered the mac n cheese and shishito peppers for apps. Quite good, the mac n cheese in particular. Recommended for events around 15-20. Pleasant evening.,Ambiance is king Great spot for a date night or social event Food:1/2 lb double cheeseburger with fries- 4.25/5:Fries came with a great side sauce that was very addictive. Burger was high quality- buns were soft and burger was juicy.Ambiance 5/5:Amazing backyard garden patio with a nice home like romantic feel! Great seating all around the restaurant. Service was good as well and staff were friendly in recommending menu items.,I would honestly rate this 3.5, but Yelp is forcing me to round..Came for a friends birthday dinner, and let me tell you, their outdoor patio is gorgeous and the heat lamps are AMAZING! Was nice and cozy the whole time, and the low lighting was welcoming.Ambiance 5/5 - if you want a cute outdoor dinner spot where you don't have to worry about weather, this is it!Food 3/5 - The best thing I tried was the cheeks appetizer (like a savory milanesa), which I would actually recommend! Now here's where things go downhill.. for the squid appetizer, I actually liked the beans on the plate more then the squid itself. The burger I ordered wasn't bad, but just note that they will cook it medium-well-ish (3 of us ordered the burgers, and none of us were asked how we wanted it cooked).Two in our party got the pork chop, and one of them looked pretty pink after cutting it. The other looked as expected and tasted fine. We asked the server if the pink was alright and he insisted that since all the meat is brined at least 24 that the chicken and pork are safe to eat pink. Our friend still felt a bit uncomfortable with the coloration (hesitant but super nice about it) so the waiter said no problem and took the plate back. When he returned, it was with the same plate of food (still cut up), so they didn't remake the dish and just reheated it. Felt really sketch to be honest, but our table isn't one to fuss so we just let it go.To end the meal, we had a chocolate mousse dessert with a little candle for our friend's birthday, which was nice.Would I come back again for the food? No. Would I come back again to enjoy the cute patio with some friends? Yeah.I heard the brunch is really nice, so I'll have to check that out sometime if I decide to update my review,Always satisfying and the food won't disappoint you at all. Great quality of food options and decent taste. The place was wonderful too. The inside setting was great but outside dining setting was really fantastic.The menu was excellent. The lamb shank was so good taste great and has well-balanced flavor, so tender as well. The salad was fresh and dessert was amazing. Love the food so much. Our server was prompt and friendly as well.,Time & Date: Saturday, Sep 25th 2021 @ 1pmReservation: made 1 day before on open tableCrowd: busy during brunch hoursDining: outdoor dining onlyI was drawn to Fable because of the beautiful garden patio dining area in the ""backyard"" of the restaurant. The garden patio area is open rain or shine, & there are heat lamps for the chillier days. All the trees & plants remind me of the Conservatory of Flowers in GG Park, I loved the ambience! Red Quinoa Brunch Bowl with Poached Eggs & Avocado - $14This bowl has green beans, brussels sprouts, scallion, & arugula, tossed in a honey-lemon vinaigrette. Definitely a very healthy choice & surprising filling. I can tell the veggies were super fresh, but the avocado had some browning. Fable's 1/2 lb. Deluxe Cheeseburger w/ House Cut Fries - $14I ordered the single patty burger which has aioli, lettuce, tomato, grilled onion, & pickles, on a house made brioche Bun. The burger was very tall, hugely because the brioche bun was quite thick. The bottom of my bun was burnt which made it hard. It's a solid burger with all your typical toppings & a well seasoned patty. My favorite part of this dish were the fries though - they were so well seasoned and salted BUT 70% of my fries were scraps! Not sure if I got the last of the batch or something but I would have preferred full length fries lol. I ordered orange juice & it came in the tiniest 8 oz glass, for a whopping $4! It wasn't very cold & I'm pretty sure it was not fresh squeezed (though it doesn't claim to be). Overall; it's a very cute restaurant with an amazing outdoor ambience. Food is fresh & generally healthy but slightly overpriced.,Beautiful outdoor space with their large patio outside in the back. It's covered as well and have some greenery to make it super welcoming and peaceful. Our group came in at different times and they were accommodating to seat the group that was already there. Give kudos to the space and the service but the food was OK. If you have a sweet tooth highly recommend their chocolate chip banana bread. It's on the sweeter side but what way to start brunch that with dessert? As for my main entree I ended up getting the eg sandwich which wasn't that bad but the bread was too tough for me and fell apart making it a little messier to eat. It's a nice twist with the blue cheese spread with the arugula that added some change to your standard breakfast sandwich.  It's filling though so if you want something to fill you up this would be a good option since it also came with a side of fries. We also got an order of the Chilaquiles Puebla which seemed like a super popular dish as others around us were ordering it as well. It was a nice crunchy dish and sauce was flavorful so if you want something out of your usual brunch menu this is a good option.,Very simple menu with a handful of items. Food was good and came out quick, really enjoyed the home style fries and the aioli dipping sauces. Our waitress was quick and on top of it for having a full patio and the only one serving!,I made a reservation on OpenTable for the back garden patio.  We arrived early and were seated right away.  It was raining that day but everything was completely covered.  The garden patio is really cute and is the perfect setting for brunch.  The inside seemed a little dark and there weren't that many tables.  The menu was on the smaller side for brunch but that's expected and i",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" was still a great selection.  Food was good but I didn't leave feeling super full (hence the 4 stars).  Service was great; super friendly and very quick.  Parking is definitely difficult in this area but we lucked out with a spot right in front.  It's definitely a cute """"girls"""" brunch spot and I'd recommend sitting in the patio over inside.",Came here for brunch. So pretty inside at their backyard patio. Our margaritas hit the spot. I ordered the chilaquiles which were just okay. I've had better ones but still enjoyed my meal. My friend got the Benedict and enjoyed it. Would recommend this place!,Had a lovely dinner here a few weeks ago. The lasagna was very good and I also enjoyed the wine selection," but the main appeal at Fable is the outdoor garden atmosphere. It is such a beautiful area. Most of the tables are for two so it creates a very sweet environment of many groups of people on dates or catching up one on one. Make sure you reserve """"standard seating"""" to sit in the garden", otherwise you will get put on the converted sidewalk seating, which is not as appealing.,I've come to Fable a handful of times now and each time has been a 5 star rating in my opinion. I've only been for lunch and the menu is small but there is an option for everyone. I think what keeps me coming back is how nice everyone is that works here and the ambiance. The patio is gorgeous and there is no bad place to sit. I think i've has the same server each time and i'm not sure of her name but she has long brown hair and is so kind. No matter how busy this place is, she has always came to check on us and take care of whatever we need. The inside hostesses are also very nice, overall everyone here is so nice. The food come out pretty quick and is very yummy. I've only tried the sandwiches but they are always filling and delicious. The drink menu is small too but there is a decent selection of wines. This last time around my boyfriend and i both ordered sandwiches and coffee and our bill came out to around $50. I think that's a fair price for the excellent service and beautiful ambiance at this restaurant. Make sure to make a reservation!! Not sure how walk ins are and also parking isn't the greatest but not impossible (:,I had my birthday brunch here last year and it was a good time. I ordered sangria and they were not cheap on the alcohol. Feeling buzzed after one drink. Haha! Probably because it was 10am in the morning. Their food was delicious too. The environment is so cute. I am a plant lover. Their patio had this get away from the city feeling. A quiet spot on a busy street. Loved it!,Wonderful American food! For sides, the mac n cheese and roasted cauliflower were delectable - probably could've just had the large mac & cheese as its own dish. The pan-roasted chicken was so tender, probably some of the best chicken we've ever had and the garden veggies were extremely fresh too which was super nice. The pork chop was also delicious.We came at 6pm on a Sunday and were able to get a table right away outside!,Food aside, I would go here again for the adorable back patio. We were a large group dining at the tail end of lunch service on a weekday, so we nearly had the entire thing to ourselves. We were a large group so it worked out perfectly. The majority of us ordered the fired egg sandwich. This was a first for me. Who would have thought such a simple thing, could be so filling and delicious. I think it was the gorgonzola spread that made it so yummy.My only tiny gripe is they did not offer draft beer. and I had seen a menu previously that said they had a vegan lasagna. I was kind of looking forward to that, but no longer saw it on the lunch or dinner menu. I had a original choosen this place based on a couple of vegan options that seem to be no longer. Hopefully, with the recent surge in the vegan diet it will return.,I love the STAFF so much here. I used to go here every single weekend because I live a block away. The back garden is heaven and the food is great... so specials would not hurt for us regulars. But this is what I think of when I think of classic SF brunch in the Castro:) and it ain't expensive:),I have to admit that I chose this restaurant because I was curious about the garden patio. Now I can say that it's really cute. For sure during the day you enjoy the outdoor area more (we went here for dinner), but the ambience at night is nice (maybe too loudly for me). We had reservation at 8:45pm, but when we arrived almost 20 minutes earlier, our table was already ready. I think it could be nice if there is the possibility to be notified about your table state (I'm just thinking). I ordered the burger, while my husband the pork chops (we didn't share anything this time) and two glasses of wine. My burger was good (not the best around SF). I liked the type of cheese they use. My husband loved the pork chop. He said it was really juicy and yummy. I trust him even though I couldn't grab any bite. I enjoyed my Californian Cabernet Souvignon. They have a good wine selections by class (many of them are from Italy).  Overall, we enjoyed our evening. The service was pretty good. We'll come again to enjoy the brunch in the gorgeous garden.,Came here on a Friday night with a reservation for outdoor patio. We were seated immediately for a party of four with our reservation. The vibes of the outdoor patio was beautiful especially at night, loved the plants and lights they had.4/5 Food: For appetizers we ordered the tuna tartar, mac and cheese, fries, and brussles. Overall everything was just okay...nothing really stood out but everything tasted good. For entrees we got the vegan lasagna, burger, and the halibut. I couldn't really taste the uni for the halibut and the burger was kind of dry. 5/5 Service: Our waitress was amazing and she always refilled our water and wine glass. Overall I would come back for a girls or date night because it was such a great ambiance and I had an amazing time.,Great food! and very cute garden in the back! great ambiance, service was great! Have been multiple times,Delicious brunch spot. Book a reservation, so you can sit in their outdoor garden patio. It's such a vibe!Got the trout eggs benedict, which comes with a mixed green salad, no potatoes. It's a healthier option that way, but I didn't even think about how most places usually include a side of potatoes, so I kind of missed it. The trout, eggs, and hollandaise were so good! My only complaint is I wish there had been more trout...My friends had the fried chicken sandwich and the omelette. They both said their dishes were ok, which is why I give this place 4 stars. I live in the Richmond, so I didn't leave thinking I can't wait to come back here! But if you live nearby, definitely check it out! But make a reservation.,I absolutely love Fable's brunch menu. Their banana bread is a must have! The two times that I've visited , I've always had to order it. I wondered what was in their butter that stood out, and I was told that is has honey in it. Their eggs Benedict was delish! Also, their French toast was a delight! Our server Dylan made our experience magical! One of the best servers that I've ever had! Dylan went above and beyond to meet our needs and to even add lemon to my hot water, that was a nice touch! I shall return another time and try more things.,Walked up to the place and noticed the small patch of seating in the front. Nice peaceful greenery in the crazy city. As we went inside we waited a little bit, the hostess wasn't there, but was told she'd be back. After a few minutes of waiting she came to the front and seated us in the back. It was an amazing garden scenery with a freshness to it. She seated us right in the sun because that was the only 2 person table. Now I get they want to keep the 4 person table for bigger parties because they spend more money but come on. Anyway, The poor waiter looked like he was juggling more tables then he should have but he tried his best. He was able to move us to another table out of the sun. The wait for the food wasn't long. But because he has a lot of tables it took him a bit longer then expected. Again, he tried his best. The food was amazing, I kept it simple and got the burger and fries and my husband got the healthy sandwich (I think it was squash). I had to keep swatting his hand away from the fries (that's what you get when you try and eat healthy ‍)Anyway def suggest this place. Great food and scenery.,To start, Fable has so many seating options! Outdoors out front, indoor, and in their back outdoor garden... personally, I think the back is the best spot.Service was amazing, and the food was delicious! I was weary on getting vegan lasagna because I don't love a strong squash taste, but WOW! It was the best lasagna I've had. Everything we ate was excellent, but if you're between a few options, lasagna is my recommendation. Enjoy!,Came here for a late lunch. We were greeted by the host and had a reservation.We sat out back and the back is so cute and refreshing. Service was great and quick. I had the oven roasted turkey sandwich, with white wine and French fries. The bread was so soft, all tastes fresh and quality.,The back patio is a dining oasis! It feels as though you're in a friend's beautiful backyard....but instead, you're in the Castro!My friend and I dined here for lunch on a weekday, and Fable has a range of menu items from burgers and sandwiches to salads. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich with fries (what can I say? I'm a glutton), and neither disappointed. The fried chicken sandwich was a very generous portion - so much so that I split it with my friend and didn't seem to miss out on the other half. The fries were crispy - yum. There was plenty of indoor seating, but the patio was completely full - luckily we had made a reservation. The back patio is on the cozy side, so you can definitely hear other conversations....and it can be tough to avoid very loud parties.,"How lucky have we been to find yet another Great dining experience! We are visiting  family here in SF and we have been going to places they know that have a good outside options .The first contact with the host and he is genuinely happy to see us and welcomes us dine.We walk out back to the outside dining and this is a """"wow"""" moment. Full of greens", wonderful outside, with nice chairs and benches that, as the waiter describe, hold the heat form the heaters - what a cozy corner we had!Super attentive wait staff and food timed very well including a take out order delivered hot as we paid the check,the meal was awesome, from the simple Caesar salad  to a pork chop with white beans, the meat was so tender I  could have just used my fork, the chicken was so juicy and the salmon grill with the pureed sweet potato elegantly served and nothing leftover!The espresso was a light but a good portion, and the olive oil cake was a perfect ending, sweet, not so much so, light and loved the mint leave.A truly wonderful dining experience!,Great service, great food and a nice ambiance. My kind of vibes. We ordered the caprese salad to start. Very good but a little smaller than I anticipated.The 8oz NY Steak which was bigger than I thought it would be. Great flavors and cooked perfectly! I subbed the asparagus for bok choy since I'm allergic but was also cooked well! Baked Mac n cheese was also very good! Perfect amount of cheese to noodle to crumb topping For dessert we had the Bread Pudding and the Rubarb Crisp and bother were good and but I think I liked the bread pudding a bit more.Our server was amazing and took good care of us. He recommended a great Cabernet to go with our steaks and the friend I was with mentioned she was allergic to nuts and he made sure to recommend a dessert that had no nuts. (NOTE: the Rubarb crisp has a walnut topping)I would definitely recommend this place!,Simple menu packed with quality comfort food! Great flavors, generous portions, and a lively back patio that feels like you've left the city.,I made a reservation online via OpenTable. They have a 15-minute grace period for reservations in case you're running late. They don't have physical menus, instead they have QR Codes that you can scan to view the menu online. They also don't have an extensive menu compared to other popular brunch spots in the city.I ordered a fried chicken sandwich, which is a hefty meal. The fried chicken was cooked spectacularly as the exterior was crispy and delectable while retaining a juicy interior.  They give a large helping of fries which were ok, once they cooled down though they weren't as good.We dined at their outdoor patio which was super cute- the only downside was that it was super cold and windy that day. Our food cooled down incredibly fast because of this. Also, they check was given to us as an receipt clipped by a paper clip that almost flew away because of the wind- maybe they can get those black booklets or something more sturdy?,Memorable experience! Walked-in without reservation on Friday night - (reservation recommended) Waiters were attentive and professional.Food was delicious - my cheese hamburger was yummy delicious ; and those French fries were crispy warm with good flavor. Recommended,The back covered patio is a nice casual venue. My party and I were thrilled that it was a quiet dining space, maybe due to not having music for people to shout over.The food was utterly ordinary. Our NY Strip steak was quite chewy, the asparagus was the thickest we had ever seen, the potato and chard gratin was quite good. The bread pudding was delicious.The server sort of rushed us and prompted us into making decisions. Not sorry I went, but probably won't go again.,This is our first time dining here. I have been looking for a great brunch spot that's not too far away from where I live (I live in SF) when we normally travel towards San Mateo or Millbrae for brunch. Parking was easy since we parked a few blocks away on castro street and walked. This is normally a busy area but we made reservations and picked the earliest spot (right when they open) to get ample choice of seating. They did not disappoint. Welcome by a lovely host and our reservation was honored immediately. They have indoor seating available but we chose the outdoor instead for the ambiance. The heating lamp was perfect (we sat on tall chairs and barstools) and was very comfortable on a table for 2 next to a lush garden with water fountains that give you that zen feeling. Our server Edgar was very attentive and we were able to make our selections (see photos below) with ease. We came for lunch as brunch was only available on weekends (boohoo-- I wanted to try their french toast and pancakes!) we will have to come back another time. A glass of Rosé went well with our cobb salad and fried chicken sandwich. My husband and I shared each meal and it was perfect. We didn't like the very full feeling and the price was what we expected having dined in SF (especially Castro). Chicken was soft on inside and crispy on outside. Cobb salad was great and it was perfect with no additional meat. We ordered an extra side of house fries for lunch.Overall I highly recommend this place! We may come back just for brunch and make our way to Hot cookie afterwards for dessert with coffee from Philz. Lol,Fable is a great lunch option, with a handful of sandwiches and salads on the menu. The back patio was already full when we went for a Monday lunch but fortunately there was still some parklet seating for our group of 4! Tasty food and nice service. Make a reservation if you want to ensure seating, especially in the back patio.,This is such a cute place! I've never been here & was looking for outdoor seating with heat lamps. They had outside seating in the front and patio in the back. We sat in the back patio which was very cute. Great place for pandemic outdoor seating! Customer service was great as well. I recommend and would come here again.,We came here for brunch and on the outside, it looked just okay and the menu was pretty limited and prices were a little high BUT I was pleasantly surprised on how nice it was in the patio. The ambiance is great. I love the pretty plants and the arrangement of the patio. We made reservation for 2:15pm on Saturday in advance. When we came and checked in at 2:15pm, we were told that the kitchen would be closing in 10 minutes. I was taken aback. Why would they offer reservations all the way up to 3pm but not inform their customers that kitchen won't be open. Why would I make reservation for a limited drink menu? I thought that was bad on their part. Be clear with their reservation times and what they could offer at those hours; otherwise, don't allow us to make reservation if you can't serve us food. Anyway, everything worked out. We were able to get our food. The staff was also very friendly. The food was good. It's not amazing but it's solid. I got the fried chicken sandwich and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. The seasonal mimosa was also good. Overall, it was a nice experience despite the small hiccup.,Beautiful back patio and friendly service. Good portion sizes. However, not quite 5-star worthy IMHO. The lunch menu wasn't too exciting and I ended up with [a pretty basic order of] grilled chicken sandwich with fries. My friend ordered the butter lettuce salad and a side of focaccia. My sandwich was fine (said to be our waiter's favorite item on the menu), but the fries were not that fresh tasting. I tried a bit of my friend's focaccia and was underwhelmed. It was toasted, which is odd for focaccia. Instead of being soft, it was overly crispy (and hard). She ate about one piece of the five or so logs. I'm willing to give it another shot for brunch or dinner and update my review.,Came here for brunch and it was in the cutest back space ever. Small space so definitely recommend reservations. And they keep true to their word as they nudge you out when your time is up.Food was pretty decent. We got the mimosa carafe and chocolate chip banana bread for the table. Warm, moist and crispy all in one. I got the trout Benedict and it was very tasty. It was a nice touch not being on regular English muffin. Burger was solid and very filling. Chilaquiles was meh. Added ham and it was like deli ham thrown in it.Feels like most items would be pretty good. Would come back with friends for the nice ambience.,Staff was friendly, food was tasty, and with a chill and relaxed atmosphere. I did not know I would need a reservation but since I went on a not very busy time I was able to get a table,I come here quarterly for a team lunch. The experience is consistently great. Our servers are always lovely and knowledgeable about the food and wine, even the natural wines. The back deck is suck a wonderful atmosphere with all the plants, it's like dining in a secret garden. We have never been disappointed with the food, great salads and sandwiches.,Amazing and quick service. Great value and beautiful outdoor dining. We came several times for brunch before but this was the first time for dinner and it was romantic and delicious. The atmosphere was relaxed. Ceasar salad, pork cheek salad, pork chop, lamb shank, and Mac and cheese were all winners.  The wait staff were superb and everything about the experience was great. I would visit again and again, worth every penny!,Came here for lunch. It was very good. Had the fried chicken sandwich. Thin layer of the crispy chicken skin, chicken and slice of crispy bacon with cabbage in a warm toasted bread.  Ate in the cute patio in the back.,I have been coming to this restaurant for years. I love this place and their gorgeous plants' patio - great atmosphere with a sense of right lightning and  intimacy. Either for brunch/lunch or dinner, I love their food. My faves are the Mixed Melon Salad with Crispy Prosciutto, for starters; Seared Sesame Crusted Tombo Tuna with Mizo Glaze, Vegan Summer Squash Lasagna, the Grilled NY Steak and the Pan Roasted Chicken Breast, for mains. For wine pairing, I enjoy for reds: their Pinot Noir, Le Machin (from Santa Maria), their Rosato Sangiovese Pink DOC (from Toscana/Italy) - when they have DAOU Cabernet Sauvignon I can't resist to it; for whites I go for: the Dry Riesling Trefethen (from Napa Valley/CA), the Albariño (from Lodi/CA) and the Chardonnay Capensi (from Stellenboch/South Africa). For dessert I usually choose the Affogato Corretto or the Bitter Sweet Chocolate Mousse. The service has always been excellent and with the right pace between dishes - Staff makes us feel welcomed and at home. I definitely recommend this restaurant.,Beautiful patio dining! We had absolutely delicious sandwiches, french fries and wine. The staff go above and beyond to be helpful and the food is fantastic. I would definitely come back again. I had a hamburger with bacon and fries and it was delicious. The portions are reasonable and the prices are too. This is a winner.,I'm sure the food is delicious and I look forward to trying it, but apparently they close from 2:45pm-4:45pm even though there's no mention of this online, there website has them home for lunch until 3pm. I showed up at 2:45 to place a lunch order and they told me that they closed at 2:45 conveniently. Also don't bother calling to place an order, I tried calling repeatedly since 2:15pm and there was no answer.,Such a cute spot!Went here for lunch on a Friday - we booked some tables via the Yelp site an hour before driving over (highly recommend making a reservation as they do book up fast). They have their brunch menu available until 3 on weekdays.The outdoor patio is so cute! A breath of fresh air in the city (quite literally). We got the fried chicken sandwich with a side of fries and it was wonderful (with a sweet brioche bun)Staff are extremely friendly and helpful, an overall pleasant atmosphere. Would highly recommend coming here!,Pretty courtyard but pretty bad food.Burger tastes like something that was just thawed out. Certainly better food at other places nearby.,Found this place on Yelp, decided to try this place. Haven't been around sf dining in awhile and wanted to eat in the Castro. Friendly service and beautiful outside patio. Ordered our food and I was somewhat perplexed ...roast beef sandwich with chicken a jus? And asked server to get beef a jus, took about 7-8 mins to get it. Came out and the a jus looked like beef gravy. The roast beef needs more seasoning. The salad was great presentation, but dressing is waaaaay to salty!! Salted finger potatoes and olives included in the salad.P.s. got my bill and there was charge of fries on my Oder that I didn't know about. The roast beef doesn't come with fries?! Server never asked or told me there will be a charge on fries even though it's only $1.50 salad 4/10Roast beef sandwich 4/10Fries 5/10 (top ones are crunchy, bottom soggy from something),This place was so cute!!! If you're in the Castro district and want to dine somewhere romantic, this is your spot! No joke, this place is by far magical. From the food to the ambiance, this place is perfect. Staff is super friendly. Making reservations through Open Table app, I highly suggest it. This place does get busy and if you have no reservations, you're likely not to be seated as there's limited seating.Came here 'cause I was browsing locations for a romantic/or fun restaurant and this poppes up on search results. Later that day upon searching, my Tik Tok app had a video that showed Fable, the restaurant. Instantly, I knew I had to book a dining experience here. My plus one and I enjoyed our evening with great conversation and laughter while eating delicious food. This place is perfect during coronavirus times. Outdoor seating woth lovely plants all around.For starters, we had the macaroni and cheese. Simply devine! Crusted cheese with light breading, it was way too good. I had a seasoned chicken breast over mash potatoes and greens. Flavor to thr max and not dry, as I was a bit worries before ordering. Nope, it met my expectations. My date had a hamburger that looked ravishing. Portion size was good, he had no complaints.,4.5/5I re-visited for brunch with my friends and I have to say I need to revise my review for their brunch over their other times of day. Unfortunately, we got seated at the same exact table as last time which was not a great ambiance. BUT, the food was tenfold times better and I'll definitely be going back.We got:- Pancakes: these were probably some of the best pancakes I've ever had. I definitely will be getting this next time we go there.- Ricotta Omelette: a solid omelette with ricotta and butternut squash and spinach inside. It really hit the spot. - Chilaquiles: always a fave for breakfast, these don't disappoint. Albeit, they are not the most authentic of course. - Fried Chicken Sandwich: a great pick always, their's is not exception. The staff was friendly and we were seated in a quick manner in accordance to our reservation. I highly recommend that you go for their brunch.,How is it possible that I've never been to Fable before? A magical place with the most beautiful garden patio I've seen - multiple levels, a roof for wetter weather, amazing plants - just gorgeous. Had lunch with a friend who is leaving San Francisco after many years and this couldn't have been a better choice. First, I really think they have one of the nicest, friendliest staffs in the city - super welcoming. We each had sandwiches - my friend had the the Fried Chicken and she (a true fried chicken aficionado) raved about it. I chose the Oven Roasted Turkey Club and it was perfect - really fresh and delicious. Top that off with my favorite - a super tangy Arnold Palmer - and we were two very happy ladies. Now I want to take everyone I know here - I can't think of a place I'd rather be than that incredible garden!,Came here with friends and we sat in their back garden/patio it was a really nice I love the way the place is covered with plants. What I will personally get on the menu is the French toast and the chicken sandwich with bacon. Another tip too is that you can bring your own alcohol they just charge you a cork fee. Will definitely come back.,Beautiful back patio that is all the rage right now with COVID protocols. The food is delicious too - albeit a little pricey. I hear the HH is really worth it but we never get there early enough. The green goddess salad was my favorite!,FLAVOR (3.5/5): Tried their fried chicken sandwich and it wasn't anything spectacular! As all of Bay Area is coming out with their own fried chicken sandwiches, I didn't find this one competitive at all. Their sweet potato chips, also were more rubbery than crispy. INSTAGRAM WORTHY (5/5): The outdoor patio in the back is breathtaking with all the plants you are surrounded by. It's like eating in a jungle but with heat lamps! Appreciate all the decor to make your dining experience worth while. SERVICE (4/5): Friendly staff, did check ins with us but left us alone for the most part which I appreciate! We didn't have a reservation but they still took the chance to give us a table right away. TAKEAWAYS: I find their menu for lunch super limited, a little too picked over in my opinion. Not only that," but their prices are on the steeper end. You're paying double for a """"fancier"""" version of what you'll get at an equally tasty place perhaps 15 miles away. Would come back for the ambiance but not the food.",This restaurant deserves a standing ovation! I was absolutely impressed with their excellent service - every encounter with the members of their team was perfect as they truly understand customer service. I reserved the outdoor patio for a private 22 person birthday party for a Sunday Brunch. From the very beginning the owner, Ramsey, was so kind. Even on a busy weekend, he walked me through the space to show me the layout and patiently answered all of my questions. The outdoor patio is a fairytale just as the name suggests. But it's also a space that's genuine where you can have a semi-private or private event surrounded by people you love. The food and drinks were delicious as well!The true star of the show was Marda and her team. Throughout the month leading up to the event she attentively emailed back and forth with me, answering my questions and guiding me through the process. It calmed my nerves to see her there on the day of the event and have her staff help me set up and take care of my guests so I could just enjoy the party. I cannot thank her, Ramsey and the team enough for helping me host such a memorable event!,Visiting an old stomping ground is an interesting experience - the Castro was a staple of my first few years in SF and it's undergone a transformation in the era of COVID. The bars are now outside and it's refreshingly buzzing with energy for those of us exhausted by the lockdowns of the past year. I've always wanted to try this place - I heard they had a great patio for outdoor dining (they do!) and decided to catch up with a friend for dinner.  We shared the pork cheeks, avocado Dungeness crab tower, mussels, lamb chops, baked Mac n' cheese (topped with crab) and pear ginger crisp. Everything was excellent but the baked n' cheese topped with Dungeness crab was the highlight of that meal. The best of it was the burnt bits (kinda the burnt rice on a bibimbap).  Crab season also just opened and the side of crab on top was the perfect accompaniment.  The lamb chop was also a special dish, particular with the Parmesan gnocchi and mint sauce. Service was good and the patio indeed lived up to expectations. With tax and tip, this was $80 per person. Just a great dining experience and highly recommended!!!,One of the cutest patios in sf to have brunch! Easy to make a reservation and food was great. No sub for blue cheese but I liked that it was different. I'm usually not a blue cheese girl but it was good.,3.5 stars Fable has a beautiful outdoor dining patio and the staff are wonderful. However I could never recommend a restaurant just based on the fluff and not the food and I was not very impressed by the food. I got: - Mac and cheese: made with white cheese. Did not like the flavor. But BF really did like it. - Dijon crusted pork: don't really like pork so I felt like the meat was meh but the kale salad it came with was 10/10 and I hate kale.  - burger: just really meh. The cheese was interesting it was clumping and really sticky. The yellow sauce that came with the fries was great - vegan lasagna: once again, just meh for me. BF Really liked it. I feel like the reviews on Yelp are based more on ambience than food. Menu is small so limited options per protein.,What a great neighborhood spot!  Warm welcoming staff...amazingly beautiful garden back patio...surrounded with plants and hidden spaces.  Loved spending some late morning time here on a warm Sunday.  The food was delicious and with such a variety on the menu there are lots of great plates to choose from.  Brunching sips for every palate to enjoy.  Will definitely return to share in this lovely spot.,I really wanted to like Fable. Maybe it was because we came for drinks and dinner instead of brunch, but our experience, and service, were rather mediocre. Vegan lasagna and fries were tasty but expensive for the portions, and wine was ok but nothing spectacular. The patio in Fable is beautiful, although sadly we didn't get to see much of it since we were seated next to the door and the beverages.Brunch experiences seem to be better so maybe come then if you're itching for a visit.,Patio is nice. Food is just ok and coffee is v bad. There are better brunch places in SF.,Fable is sooooo cute! Wow! Such a gem in the castro. It has the most beautiful back patio filled with plants and music and good vibes. Great place to go celebrate with friends or just have a casual brunch. The drinks were super good and the food was delicious too. the staff were incredibly friendly, and we felt very happy to be there. it was my birthday brunch, so i felt like the stakes were high, and they impressed! I would recommend making a reservation or getting there early though because they get busy and don't really slow down until closing, so don't get lost in the line! just make a res. and wear layers.,Been here before and had a good experience on the back patio, but stopped by for brunch recently and had a pretty miserable time. We didn't have a reservation and instead of letting us know about how long the wait was we were rather rudely told that people typically make reservations a couple weeks in advance. There was an open table and we were seated quickly. (Guess a resy wasn't so necessary) We were told they were going to grab us some water, but that never came. We had to ask for someone to take our order after waiting a very long time. We had to ask for water again because it never came. We just felt like they forgot our table existed. Once we were finally able to order the food did come out quickly, but was rather boring. The chicken sandwich was crispy, but lacked any distinguishing flavours and no one likes a floppy French fry. We sat waiting for our check after a disappointing meal for way too long and overall wished we had picked somewhere else. I hope this was just an off day because I've heard good things about their dinner.,I came here after Covid19 restrictions were lifted. We sat in the back patio during a beautiful day. The one thing I didn't like was that our server was very clueless about checking if we were good. We waited over 30 minutes just to get water or drinks. But the two other servers saved the day by being super attentive so that would be my negative critique of them. Food:Eggs Benedictspinach, poached eggs, hollandaise, mixed greens - added avocadoRed Quinoa Brunch Bowl with Poached Eggs & Avocadogreen and yellow zucchini, arugula, honey-lemon vinaigrette Sandwichover-medium eggs, gorgonzola spread, bacon, arugula, honey-lemon vinaigrette - added bacon & avocadoDrinks:My friends had mimosas, Rose, and water. The drinks very good.I definitely love the upgrades you guys have made since the last time I came. I also love how clean your bathrooms are and I appreciated that. One other friendly tip is to make sure there's enough shade in the back as it was very hot the time I went. Thanks again for everything.,"Food was just okay for me. I got the trout Benedict and added avocado to it. I liked the dish but wasn't crazy about it because the hollandaise sauce was okay and bread I wasn't a big fan of (too dry for me). The side salad I felt was a waste or could've been a better side dish for brunch. Maybe the portions were big enough for me. The Blood orange mimosas were good though! Service was nice and outdoor seating/patio is nice but I wasn't too crazy about the food.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Beretta,"Every time I come here I am never disappointed. This place has all the right vibes and not to mention the super friendly staff! All that is just the icing on the cake as the FOOD is  always delish. I get something different every time and can honestly say that I haven't gotten this tasty of Italian food for such a reasonable price. Beretta stays my favorite local NoPa restaurant. :),This is my first time at Beretta for a birthday dinner. The food and drinks were fantastic. We ordered the walnut bread, meatballs, and crab arancini to start. All very delicious. Then order the Brussels sprouts and the bartenders pizza (I highly recommend this) For drinks, we had the Diablo and Kentucky Mule. I'm sad I didn't get to take pictures because everything was so delicious that all my focus was on how good the food was. I can guarantee I will return to try more delicious food and cocktails.,Our Bluey show & Embarcadero plans were ruined so we decided to goto Beretta. It was my second visit. The staff is great. Everyone's smiling and constantly checking on guests. There's a nice ambiance w/seating that forces you to engage and/or be nosey & eavesdrop. One of our servers was a dashing young man (reminded me a lot of myself). The food & drinks were excellent. We beat the evening crowd which starts around 6ish which I recommend doing. I didn't get pics of the  marinated castelvetrano -olives citrus, fennel (the nutty fennel tasted great w/the olives), walnut bread -burrata, mushroom-truffle honey (I'm not fond of nuts in food but this was excellent), crab arancini -calabrese aioli (crab stuffed rice ball) was delicious!! The calabrese aioli was the perfect sauce too! It's San Francisco so parking comes at the luck of the draw. Once inside, you'll have a memorable experience.,My office had our holiday party here and I was given to honor to help select the menu for the evening, since I'm the foodie of our office. We were able to select a few antipasti, salad, pizza, mains and dessert. For the antipasti I selected the walnut bread, herb onion focaccia, crab arancini and meatballs. For the salad, I went with the roasted beets, since it was different from the usual caesar salad everybody offers at other restaurants. For the pizza, I chose the margherita with burrata and the bartender's pizza. The mains, I went with the mushroom risotto, canelloni di magro and butternut squash ravioli. And for the dessert, the panna gelato.I highly recommend the walnut bread with burrata, mushroom-truffle with honey. So tasty and a good starter. The meatball was tasty and tender, paired well with the spicy sauce. It was a mixed bag for the beets salad. Some really liked it, others didn't like it at all, pretty much due to the goat cheese and the chunks of beet were kinda big. I thought it was okay. I was able to try both pizzas. Burrata on the pizza is so good. The bartender's had a nice spice to it and the marg was simple and saucy. The crowd pleaser was the canelloni di magro and that went fast, since each table only got like one plate of it. The panna cotta was delicious! But 2 bowls per table with 2 scoops of ice cream and we all had to share and dip our spoons in it?! Especially during these Covid and Flu times...come on now.We were reserved their private room in the back and the layout of the room was not cutting. It was not comfortable for 40+ people to move around without having to squeeze between tables and move chairs, it was pretty cramped. We had about 6 tables that was supposed to accommodate 8-10 people. Each table was supposed to get 2 of each dish/item but that didn't happen. My table was closest to the entrance were they brought food. We received 2 walnut breads on a platter (5 pieces each), 1 plate of focaccia (sliced with about 8-10 pieces), 1 plate of meatballs (8-10 pieces), 1 plate of crab arancini balls (8 pieces), 1 bowl of salad, 1 bowl of mushroom risotto, 2 plates of butternut squash ravioli (5 pieces each), 1 of each pizza (sliced into 6 pieces), a bowl of their canelloni di magro and 2 bowls of their panna gelato. Yes, my table did receive everything on the menu but not everybody was able to try all the pizza. And we could only take one of each item. It was like a sampling more than a dinner.A few tables behind me didn't receive some dishes. Some were missing the butternut ravioli or they didn't get enough food. It was pretty disappointing and it shouldn't have happened. Some of my coworkers and their guest were still hungry after, so they went home and ate, lol. And if they were full, it's because they filled up on dranks. The following day my bosslady texted some of my coworkers individually to ask if their table received all the dishes. They replied that not everybody at their table was able to try a dish and if they did, it could only be a costco size sample. They mentioned some dishes even came out late or when people were already leaving. They were displeased at the service as well.Our office was also doing a white elephant gift exchange and it was a pain for people to get up to go over to the designated gift table, showcase the gift and hear each other. The restaurant, overall is pretty loud so you have to get really close to people to talk or ask them to repeat themselves. We did have a personal bartender and he had a helper, but 1.5 persons was not fast enough to handle 40+ people. The person helping him was also helping pass out the dishes to tables. It took forever and a day to get a drink. Each person was allotted 2 drink tickets. A person joked to the people just arriving to put in their drink order because it's going to be a while before you could get your drink, lol. If you wanted to see the menu you had to scan their QR code. Would've been nice to have at least one physical drink menu.We were initially going to roll 47 people deep and my bosslady was paying per head. Unfortunately, 2 people couldn't make it. So there should've been some extra food, right?Overall, I would not recommend this place for a private party, unless your party is smaller than 40 peeps or even less. They should've had 2 bartender's fulfilling drink orders at the same time. For the price that my office paid it was so not worth! Not enough food, cramped space, long waits for drinks and difficulty parking. My friend and I circled the block 3 times before deciding to park by alamo square.,This one's been on my list for a while and was excited to try! We came for a late dinner and split two pizzas and dessert.+ loved the thin crust, margherita pizza was rly good! We got it with burrata so yum+ they had the carbonara pizza even tho it wasn't on this locations menu (not as good as Cotogna tho)+ desserts were rly good!+ we didn't have to wait since we came late around 9 pm on a Fri - was very dark inside, some might like the moody dark vibe, felt like it was closed or was a bit weird to me lol,For about $10 for a piece of tiramisu, it's extremely disappointing. Perhaps the tiramisu was previously frozen,  but by the time it got to my house,  there was a pool of liquid sitting at the bottom of the to-go container. Perhaps it could've been forgiven if that brownish liquid was rum, or even coffee, but it was just water. The only edible portion was the top layer of mascarpone because there was actually a creamy sweet taste. Any layers underneath just tasted like it was just soaked in water. Tasteless, wet,  no hint of coffee or rum. The most disgusting tiramisu I've ever eaten.,I love the Divisadero location! The restaurant has a great dining atmosphere that can get a little noisy, but has great service and great music. I've tried a handful of cocktails from this restaurant, all unique and delicious. I highly recommend amping-up any pizza with the burrata add-on (it is...so good). This is the perfect spot for a celebration or date night. I highly recommend visiting this place for their elevated pizza and night dining scene.,Quite an impeccable dining experience as the food was all thoroughly great. The walnut ricotta bread appetizer is a great way to start off. Light and just the right amount of burrata. They have a unique chili oil that I haven't seen at Italian restaurants. It has a strong kick to it which paired very well with both pasta and pizza. The bartender pizza is literally all you could want - good amount of meat, sauce, and burrata.,Pardon my low quality photo - but the food, service and drinks were .  We didn't have a rez - but came right at 7 w a party of 4 - got lucky and were seated at the bar - and delightfully served by a lovely gentleman who worked our dinner/drink orders, while owning the rest of the bar ops. Such finesse - well done. The squid ink risotto w calamari was to die for. The dirty martini - extra dirty. A rush of folks came just as we're were seated. Great place for a coed gatherings or romantic duos-- or even a solo trip for those not looking for any distraction.,I have been to this location twice now, and I have to say the food is great, and the service is always really good. However, the music is just so loud and kind of random, especially for an Italian restaurant. I came on a Sunday around 7pm, and it was fairly busy. We ordered a salad, an app, and shared two pizzas. We ordered the persimmon salad, which was really good, as well as the walnut bread appetiser. I wish there was more substance to the walnut bread, as it is kind of a small piece of bread with burrata. However, the pizzas were delicious. Thin crusts, definitely not soggy, and the sauces and toppings were delicious. We ordered the bartender's pie without meat, which was wonderfully balanced with the sauce and burrata.I would definitely return to Beretta again, but definitely try to make a reservation!,I had a casual dinner at the bar recently as the main dining room wasn't available for full dining as we arrived early, around 5:30PM cuz we were hungry. We shared the roasted beet & kale salad which was a big portion. It was a nice healthy start to our meal. My dining partner had the frutti del mare linguine & I had half of a burrata pizza. The pizza was light & thin crust (my favorite) & was so good that I ate 3 slices (it's not a big pie & features 6 slices). I had the Happy Flamingo cocktail & Spa Water cocktails which were balanced & flavorful.Service from our bar tender was friendly & helpful.,I thought the food at Beretta was pretty yummy. We had a birthday celebration of 30 celebrating my friends 30th birthday. There was a set menu with appetizers, entrees, and dessert. We ordered mixed drinks and cocktails prior to food coming out. The drinks were perfectly put together. I thought everything was up to par. The rice ball was a bit starchy and less creamy/ cheesy than I would've liked it to be. The walnut bread came out and it looked amazing- tasted as good as it looked. The arugula salad was standard. Brussel sprouts were cooked perfect topped with tasty bacon. The two pizzas (margarita and sausage) was probably my all time fav here. The squash rav was a bit sweet, probably wouldn't order it again. Topped it off with tiramisu. Service was good for such a large party. Ambiance was a bit loud for my liking. There was another big party next to us so I feel like we were competing on who's trying to be louder. All in all, looking forward to coming back to try some of their other pizzas and pastas.,The restaurant all around is a 10/10! The ambiance just puts you in a good mood with enjoying the company you're with. The waiter was very friendly and gave his honest opinion with what we wanted to orderWe ordered:herb onion focaccia -virgin olive oil The bread was nice and doughy with that crisp edge that I expect and enjoy with focaccia bread. The onion flavor was not overbearing and when dipped in the olive oil it gave a nice different level of flavor! persimmon salad -greens, pomegranate, walnuts, citrus We opted out of the walnuts due to an allergy but this was a great appetizer to have. The soft butter lettuce was lightly flavored from the refreshingly sweet citrus dressing and the persimmon and pomegranates were the perfect pair for this salad! If you're craving a sweet light side salad this is the one.squid ink risotto- with calamariOmg. This was so so soo good! They perfected how risotto should taste; it was so creamy, soft but not mushy.. this was the perfect medley of all the different flavors that was put into this dish where you could taste each ingredient but not one overpowering the other. You could taste the hint of lemon, the squid ink, and then you get a nice surprise of the crisp calamari when you bit into it. Perfectly seasoned dish. This dish made me think of wow the thought process the chef must've put into it. That's how much I enjoyed it, I hope you feel the same if you decide to order this!funghi misti- fontina valdostana, red onion, thyme Another yum in my book. If you love mushrooms you will not get disappointed with this pizza! You won't even miss the fact that it doesn't have meat! Again, the mushroom flavor is strong but it's not overwhelming. They know how to combine each ingredient where you can taste the different level of flavors but they perfected it to have everything pair together in a harmonious happy bite. The flavor of the mushroom with the creamy cheese and hint of onion was a satisfying first bite. I did ask for a side of hot sauce and when dipped it gave it a nice spice that cuts out from the creaminess of the cheese. Float 'n' stone- bourbon, lemon, apricot, peach, ipaIf you like ipa and bourbon you will enjoy this drink because you can taste both the carbonation from the ipa was different!,Good ambiance, good service but the restaurant is very loud and cold so it's difficult to talk.Lot of vegetarian options and my friend and I split a couple dishes. Really enjoyed the cauliflower and loved that they had a pizza option with both vegan meat and vegan cheese. I'd come back!,Came in an hour early from my reservation time and they sat us anyway since they weren't too busy. Although the host was really pretty, she wasn't very welcoming.We ordered the margherita with mushrooms and buratta and it was great. But I prefer the same pizza at their Valencia location. It tasted slightly better over there. The lobster arancini was pretty good we ordered two.The place is okay, and the server had been nice and friendly as well as the food runner.,The best valued happy hour in my opinion!Experience: My friend and I went here at 4pm. We were seated immediately. We sat outside and the outside seating area was nice. Our waiter was super cool and chill. The food and drinks came out quickly, which is great. Food: You can't go wrong with anything on the happy hour menu. I ordered one of everything, including drinks, expect for the wine. My favorite was the pizzetta gunghi. My friend's favorite was the cauliflower. For cocktails, my favorite was the Diablo. The Diablo is good if you like margs. My friend's was the Valencia. All the food and cocktails are under $10! Our total was $72 plus tax and tip.Split between two people, the happy hour menu is a great option that's not crazy expensive. I left full, happy, and little tipsy. I highly recommend!,My friends and I (a party of three) came here on a weekday night without a reservation and we were seated after about 15 minutes. We missed happy hour but still had a chance to each order Bad Reputation (tequila) and it was super yummy. Not too alcoholic tasting and still got me a little red and relaxed. I had the mushroom risotto and I loved it. Nothing bad to say about it because it was good. I tried my friend's pollo alla diavola and it was okay. There wasn't anything special about it and I wouldn't order it. I definitely would come here again for drinks and the food too!! Something to note, It's kinda loud indoors so it was hard to catch up with friends.,Jessie as an outstanding server. She was absolutely wonderful and made sure we were always checked up on. In my past I have never had such an amiable outstanding person be as helpful and sweet as she is. Beretta is lucky to have her. Food was decent and not as good as before but still delicious. Honestly, the service just made up for the slight disappointment in the food and I can not wait to be back here to eat again!,Checked this place out for the first time last night and was pleasantly surprised! Food came out quick and the service was great. We opted for the funghi pizza, lasagna and fried cauliflowers. It was also large enough to share between two people, which was nice. I'd say what really sets this place apart though is the ambiance and the drink selection. I ended up getting the Spa Water which is basically vodka, Prosecco, lemon and cucumber and it was delicious - both strong and sweet. My girlfriend went for the Madre which is a mezcal based drink - it was good but definitely on the stronger side. All in all, would definitely come back here again for the vibes, awesome drink selection and variety of pizza. Only taking a star off because although we had reservations, we still had to wait an additional 30 minutes thereafter. Tips: - Minimal parking, you'll need to drive around to find a spot - Located on a very busy street with lots to do, e.g. bars, arcades, parks- There are heaters outside but would still recommend bringing a jacket just in case,Really good place! My friend and I made reservations which was good seeing as how busy it got, however, the reservations didn't mention it would be outdoor seating with no heated lamp where we were :(Other than that, I really enjoyed the menu options. My friend and I ended up getting the Brussels sprouts (SO good omg, I love roasted Brussels), the Kale Beet salad and shared one of the pizzas. All delicious! They seemed to be running out of some menu options though, so be wary of that. Overall would def come back!,CURSE my immune system for preventing me from eating the walnut bread (judging from other reviews, that's probably what would bump Beretta up to 5 stars for me)!!My friend and I shared the meatballs (large and seasoned well) which sat in a divine tomato sauce that was perfect to dip the bread in. We also got the spicy Italian sausage pizza -- slightly greasy but delicious with a nice and crispy crust. Always appreciate seeing green onion utilized as an ingredient in non-Asian cooking as well. We finished the meal off with the biggest slice of tiramisu and left very happy.,Fun evening.  Great food.  Excellent wait staff.  And a charming conversation with the couple at the next table ... symphony musicians visiting from Australia.,We love Beretta! This is the second time I've been here, and the vibes, and the food were exquisite. our waitress was a little rude and short with us, but that did not ruin our time. I got the spa water cocktail, and then we proceeded to get the seafood pasta and the squid ink risotto. Both were absolutely delicious, just keep in mind that the squid ink risotto is very rich! We ended with the tiramisu, which I actually would not recommend. It wasn't very good, and I felt like the cake was too soaked in syrup. I wish they had some thing like a Panna cotta on the menu, since the food is very rich. great date spot location and delicious food! Will probably be back sometime soon,The things I like about this restaurant. First the food here is amazing we ordered four different kinds of pizza to appetizers one cauliflower one egg plant. The cauliflower were so good it was the right amount of sauce right amount of spice and right amount of crunchness. However, The eggplant was not like what I have imagined when I ordered it was more like a salad with small tomatoes and peppers and celery I did not like it at all. all four pizzas were great my personal favorite was the mushroom one,  the one with the red pepper, The one with the basil, and the one with arugula. The things I didn't Like about this restaurant. First the service was very very slow. We waited for drinks for over 5015 minutes but the server was very nice. He knew that we waited for so long that he brought two drinks to compensate our wait. Second, this restaurant needs outdoor heaters because when we were you were hanging out with friends and talking the food gets cold very quickly especially in San Francisco. Anyway I will definitely take my friends here for celebration or any kind of occasions people hear nice food is great I'll give a four star review.,First time dining here and we shared everything family style: roasted cauliflower and brussel sprouts, beet salad, grilled octopus, squid ink risotto, margherita pizza, and the salumi platter. We each got our own drinks - mix of soda, wine, and cocktails. We enjoyed our dinner here - it was pretty loud inside though and we had to lean in and practically yell to hear one another - our favorite dish was hands down the squid ink risotto. So much flavor and so hearty. What we ordered was a good mix of veggie, starch, and protein and well balanced. At the end we just ordered some ice cream and coffee before closing out the bill. I'd like to come back for lunch next time.,Food service for an event was unorganized. Food that was paid by the host was not brought out. The bartenders were charging $36 for shots of Tequila and then demanding a tip (even though they were getting a tip) it was an awkward moment when it was demanded.,Walnut bread with burrata and mushroom-truffle honey. Get it. Burrata is always amazing, but it was even better paired with a soft and chewy walnut bread, and a honey that's sweet and filled with umami in one. Can't go wrong with the pizzas or pastas here, either. Beretta is the spot for some good food and fun vibes.,Beretta Ratings: 4/5 Food: 4.25/5 - We live very close to Beretta, so I dragged my boyfriend here last night as my treat. I was curious why it's always packed, so wanted to experience it first hand. Beretta is a pretty solid Italian place, and we were both satisfied with our meal, but nothing too outstanding. Please see the description of the items we got below.- Octopus [GET]: My boyfriend is a huge fan of seafood, so we have to get this for him. The octopus is tender, juicy, and moist. It is cooked and grilled beautifully with a hint of acidity from the lemon dressing. The potatoes are roasted just right, a perfect mushy texture. I think the downside was that there was too much olive oil on it, and we weren't a fan of the arugula. Lastly, the portion of this dish is much smaller than expected. - Lasagna Bolognese [GET]: I was never a big fan of lasagna when it comes to Italian food, but this was delicious. The lasagna was cooked perfectly. The Bolognese sauce was fresh and light, yet so flavorful. The fontina, parmesan, and ricotta cheese on topped of it made the lasagna super moist and juicy.  Every bite was phenomenal, and I love the crunch from the edges of the lasagna. The tomato sauce was refreshing too, and definitely did not taste like store bought tomato sauce. I approve of this dish, such a hearty and comfort food. - Funghi Misti [GET]: The pizza was surprisingly tasty. The dough is thin but doughy, yet still crispy. My boyfriend and I both each ate three slices, and we were very satisfied. They were generous with their toppings, lots of mushroom and sausages. Toppings were all fresh and delicious. The fontina valdostana, red onion, and thyme all balance perfectly well with the protein. I am a big fan, and I end up dipping the crust of the pizza in my lasagna sauce too. There's an equal amount of savory and cheesiness from this pizza. I would recommend. Ambiance: 4/5 - Beretta is located on the corner of Grove and Divisadero. The restaurant itself is cute with a full cocktail bar right in front of the entrance. It got a fun and casual vibe, especially during happy hour. Interior is dark, bussing, and always packed, so it can get very loud and chaotic. The outdoor seating arrangement is cute and fantastic with lots of heaters too. This is a great spot for a date night or catching up with a large group of friends. Price: 3.75/5 - The appetizer, octopus was $16, lasagna Bolognese was $20, and the funghi misti pizza was $21, and we added sausage as an additional topping for $4 more. The total came up to be around $80 after tax and tips. Definitely on the more expensive side for three items and portion was just alright, but the food was good and delicious, so that makes up for the price.Service: 4/5 - The host was nice enough to accommodate my request to sit indoor, because it was cold outside. As soon as we got seated, our server brought us water and took our orders. She was sweet and nice and provided some recommendations. The food came out fairly quick; it's just the octopus that took a while and end up being the last thing to came out. BLUF: Beretta is known for their pizza, appetizers, the fun and amazing vibes, and most importantly their burrata cheese. The Lasagna Bolognese was my favorite and perfect, and I definitely recommend it. I want to stop by again for their Happy Hour in the future when my friends visit SF, but not dying to go back anytime soon. The bad thing is prices are on the higher end.,Beretta is one of my latest stops on my tour of the Divisadero dining area. Beretta is an Italian restaurant with thin crust pizza, brunch, and appetizers. I decided to get the calzone today. I love calzones and trying different calzones especially when pizza gets old. Today the calzone had spinach and meatball chunks, as well as hefty cheese. The crust was nice and the presentation was even better(see photos). I couldn't eat the whole calzone so I had leftovers. The calzone was about $24 with tax. Beretta is a nice concept and I would visit again.,LOVE Beretta. I have never been disappointed. You can't go wrong with any of their pizzas. Their apps are smaller portions and a bit on the pricier side, so I usually just go straight for their pizzas.,Absolutely loved this place! Came around 5pm on a Saturday and it was empty, so we got seated right away :) We ordered the bartenders pizza, which has sausage, peppers, burrata and crushed red pepper flakes on a yummy tomato sauce. We also ordered the handmade tortellini which had a ricotta, kale, and a lemon filling with red sauce topped with brown butter. It was fantastic! If you order a pizza, you MUST get the burrata. It's absolutely fresh, creamy, and the perfect cloud consistency. This place was so yummy and I can't wait to come back and try more!,Negative: Our high-top table was sticky and unstable.Positive: Food was very good considering the price and location.,Solid spot to get a couple pizzas and apps. If you're here later on in the evening, they have pretty good drinks. Would recommend if you're out with a group on Divisadero st!,Great food and great ambience. A little too crowded on Friday and sat night. We love to go early dinner.,A solid modern Italian restaurant on Divisadero.I was here on a weeknight to meet a client. First off, parking is terrible around here! We were a bit late after circling for twenty minutes. Anyway, we grabbed a seat outside where the rest of our group was already seated.We ordered some wine and cocktails to start. The SURE THING cocktail was delicious. Nicely balanced and refreshing. We shared two pizzas, with the burrata pizza living up to my high expectations. The fungi pizza was solid. The arancini were excellent. I could have had a whole order myself. The meatballs and the lamb shank were fine. The meatballs needed a bit more seasoning, and the lamb could have been cooked down a bit more. I like a really tender lamb shank. The fritto mixto was also really good. All the seafood came out lightly fried, tender, and not greasy. The service was pretty shaky. Our order was like half right. We didn't even order the meatballs, and our salad and bread never came out. They were perfectly nice about it, adjusting the bill. We had a nice time.,The food was still great but I have to reduce my rating because of the atrocious service we received on my most recent visit. It took almost 20 minutes from sitting down to have anyone even acknowledge us (we had to go ask the host for our server). Once he did arrive, he was completely uninterested and just asked ""you know what you want?""We were also brought a drink and an appetizer that we didn't order. When we said that we didn't order them, we were met with ""are you sure?"" being asked twice. Luckily our server switched midway through the meal and our second server was much better. Food was great, and maybe the first 2 people were having a bad day, but definitely not a good experience.,Beretta is my hidden gem. I've been coming here for years (way before Covid) and cant believe it's taken me so long to write a review. The ambiance, food, and cocktails are all phenomenal. I especially love the bartender pizza and literally every risotto dish. Prior to Covid they had a secret cocktail menu that was a lot of fun- I hope they bring it back. Lastly I love how late they're open. Delicious SF restaurants have a habit of closing early, with Beretta being the only one serving dinner until midnight.,Great Italian place. The drinks were great and the pizzas were . It got a little busy during a Thursday night dinner though. We had a reservation for 7:15pm but weren't able to get seated until 30mins later. That said, the three ppl in my party and I were able to get a sit at the bar and sip on drinks until our table was ready. Aside from that, everything was great and out-of-towners were impressed!,Great pizza, appetizers and cocktails. We tried the walnut bread and burrata, olives and cauliflower. The others in our party thought the cauliflower was the standout but I have a bread tooth -- that's a thing -- and love burrata. Coupled with truffle honey, I was hooked. I had the updated whisky cocktail or whatever it was called and my only regret is I didn't get another. Loved loved loved it. We also got the cherry tomato pizza and the funghi pizza. Both delicious and worth the ridiculous parking dance you always have to do in San Francisco as a visitor. I'll be honest -- my spouse walked a few blocks and dropped me off. The one off note was the super loud old school hip hop. Liked some of it, but too loud. Maybe I'm old. My companions could only take so much. Found this place randomly by deciding we wanted pizza, like now. Worth it.,Went to Beretta for happy hour last week - love that they have a true happy hour with food included! It's a great deal with personal pizzas for only $8, the meatballs were super tasty and not dry, and the cauliflower was also worth getting, especially for $6! The food was all delicious. I would say the cocktails are okay but again, a bang for your buck! Will keep coming back for their awesome happy hour.,Vegetarian friendly. We had a great date night. It was packed on a random Tues night but we had a Yelp reservation so didn't have to wait at all. Our server, Sophia, was amazing and as a fellow vegetarian gave excellent suggestions. She was attentive and kind and really all-around fantastic. My husband and I shared everything. We ordered the focaccia bread, beet salad, and mushroom risotto. Everything was delicious. I only wish our risotto arrived after we were finished with our salad and bread. It was all sort of out one by one within five mins of each other. For dessert, we had the stracciatella gelato, which was good but, but we debated the tiramisu and wished we ordered it instead. We brought our own bottle of wine with $20 corkage, which seemed reasonable since we brought an expensive one along. Overall, delicious food, great service, loud and fun vibe and will definitely be back!,FOOD: Tough choices on the menu because there's so many delicious pizzas, salads, etc. Great sharing portions as well so order a few items. My favorite that alive tried thus far are the Roasted Beet salad and Funghi Misti pizza. Will definitely return to try more dishes!DRINKS: Lots of cocktails to choose from. Can't go wrong with aperol spritz! SERVICE: our server was super sweet. Didn't rush us to order and gave us food recs as well.AMBIANCE: Came here during lunch and it wasn't too crowded. Cute spot for dates, family/friends hangout. Has indoor and outdoor dining, I prefer indoor more. The natural light shines in and illuminates the decor + amazing playlist for background music.,The WALNUT BREAD. Literally would eat this everyday if I could. I've been here a couple times now but this is an absolute must order every time. Beretta also has some really tasty pizzas that are spicy and perfectly crisp. Love coming here for a weekend date night :),Came here on a whim a couple of weeks ago and was able ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
o score a table outside (next to very warm heat lamps) on a busy Friday night without a wait. Since then, I've already been back multiple times because the food and drinks here are just that good.Here's a list of all the items I've ordered so far:Antipasti - walnut bread (4/5): This is a solid appetizer if you like burrata! The mushroom-truffle honey adds a nice touch of flavor. Only thing to note is that it's fairly small and cut into 6 bite sized pieces.Antipasti - saffron arancini (5/5): This was very tasty, and the texture was great as well.Antipasti- herb onion focaccia (3.5/5): This was okay but not memorable/flavorful enough to order again. Salad - kale & romaine caesar (4.5/5): This was delicious, and I'd order it again. Only thing to note is that the salad was more like 80% romaine and 20% kale (not sure if that's usually the case).  Piatti- mushroom risotto (5/5): I normally don't order risottos, but this dish was so flavorful and rich! Piatti - butternut squash cappellacci (5/5): The flavors in this dish are indescribable. The sauce is so good you'd want to lick the bowl clean. Definitely recommend trying! Pizza - margherita burrata (5/5): This is a MUST GET! One of the best burrata pizzas in the city. Pizza - funghi misti (4.5/5): This was very tasty as well, but I still can't stop thinking about the burrata. Pizza - bartenders' pizza without olives (4.5/5): This was another tasty pizza, but I'd still prefer the margherita burrata.Cocktail - fiore (5/5): This is probably the best cocktail I've had in a long time. It tastes light and fruity/citrusy (hibiscus, elderflower, lemon) but also slightly frothy texture (egg white).Dessert - unfortunately, I've always gotten way too stuffed from all the delicious apps, pasta, and pizza to even make room for dessert. Maybe next time!,Great place for brunch. Bright and open with lots of space. Food came super fast and the staff were very friendly. We recommend the octopus salad.,I was in the Alamo square park area and I had a craving for pizza.  Lucky for me Beretta was nearby.  This place serves many Italian dishes that all look great," but for this trip I ordered the """"bartender's"""" pizza and a kale & romaine caesar salad.  They used very fresh crisp produce in the salad and a light caesar dressing.  Nothing to fancy with the salad", but it really hit the spot.  The bartenders pizza was very heavy in the belly, but had great flavor.  The burrata they were using was to die for.They have a nice corner location for this restaurant with fantastic outdoor seating arrangement that has dividers between each table.  The indoor was nice too and they have two gender neutral personal bathrooms.,Loved the fiore drink. Very tasty and not too sweet. The service was very good. The pizza was delicious as well. The restaurant was decorated exquisitely as well. Will be back and definitely recommend.,Awesome brunch spot. Came here with a party of 8 on a Sunday afternoon with reservations, but I think with a party of 2-6 you probably could have been seated within 15 minutes too. I'll definitely be coming back.Food experience: All I have to say is -- Get the prosciutto panini.- Procuitto panini (5/5): Came with seemingly restaurant-made chips and pickeled vegetables. The panini was incredible. The bread was nicely toasted on both sides adding a great crunch, they used a generous layer of prosciutto, and all the ingredients came together wonderfully. Chips were also really good, though not quite as crispy as I would have liked them to be.- Brussels sprouts (4/5): I've had brussels sprouts at a lot of places and I appreciated that these weren't as oily and greasy as they usually are at other places. They also came with bits of bacon, which I thought was a nice addition. They had a nice lemon-y flavor, which was interesting, but could have been a little lighter.- Pizzas (Marg and Bartender's 4/5): crowd pleasers. Both rocked. I tried the bartender's pizza and the sausage was delicious and had a little kick to it. I actually love pizza crust and this had to be one of my favorite pizza crusts (along the edges) I've had this year so far. Perfectly crispy without being so hard that it hurts your mouth to bite it. Only thing is that I think the crust where the toppings were could have been thicker -- my pizza was a bit too floppy for me. - Chopped salad (3/5): Average - Tiramisu (5/5): I love tiramisu and this was fantastic. You could really tell the lady fingers were dipped in coffee as it wasn't dry at all. Environment/Atmosphere: Nice big establishment with cool indoor architecture and high ceilings. Had a nice chill/industrial vibe. Both indoor and outdoor seating. Only qualm was that the chairs were a little uncomfortable. Service: Great service. Standard for a brunch spot. Other: I really like this area of town since other great places such as Che Fico, the Emporium, and Automat are all nearby. There's a lot to do around here if you want to spend a day with friends or go on a fun date!,One of the best dinner experiences I've had in SF! Sam honestly might've been the best waitress I've ever had in my entire life. She was incredibly nice and friendly, and since we were celebrating my friend's birthday, she took such great care of us. The highlight of the meal! The food was stellar as well. We had the walnut bread, octopus, bartenders pizza, hot salami pizza, and lamb shank, and there wasn't anything we didn't like.11/10 vibes and food and we will absolutely be back! And shoutout to Erin for the great music :),3.5 starsThe pros: we really enjoyed the pizzas (happy hour ones were smaller but  we ordered all three for good variety) as well as the lamb shank; the seafood linguini tasted very fresh The cons: it was a bit noisy and difficult to have a conversation, especially for larger group; also the server was a bit on the rude side and not really courteous nor friendly Probably will come back again for the pizza and hopefully the service is better,Good food, good cocktails. The music is tough though. I've been here too many times and the crappy playlist just ruins the mood. I suggest changing it to ANY other Spotify playlist. Ty!!,Came to this place because it's my dogs name,  so had to but it really was a great Italian spot. Good was authentic,  hot,  and delish.  All the food was hand made,  staff was good but our server switched and we had to call him to get something we needed.  Cocktails were fresh,  outside did have heat lamps but inside is more of the experience you'd want.,Beretta you did it again!! I always leave with a tummy full and a big smile on my face cause the food is just top notch. Anytime I have a friend visiting SF, I always bring them here cause it's guaranteed to be good. This is actually my first time dining there though, rather than the normal takeout. (Warning: every time I've ordered takeout, I always wait a while after my pickup time to get the food!) But the dining area was really nice both indoor and out! I do have to say the music was a bit loud for my liking.Food:MARGHERITA BURRATA - this is why I come here!!! The tomato sauce is fantastic and the generous dollops of burrata on each slice is to die forBARTENDER'S PIZZA - wanted another pizza with burrata so went for this one! Not as good as the margherita, but still amazing. The spicy marinara is actually spicy, which was a pleasant surprise cause I wasn't expecting that little kick!SQUID INK RISOTTO: never really order squid items or risotto from restaurants, but was trying to be adventurous. Saw that a lot of people on Yelp have gotten it, and I'm so glad I tried it! Really yummy calamari and the squid ink was a nice savory, and not too fishy flavor.,Ambience: While it was outside, the most distracting part was the wood that kept slamming due to it not being secured down. The interior of the inside did look very clean and modern.Service: Very slow and poor, and it was a Saturday night too. Food: Very mediocre food for the high price. Nothing special or unique about the food. Would not go again for this price.,The food here was unmatched. The tortellini was so cheesy and had a hint of citrus. I also recommend the spicy sausage pizza and focaccia (SO GOOD). 4 stars because of the service - we realize the restaurant was very busy and possibly understaffed, however, our waitress was still lovely and tried her best. Our issue was mostly with the hostess - when we arrived (2.5 hours before closing) she acted like she did not want to seat us at all and would hesitate any time we asked her any Qs. She was very rude and I don't ever complain but our experience with her was very unpleasant. Otherwise the food was super great!,I had had good experiences here in the last and recently ate here again for a wedding reception dinner held in the private room with about 30 people. This was a great space that included it's own bar and bar tender that was super friendly. We got soo much food! It just kept coming, and it was all delicious. My favorites were the salumi with bread and olives, some of the best olives I've had. The other standouts were the meatballs, pizzas, and the tiramisu. I think I had two tiramisu even though I was already full. Great pop-up location with many tables both inside and outside. Also a good happy hour.,Very kind staff. Helped us navigate a question on the bill with patience and a sweet demeanor.,Horrible service. We waited 30 mins after our reservation time - with no apologies - then we're quickly ushered in and out. Food was perfectly fine.,Super good pizza and great service. We just stumbled upon this place while walking around the park and decided to give it a try. I am not from the area so I don't know how other pizza places compare (seems like there were a lot) but was so happy we chose this one.There was quite a wait but I joined the waitlist on Yelp and got a beer across the street, so it wasn't too bad.We got the bartender's pizza and cauliflower.The pizza was just so good, great crust, sauce & fresh toppings. The cauliflower was fried but still felt light and was very satisfying.,We went for a nice little date night a few nights ago and sat at the bar which was open seating. The food itself was good. The tricolore salad and the pizza were both tasty and came out relatively quickly. My boyfriend ordered a Diet Coke and I had a cocktail that both took a while to come, despite us sitting as close as possible to the drinks and there being plenty of people behind the bar pouring themselves drinks and clearly checking out the guests. Which brings me to the downer of the night. The bill. First red flag? Our bartender who was serving us poured himself and some guy who he recognized a drink, not once, but twice during our short dinner. The second red flag was when we asked for the bill and our bartender had a nice hush hush convo with another gentleman who was piecing together our bill. Our bill was all but four items and should've quickly been recalled by any modern pos system. The last thing that tipped me off was that there wasn't an itemized receipt for our bill. It was just the dollar amount and the tip menu. The bartender said that the itemized receipt would be sent to our phone after we pay.... WHAT?! Lo and behold, once we paid and left, the receipt had an extra drink on our tab. Surprise surprise. Much easier not to patron a restaurant than to come in and fight for a $10 refund during a busy dinner service. Watch your bills when you dine here, folks.,terrible service. we made a reservation but they refused to seat us inside (even if we waited for a table opening). honestly not sure what they'd do if  it were raining for reservations since those don't seem to matter. would not recommend.,Loud and fun after work atmosphere with a nice and modern design. I would recommend the improved whisky cocktail and the bartender's pizza. Ask for the pizza to be cooked extra crispy.,Been dying to try this place for a while, and it did not disappoint! Definitely order the burrata appetizer- it was so fresh and delicious. Less crowded than the other location and we walked right in on a Sunday night. We shared a pizza and it was fresh out of the oven. Service wasn't great but it was busy and we had to ask for our bill a couple of times.,We were stoked to snag a two top without reservations, and have been dying to try the vegan pizza. Unfortunately, we were super disappointed. We ordered a pizza with vegan cheese, vegan chorizo, and arugula -- if you're a well-known pizza place offering vegan options, please put thought and care into the ingredients. The cheese tasted like chemicals (maybe make a homemade cashew spread or use miyokos if you're going the store-bought route) and the chorizo was bland. Both were super salty. You don't need to offer vegan options, but if you are, make it count!Also, the waitstaff was not particularly present, which detracted from the experience.A positive is that the focaccia was great! Might be a better place to go if you're an omnivore.,Just as good as the regular Beretta - just a different location! We were able to snag a spot inside, which was nice honestly, because it was freezing and windy outside #soSFI ordered my usuals - the kale caesar and spicy sausage pizza. Super filling and super tasty. I also got the paloma, which was heavy on the tequila, but I'm not complaining :),We were seated outside right away which is a plus. Over all, it was an okay meal. We ordered a beer and it was 1/3 of the way full. The pizza came out quickly but was nothing special and small for the price. The cesar salad was good but nothing out of this world. We started with one server and ended with another which was odd. I dont think i would come back here again.Edit: i made a mistake with how full the beer was. It was more than 1/3 of the way full but not a full cup.,This place is way bigger than it actually looks! We sat indoors by the door which was nice at the time because it was freezing outside BUT it's so loud because the bar is right there haha. The drinks were amazing! And the food was pretty good! Marg pizza: pretty good! Tastes like a regular margherita pizza! Nothing too different about this oneChicken parm: the chicken was super crispy and sauce was so great!!!!Hot salami pizza: it was not bad but some places were cold from the salami on top? Also for me it was tooo much salami. I'm not sure if they put that on after they cook the pizza? But I mean when I took a few home for leftover and microwaved it it was yummy too Dark and stormy drink: very good! Strong but super easy to drink also lolDiablo drink: everyone else ordered this at our table twice haha so it was very delicious!! I do want to come back and try there arancini because that looked so amazing! Also sometimes drinks take kind of long to be delivered so don't mind waiting a bit! But staff and atmosphere was very nice (:,Beretta is a go- to DoorDash order when I'm craving some pasta on the weekend. Their pastas are all unique but I particularly love the corn pasta and pesto. The bread is just ok. I still need to go eat their pasta in person. 8/10,What a cool place! I visited SF recently and dined here with friends. We shared appetizers (Ceaser an Eggplant). YUM! For dinner we shared lasagna and Burrata pizza. I would definitely love the chance to visit again!,Burrata makes everything better. You beretta believe it.Beretta serves up creative Italian bites, hand-crafted pizzas, and craft cocktails. This is their second location in addition to their original Mission spot. It was buzzing but not too busy on a Monday evening. We put our name down for 2 on a Yelp waitlist and arrived 15 min later. Margherita Burrata: 10/10. Crispy crust with the burrata instantly elevating the margherita pizza game. Hot Salami: Delicous flavor and also instantly elevating the pepperoni pizza game with the spicy Italian meats and chili. The crust was not as good as the margherita's.,I've been to Beretta ~5 times (4 at this location, once in the Mission) The food is good, we usually get the Bartender's Pizza, Salad, and Grilled Octopus I'm writing this based on the last experience  on Saturday, 5/21 at 5:30p. We sat insideThey didn't have octopus on the menu anymore, which I understand (seasonal and such) so we got the Mussels instead; mussels were so heavily salted we could barely eat them.The other food was decent (hard to get the pizza and salad wrong); The real reason I'm writing this is because of the ambiance. The music was WAY too loud (it usually isn't), and several other parties at the surrounding tables also noticed. Music being loud is ok if the music is good; idk what playlist they had on," but the title had to be """"Middle school dance aka the most annoying music possible"""". At one point", I actually captured a series of 5 songs which were played:1) Taylor Swift: Never getting back together 2) Soulja Boy: Kiss me through the phone 3) Lincoln Park: In the End4) Tayo Cruz: Break your heart 5) Tinashe: Player It felt like we were in an SNL skit, predicated on playing the worst possible music as loud as possible, juxtaposed by a beautiful, semi-fancy Italian restaurant.Maybe I'm a weirdo, but it ruined the experience. I wanted nice Italian dinner vibes; instead we got weird cruise ship vibes.That is all; thank you,Really great place to go with a group of friends of for happy hour. Tasty cocktails and great menu. A lot of the servers are younger and fun. Has a light and breezy ambiance even for dinner,We love Beretta! Just hosted my fiancé's 30th birthday there last weekend with 35 friends. The experience was awesome and food + wine were INSANE! Loved the buratta toast, mushroom pizza, pollo and LASAGNE! The labrusco was a fun treat as a cocktail, and the Chianti was fair priced and delicious. LJ did a great job leading the team, we loved working with him. And the Chef was super nice to come say hi - he definitely put love into the food. Thank you so much Back of the House + Beretta team! Can't wait to come back soon!,I was excited to try Beretta," but they had a bit of a wait so we decided to go to Beretta Pop Up instead. We were seated outside in the parklet. The tables on the sidewalk had heaters but not the parklet booths themselves. The service itself was """"okay""""", nothing really to write home about. The server came by once to ask if we needed anything but that's about it. Now for the food...Walnut Bread (4/5)... Was actually pretty tasty but very small serving of three little pieces of bread and the mushroom-truffle honey spread on top. Beet Salad (5/5)... We all really liked the Beet salad and the dressing was very tasty and brought the whole salad together nicely. Nice portion of salad as well. Bartender's Pizza (3.5/5)... It was pretty good but it wasn't anything groundbreaking. The crust was fine but nothing to wow you. Spicy Margherita (3.5/5)... Again, the Margherita was serviceable but a Margherita from Tony's or Flour+Water Pizzeria are a bit better in my humble opinion. All in all not a bad place at all, but with the price of the food and 5% surcharge added due to health, medical insurance, and whatever other services, I'd rather go to the other pizza places in SF for the money.,Summary:  Good food with some issues in executionWe had reservations for two people but threw the host a curveball when we arrived as a party of three.  Since it was a Monday night, they were able to accommodate us after a very short wait.  Upon being seated, we had to wait a bit before our server arrived to greet us.  In fact, it looked like there were only two servers working the entire restaurant.  Drink and appetizer orders were placed and again, we waited a longer than expected time to receive our two appetizers (1st) and two drinks (2nd).  Our server did apologize shortly thereafter for the delay as she said they only had one bartender working that night.  While eating our appetizers, we placed our main entree orders.  One of our entrees arrived then we, again, waited a very long time for the other two dishes to arrive.  As the dinner wound down, we ordered two desserts noting that we were celebrating the birthday of a member of our party.  HBD salutations were given by the server though no complimentary dessert was provided or a discount given.Appetizer/Salad:Focaccia-Good tasting with nice garlic toppingCauliflower-Tasty though a bit small in portion sizeRoasted Beet Salad-Could have used a bit more beetsEntrees:Butternut Squash Cappellacci-Good tastingLinguini Frutti di Mare-Good tasting with a bit of heat to itMargherita w/ Vegan Chorizo-Nicely sized, filling, and a must tryDessert:Tiramisu-A bit too runny/soggyStracciatella-Yum!  Chocolate shaving studded ice cream with luscious fudge,Happy hour review - this place is great for happy hour.  If it's nice out the parklet/sidewalk seating is prime too b/c the sun sets onto that area and you can enjoy fresh air, people watching and great deals for happy hour.  Come with a friend of a few and take advantage of the great deals.  I met my friend Leah here and we two pizzas, meatballs and drinks and it was the perfect start to the evening.  By the time we finished up after happy hour there was a big line of folks queued up to dine so happy hour gets you in early before the crowds, you can save some cash to tip your server with and then be on your way.  A great date option or just to get your night started!,Found this gem while pursuing restaurants in the area. Made a rsvp for Monday and tried many things.Walnut bread was delicious! Textures and tastes on point. Meatballs were delicious as was the sauce.Crab rice balls were delicious yet more like a crab cake than rice ball. Caesar was good. Dressing was missing something.Mushroom risotto was fabulous as was the butternut ravioli! I was surprised about the ravioli but hit it out of the park.Got tiramisu to go. Surprisingly really good. I like tiramisu to be more pudding like than cake like as that's how my mom makes it. This was like that but the ladyfingers still had some body. Staff was great.Will be going back! Have to try the pizza!,Had a pleasant meal of mussels, capricciosa pizza, and tiramisu with paired with the Diablo and improved whiskey cocktails. The mussels had a bit more sediment than expected but the sauce was great. Cocktails were solid. Tiramisu was pretty standard.,Made a reservation for Beretta for a weekday and happened to arrive right before happy hour was ending. I got an aperol spritz for myself and shared the fried cauliflower and focaccia with my friends. My drink was a little too strong for my taste but both appetizers were amazing! I especially loved the fried cauliflower. For my main dish, I got the hot salami pizza. It was fairly meat heavy, so I only needed a couple slices before I was full. My one complaint is that there were a lot of little flies inside where my friends and I were sitting. If you do come here, I'd recommend getting seated outside.,I can literally see this place outside my window, so I've been there quite a few times. Fantastic Pizzas. My favorite pasta dish  is the linguini Frutti de mare. The walnut bread is also very memorable. Great drinks as well, but if you want to heaven forbid actually have a conversation,  you may want to go elsewhere. They blast the most god awful top 40 shite , thus making the irritating little Gen Z /Millenial turds surrounding you only speak/scream louder.    Honestly, the service in the place usually isn't the greatest, but tonight we had Chloe and she was fantastic. Literally the best I've had at this restaurant. Very attentive, and present. She was even sympathetic when I complained about the volume of the shit music, despite probably thinking I was just a miserable old fart.,"Try to get there before 6pm on a weekday to take advantage of the Happy Hour pricing.  We got beautiful Negronis for ($6 or $8/per) - and our sweet waitress gave us a """"last call"""" on the happy hour pricing too!A meatball with some bread was $4 - which I really could have made a small meal of.  And the fried cauliflower was also a happy hour special.For a main we split the mushroom pizza - which was excellent", and a kale Caesar salad (lots of fresh shaved Parm).They have a covered parklet for seating, and also some seating next to the building with heat lamps.  You do get asked to leave after 1.5 hours, but totally acceptable during COVID, when they are trying to turn customers to survive.,3.5 stars. We had been meaning to try this place for a while so we ended up here on a date night. We had a reservation but waited probably 30 or so minutes to get seated, along with several other parties who had reservations. I had chicken, my partner had 2 appetizers- the walnut bread and I think the crab arancini. My chicken was ok, a little on the dry side. He liked one of them and the other was so so. Cocktails were good. The music was too loud to have any conversation, there were many children there, and the raised pizza table lacked intimacy for a date night. If you're looking for a casual, loud, more pizza and wine type place, I think this would be a solid pick.  Not great for date night.,Not sure how this place got such a high rating.  Food is just  so so.  There are many many other Italian restaurants in the city that have better quality of food.  If just for the food, I may give a 3-star.  The one star is for the terrible service (it is zero star service!  Hands down one of the worst experience I had).  The manager at the front was super rude.  When you talked to him, he never responded directly to you, instead, he would talk to his staff in Spanish.  And from his facial expression, it was not something nice.  We booked for 9 and they gave us a table for 8.  We asked for an additional chair then the staff told us we can't put the chair there cuz it's blocking the way and offered zero alternative.  From the very beginning, they should have just gave us a table that can fit us all.  I am not sure what is the problem with the manager!!! We then pointed to another table that can fit 10, and the manager said the table was reserved (until we left, we didn't see any party that was larger than us!)  It is totally ridiculous!!!! If you have no table for 9 then don't take the reservation.  I would NEVER come here again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Okay I've never left a review for any place in my life, but Berettas is a MUST VISIT. Sam is a freakin Angel and gifted our table some drinks and dessert to celebrate our friend's birthday. We had amazing conversation and I can honestly say she is the best waitress I have ever had. Erin was also manning the radio station and played Radiohead for the entire dinner which happened to be our friend's favorite band. Sam even brought her over to say hi and we chatted about Radiohead for a few minutes. We got awesome food recommendations as well and everything was amazing. It was all great value and delicious hearty food that is delicious and classy, without being pretentious at all. This was a 6 out of 5 experience and the staff has officially made Beretta my favorite restaurant in SF bar none. Make sure to leave a big tip for the staff. They deserve it ten times over!!,Good food and drinks were goodSERVICE HORRIBLE. we each got our meal separately over 20 minutesDrinks took 30 minutes, also brought out separately. No offense meals weren't that complex, pizza pasta extra. The waitress was ok, but I had to ask to have table cleared and more water. 6 of us need more than a bottle. I def won't be back. Nothing about menu I haven't seen before.,Great location + outdoor seating + musicBrussels sprouts are a 10/10 as was the pizza and beet salad. Good service and overall dining experience Things to skip: walnut bread & cocktails (pricey and leave a lot to be desired),I like this Beretta a lot - the ambiance is way more chill and SFy than the one in the mission. The food and drinks are exactly the same and super delicious - much better vibe and seating at this location!,You know when you buy a new shirt that piece they put in the collar ? I think that's where their pizza recipe comes from...The drinks taste like a bad version of your supermarket brand orange drank (we tried every cocktail).The staff is nice !Oh also you will not hear your friend speaking the music is just reggeaton on repeat at blasting level.,FabulousPeople GoodServiceNeighborhood parked so close guy said he'd watch our car We went to celebrate our son's birthday. He chose the restaurant and we drove from Petaluma to San Francisco.  It will always be memorable because my mom was with us too.Will see you during the holidays!!,Food was great but the experience was ruined by our terrible service. Took 15 minutes to see our server and even then we had to order with the host after asking for help multiple times. Also, My party of 3 was placed at a 2 person high table despite multiple open tables and the fact I was blocking the walkway. When we asked to be moved they said the tables were for parties of 4 despite seeing other parties of 3 sitting at the regular tables. I can understand if there are parties waiting for the tables but both regular tables remained open until we left around closing time.,I loved the Beretta in the Mission district so much that I needed to check out this location. I had almost the same items that I ordered last time like the walnut bread and the prosciutto flat bread pizza. Food was great. I had a cocktail with the chili oil on it and I thought that was okay. I liked the atmosphere, it felt very airy/warehouse-y. In my opinion I think the Beretta in the mission slightly beats this one. But both still great!!!,Very disappointed with our latest pickup order from Beretta. It was a Friday evening so it's likely the kitchen was slammed but the list of issues was quite extraordinary* We got a Kale and Ricotta tortellini which was supposed to be tossed in a brown butter sauce with pine nuts. Instead, we got the pasta in marinara which is a massive downgrade, especially with Beretta's prices* The beets salad had chunks of beets that were practically raw and made the salad pretty inedible* The mushroom pizza had no salt on it whatsoeverI've had a few good meals at Beretta but this total lack of attention especially at their price point is appalling. I'm especially galled that they decided to substitute sauces for the pasta without checking first and then using a far inferior sauce,First off this was my FOURTH time here since the pop-up opened (hoping it's permanent?) and if that doesn't indicate how much I love it I don't know what will We kicked the meal off with the walnut bread and arancini which were delicious appetizers followed by the hot salami pizza and saffron risotto. The risotto had incredible depth in flavor and the pizza (as pictured) was generous in topping proportions, highly appreciated. Try to jump on the yelp wait list since it gets BUSY on the weekends despite how much seating is available. There were plenty of heat lamps to comfortably enjoy outdoor dining as well. We scoped out the menu before being seated so our dishes came out faster than expected, if you hate waiting for your dishes to come out definitely be prepared to order right when you get seated. It made our experience even more enjoyable.,I was so excited to try this place based on reviews and I was a bit let down.The real star was definitely THAT WALNUT BREAD. I mean 5 stars for the walnut bread and burrata it's amazing. But that was the one thing that really stood out for me.The crab arancini was good, it was fine. Exactly what you'd expect from a crab arancini, you could taste the real crab in there, fried nicely and paired with a mild spicy aioli. I think the letdown for me was the pizza and this is a pizza place so that's why I rounded down to 3 stars (I would normally give it 3.5 stars). I got the carbonara pizza and there was just a huge part of it where half the slice didn't have toppings so it was mainly crust. I don't like pizza crust. But I do prefer thin crust pizza. For me this pizza I tried didn't have the right balance because the toppings were too heavy with the cheese and egg. It would have benefitted from some kind of sauce too. I actually usually prefer thin crust, non-marina sauce pizzas so I was so looking forward to this and maybe I set my expectations too high. But I would say I'd come back for that walnut bread if I was in the area. It really was great. And then I'd try a different pizza next time. So if I ever go back I'll update my review then!,Amazing gluten free pizza and great environment for a date, the type of place you can dress up before a night out Or show up in sweats.,tl;dr Very solid Italian restaurant where the focus is shared plates. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. It was a chilly evening, but the heat lamps made the outdoor area quite comfortable.Came in a large group, which was great as it let us try a large portion of their menu. Started the night with the Paloma Nostra, a solid refreshing cocktail. Had a few different appetizers including the Marinated Olives, Eggplant Caponatina and Walnut Toast. Highly recommend the walnut toast. The mushroom and truffle honey was a great mixture of umami and sweet and paired well with creaminess of the burrata. We got one of each of the three salads, Arugula and fennel salad, Kale and romaine Caesar and Roasted beets. The descriptions that they provide are spot on were solid salads. Got the fusilli alla norma and it was probably the most disappointing dish of the night. The ingredients (eggplant, tomato, basil, scamorza) were great, but the pasta lacked flavor and the dish overall felt a bit non-cohesive.Both the Squid ink risotto and Saffron Risotto with oxtail were fantastic and would order both again. Portions are on the smaller side, but the rich flavors made them feel substantial.  Ordered a slew of different pizzas including Margherita Burrata, Funghi Misti, Prosciutto do Parma and Bartenders pizza. They do a solid job with the crust, nice and chewy without being dense. I enjoyed all of them and don't think you can go wrong with any of them. Pro Tip: if you're just grabbing a pizza, take it to Alamo Square, which is just a block away if it's a nice day!,Beretta is one of my favorites and continues to exceed my expectations each time. Went recently on Mother's Day brunch, the food was amazing (3 pizzas, walnut bread, meatballs, Caesar salad), ours drinks were never empty, and the staff went above and beyond. I truly can't say enough good things about Beretta - highly recommend!,Really solid brunch in a city with a lot of options.   Think normal brunch options with an Italian flair, I got the scramble which was perfectly made and yummy," we also tried the budino which was like a breakfast savory bread pudding.  For starters we had the walnut bread which was oozing with delicious burrata.  Service was solid - it does feel very """"temporary"""".  I get that it's a pop up", but it's been in place a while now.  Overall a great brunch experience!,Beretta might just be my new favorite Italian restaurant in town! Love the incredibly creative and flavorful options on the menu!,I booked a table for Saturday lunch. I lived very close to this restaurant but it was my first time here. Great experience!! You have to scan the qrcode on the table for viewing the menu and you can stay for 90 minutes, but it's enought because the service is fast and efficient. My husband and I ordered crab arancini (deliciuos), walnut bread with burrata, honey and truffle (particular flavor, but I liked it), pappardelle with pork sauce (pasta was perfect cooked and pretty good) and a margherita pizza for sharing (it's fine if you want to share it," because other dishes are better). Now I understand why many people come here  at every time in the day.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cafe De Casa,"Delicious chicken Coxinha and corn rissole.We wanted a light snack and they hit the spot! Be aware, the orange sauce is spicy!,Note to self Flan is fun and sweet and half Sandwich with egg cheese half I left the take out at a hair shop in Castro because they don't care It was for later and the niceties of being good Don't get far enough in Brazil too Peace thanks,I think i've found my açaí spot! I've been on the hunt for a while, having tried earthbar, avotoasty, judahlicious etc, and I've not found a click. It's either too sweet, not topped with enough fruits, or comes in a to-go plastic container.Cafe De Casa nails it all, the bowl is in an in-house bowl, it's layered with bananas, and if you add almond butter, it comes as an entire layer atop the acai. Skip the granola to make it be less sugary and experience the taste of the berry itself.Can't wait to try the other options on the menu here. The spot seems sustainable, I hope they can move off the plastic straws and utensils to compostable options soon.,Really cute cafe tucked away in the Castro. I got a coconut bread to go. It was huge, tasted amazing, and did it have some sweetened condesed milk in there?,Service is amazing, the place is very cozy and pretty . I love where it is located, you can sit inside or outside , many stores and restaurants around , unfortunately it is SF and parking is chaotic but it is worth it . I have tried the pão de queijo,açaí ,coxinha , orange juice, a cappuccino and risole and it was amazing , just the empada that surprised me , the dough is different from what I know but overall everything was great.Definitely recommend and will be coming back !,Large, delicious, and refreshing smoothie bowls for a good price! I love toppings so appreciated all the granola and fruit, but if you prefer more smoothie bowl you may want to ask for less granola! The location on Leavenworth has limited indoor seating. Also, the outdoor seating can be a bit difficult due to the slant/hill, but just be careful and it's no problem! The staff is friendly, the food is fast, and you conveniently order at the counter then they serve it to you!,We went here for lunch after a local recommendation and we absolutely loved it! The staff was very friendly, the wait was short, and we were able to get a nice table for 2. The atmosphere of the cafe was lovely - there was a nice mix of friends/families visiting and people working at the tables. We ordered the L'Avela (latte with nutella and hazelnut on the rim - very yummy and not overly sweet), Pão de Queijo (cheese roll), frango acebolado (delicious chicken with onions), and Arroz Nordestino Gratinado com Banana Frita (the beef was perfectly shredded, plantains were cooked beautifully, rice and cheese were excellent - my mom described as the most wonderful comfort food on earth)! We enjoyed every bite of this meal and the servings were big enough to take home leftovers for dinner. We will definitely be back to try even more off the menu the next time we are  in town!,I just stumbled in for a coffee one tired morning as I attended a conference, but a sweet young woman recommended the cheese bread. Then the next day I tried something else and went a total of 4-5 times during the conference. I essentially became a regular because all the food items and coffee I tried were fantastic. I am already planning my next trip and def want to make this my regular hang when I'm in the city. The late with oatmilk, guarana soda, and the cheese bread sandwich with cream cheese  I'm not Brazilian but it tastes like home.,Really cute and quaint coffee shop up the Castro. The Drinks are delicious. I've tried their Lattes, the L'Avela (a hazelnut coffee drink) and their Mocha. Both my girlfriend and I agree that this place has the best Mocha we've had.Their pastries are also delicious and a perfect middle of the day snack.The ambiance is normally very chill and there's always enough room for you to quickly stay or to stay for an extended period of time as well.Will definitely continue visiting this place (and work through the menu of course),This is a chain? I had no idea probably because I don't spend much time at Fisherman's Wharf or in South San Francisco where their other two locations are. I just knew they took over the space where Hearth operated as a coffee hangout in the Castro. I'm no expert on Brazilian cuisine, but I was intrigued by the menu. Most of my experience with Brazilian food involved men who carried spears of meat ready to carve when I flipped my card to the green side.The menu here offered less familiar specialties like yucca puree, shredded dried beef, and picanha (rump cap) as well as items I would have expected like açaí bowls. Given the selection, I played it relatively safe and ordered the $11.95 Salada Tropical, a particularly robust bowl of fresh ingredients: strips of fresh mango, hearts of palm, red onions, cherry tomatoes, and walnuts over a bed of mixed greens (photo: bit.ly/34v36aN). They offered a tropical vinaigrette for dressing.It was a tantalizing treat, quite different from other salads and most definitely worth repeating. It should've been enough for a meal, but alas, I was taken in by the sight of the $4.50 Coconut Bread (Rosca de Coco), basically a sweet roll but especially soft and topped with shredded coconut and a sweetened glaze (photo: bit.ly/3GMbnnx). It was a decadent treat for sure and completely devoured. So now I know Brazilian food doesn't depend on meat on a skewer. I must make it back to Rio someday.FOOD - 4 stars...delightful tropical salad and a sweet coconut bunAMBIANCE - 4 stars...kept Hearth's white-on-white decor, initially crowded but decently spaced and eventually emptied outSERVICE - 3 stars...a bit curt but forgivable TOTAL - 4 stars...flying down to Rio won't be necessary nowRELATED - Exploring the Castro? Here's a collection of places I've visited and reviewed: bit.ly/2HrpFPC,I am a big fan of this location, service was awesome and the place was clean. The food is also really good, make sure to get a coxinha (chicken filled potato ball), they are very similar to an arancini you might find at a Sicilian restaurant.,Been here multiple times and everything I have ordered has been so so good! The coxinha and their guava filled donut/pastry is my forever favorite!,Cute and really good food! Very quick after ordering.Ordered the beef and corn rissole and coxinha.Absolutely loved the rissole it reminded me of Shepards pie. The two were so filling!The place was very cute and had friendly service!,Cafe De Casa has routinely become one of my favorite spots to work on a Friday afternoon. Their pastries are to DIE for especially their cheese bread (pão de Queijo), cheese bread sandwiches, and Coxinha. They also have this Nutella Latte ( L'Avelã) that I get everytime. It tastes like a Ferrero Rocher and I'm in heaven everytime I take a sip and lick the sides. They have a ton of space and outlets for people to  work. They have free WiFi and it doesn't get too crowded so we are always able to get a spot right away.,I come here often.  I haven't had a dish that wasn't good here.  And I think I have high standards. I ordered a salad, awesome: greens, fruits, proteins. I added a steak on top for $6, not a bad deal. On Saturday, they have a special pastry with guava jam, yup. Tried their flan. Man, that was good too. Trying their salmon sandwich now, looks good as well Plus the atmosphere of this place is airy and relaxed. Nicely decorated l, plus flowers and cool Brazilian music playing on the backgroundFinally service has been impeccable. This is my go-to place in the Castro for good lunch, midday espresso, or nice breakfastOne small suggestion I would make for those of us unfamiliar with Brazilian dishes is to add photos of food to their menu. It took me a bit of time to discover their dishes. We, Americans, are lazy. We'd like to visualize our food :),Cafe De Casa is a nice space where you can get a Rich Coffee, and a Warm Pastry. The Savory Hot Pastries were so Yummy for Dinner, I had the Coxinha & the Rissoles (both filled with a gooey cheesy meat mixture). Three pastries for me were a very filling meal. When at the shop, I had also gotten 2 of the Salsicha (filled with cheese, and hot dog) these I microwaved for 60 seconds for Breakfast , and served with a Brown Mustard. The pastries actually reminded me of some of the it croquettes I had years ago when visiting Amsterdam. As for the space, it's light and airy, the staff was very pleasant to deal with, and there is ample seating. Regarding parking it was not bad before 5pm on the side street. With Fall here this is a great option if you want a warm tasty snack or meal to enjoy as you might be wandering the Castro.,Incredible spot offering amazing food options. Get the açaí bowl!. Friendly staff and strong coffee. A gem.,excellent team,the food Delicious home style the best ever for me !  highly recommend,A chill and relaxing spot for a quick bite. Wasn't too busy at all when I arrived and the service was excellent. A couple of folks were there eating and doing work, but for the most part, it was very laid-back vibes, which are always the preference.The latte I had was perfect. The flavor wasn't overpowering, and the egg, avocado, and bacon sandwich hit the spot. I ordered my food without any expectations and left a fan. The meal was great; it wasn't too heavy and just enough to hold me over. The excellent food and good service will keep you coming back. If you don't believe me go and experience the restaurant for yourself. #Delicioso,I love that you can try a bunch of different items for not too much money (by San Francisco standards).  Better than committing to just one menu item for lunch. The coxinha was my favorite, but most everything was very tasty too.Coxinha: My favorite of the items I tried.  A fun shape, like mini pear or oversized fig.  But deep fried with a chewy dough underneath and filled with creamy pulled chicken and some cream cheese.  So rich and so indulgent.Beef & Corn Rissoles: Kinda like a hot pocket, but made with the same chewy dough as seen in the coxinha.  A little bit of ground beef and some corn, though not nearly as packed with filing as the coxinha.Kibe Cheese: Like the Middle Eastern kibbeh, but with a nice creamy cheesy center.  The crunchy meaty exterior had a really nice dried mint aroma to it.Torta De Frango: Like the filling of a chicken empanada, but in a meat pie.  Noticed bits of olive and hard boiled egg.  A slice is really filling and goes a long way.Americano De Salsicha: Reminds me of the hot dog bun you can get in Chinatown, but with some cheese and a thin slice of tomato.  It was decent, but the other pastries were better.Doce de Leite: Kinda like sugar cubes, but flavored like dulce de leche.  Not chewy like caramel.  Not flowing like dulce de leche.  Kinda fudgy.,It's only fair for me to up this rating to 5. This place has become my neighborhood breakfast and lunch spot. Their acai bowls are perfect - amazing texture, filling portion, plentiful toppings. I can't come here without getting a Coxhina - just get one to try and fall in love as I did. Ask for hot sauce - but beware it's SO HOT!!! It's very good hot sauce though.But yeah, I love this place. Please go and support them! My star rating:5  - must go!!! 4 - liked it, give it a try!3  - it was alright2  - I probably won't go back 1  - turnaround and run,Holy wow this place is amazing! I had been trying to go for several weeks now and finally hit it up last weekend. Ambiance on point from the get go! It is a cute, bright cafe with bistro style seating indoors plus a couple of small outdoor tables if you prefer to be outside. We ordered a pao com ovo (breakfast sandwich) and two pao de quiejo - one salmon and cream cheese and one fresh mozzarella, tomato, avocado. They were all great but the salmon and cream cheese was incredible. Seriously, days later, I am still thinking about it. I ordered a doble espresso and boyfriend ordered some sweet espresso drink with hazelnut - I don't like drinks like that but he said he enjoyed it. I can not wait to come back here and try more!,Had seen a recent article or write up referencing this restaurant. I hadn't had Brazilian food before and was curious to try it out.  After reading some reviews I selected the Coxinha and coconut bread. Both were really good !  The Coxinha had a slightly dough based mashed potato consistency with chicken and other spices mixed together - totally yummy !!!  The coconut bread reminded me of a dinner roll, lightly sweetened (sorta like condensed milk) and doughy.  I've been there twice now and plan to go back and try a full entree.  I like the location near the Castro because there are several tables at the corner of Market and Castro where you can get your grub on, work on your tan and people watch :),Doesn't look a lot when you walk past. It was located close to our hotel so why not try something from your own country right?! We were amazingly impressed with how welcoming the people were. Great great food, yummy passion fruit juice Pão da chapa... yes please! There's about a million options of goodies to try out, you can get a little overwhelming, but you really can't go wrong. Not much else to say besides go see for yourself! You won't be disappointed. Muito obrigada !!! Sempre bom encontrar um pedacinho do Brasil onde vamos.,Really good place, ambience is nice, service is great and food amazing, açaí bowls one of the best in the area. They also have something for breakfast, coconut bread is great,We've been coming here for a couple years now. The service is alway great here and the food is fantastic! Must try the açaí!,This little cafe in the Castro has the cutest hanging plants and quaint tables. The food all looked yum, but I just had an almond milk cappuccino and it was perfection! Will be back :),Love the food! Probably the best pao de queijo in SF. I think i tried all of the meat dishes and they're all great. And this is the only place i know that can make passion fruit juice without sugar,All the pastries here are so good! I didn't expect them to be so filling, but they were. If you're ever in the area and are seeking a nice cafe vibe, be sure to check this spot out.,This place had me at Brazilian cheese bread SANDWICHES. No joke, I could probably eat 5 pieces of pao de queijo and have zero regrets. I was excited to try the Castro location, because I've been to the South San Francisco one and loved it! This store is definitely a lot bougier looking, hip, and very ""SF"". We tried the açaí cup ($9), coxhina ($5), and the pao de queijo sandwich with dried beef and mozzarella ($6). The açaí was super refreshing and I liked how they put an extra layer of granola in the middle, so you get it in every bite. The coxhina was like a croquette filled with chicken and cream cheese. Heavenly, but also very heavy! Lastly, I loved the sandwich with the chewy, crispy cheese bread and shredded beef. I haven't had anything like it. I wish I could come here all the time, but it is pretty pricey. I'll be back when I feel like indulging. Can't wait to try their other baked goods including empanadas and pastries. I'll be back to get their frozen cheese bread to take home too!,I discovered this place thanks to an app called Too Good To Waste. This place serves up authentic Brazilian cuisine. I am coming back for the tapioca. So hard to find places that offer it. I tried making it myself, and had watched a few YouTube videos and had even seen them make it on the streets of Brazil- but, i haven't been able to master it. Anyway, with the Too Good to Waste app, you basically get what they give you- usually food that would end up being thrown away.  My mystery bag contained 3 bready pastries- one was filled with ham and cheese, one with a hot dog and the other was a meat filling. They were all absolutely delicious. Again, I can't wait to go back and try their tapioca Brazilian crepes. Parking was surprisingly easy (although, I may be a bad person to ask, as I have great parking karma.,Cute cafe with lovely service! My wife asked to come here for her birthday to get a taste of  home. We ordered some juices and Brazilian pastries to go. While we were outside waiting for our order, the staff came by to inform us that they were out of cashew juice. They were very friendly and apologetic. We ordered the pineapple mint juice instead, and it was delicious!! The food was tasty as well. Pão de queijo is pretty hard to get wrong, but I loved the generous portion. I've heard their coxinha is delicious, but we weren't in the mood for chicken, so we bought some kibe (kibbeh) instead. (If you enjoy Middle Eastern food, the kibe is a must-order, as these Brazilian bites have Lebanese roots!) We had to throw in some Risole de milho as well, because who can say no to a fried croquette with corn and cheese?Would definitely return, especially to experience indoor dining - the ambiance is bright and welcoming, and I wished we'd gotten our food to stay!,Got the L'Avelā which was delicious!! Wonderful and welcoming atmosphere and convenient location.,So glad that they have opened a second location in the Castro which I hit for the first time recently.  Big fan of their pour over coffee and the Peanut Butter Açaí Bowl.  I've been going to the Leavenworth location since winter 2019.  The Castro spot is much larger with the same clean, modern style.,Came here for the coxinha and wow. Why did I not come across this savory pastry sooner?! It's a tear drop filled with shredded chicken, cream cheese with chopped onions and garlic, deep-fried. It's a popular Brazilian street food apparently and it's so good. So comforting. The cafe is small but there's outdoor seating. The cafe is pretty modern and hipster(ish) There's a counter top next to the window for dining and tables at the back of the cafe. There's a variety of coffee, juices, pastries and sandwiches to choose from. I ordered 2 coxinha croquettes and a small acai bowl. The bowl was pricey and came in a standard size plastic cup. It was topped with thinly sliced bananas, strawberries and granola. It was delicious but not worth the $10+. The coxinha were $5 each. Delicious, yes. Comforting, hell yes. Would I order again, Oh hell yes. However, at $5 a piece, it's pretty expensive. The tear drop can fit in your palm and best when eaten freshly fried.Overall, nice ambiance. Chill cafe. Simple and quick service. Food is good but expensive. Be prepared to drop at least $12-20 +tip on 2 items...well..depending on what you buy and how hungry you are. Parking can be a bit challenging. I had to park about 10 minutes away and walk over.  Check them out if you love chicken and cream cheese!,Combo wombo. Coffee with brazilian steak sandwich. What else could you need?Coffee was good 4/5Steak Sandwich (Churasco)  with the hot sauce: 5/5Plantains: 4/5 Dont forget the hot sauce, make or break.+1 for great meat.,I love how cute and clean this cafe is! Service is always great. I got the peanut butter açaí bowl and an iced mocha with oat-milk very tasty! 10/10,Hands down, best espresso / latte in the Castro. It's partly because they stock such excellent coffee, which luckily you can buy by the bag. But the real magic is that the baristas never burn the milk. This is particularly tricky with non-cow milks like almond and oat. Somehow they're able to get it to a lovely froth without going over the temperature cliff into burntville. Snacks and sandwiches are tasty too, including delicious pao de queijo, which is this fantastic Brazilian cheesy bread that happens to be gluten free. They'll even make sandwiches with it. Do you know how hard it is to find good gluten free sandwiches, even in a hippie town like SF?,Delicious pastries!! Great service. Right in the heart of the Castro. We had a great experience here and will be back.,Savory Brazilian pastries are where it's at! I first tried Cafe de Casa at a friend's house, a friend who knows her way around all the good stuff, I assume from the SSF location. I didn't have her expert hand to guide me through the Castro location, so I was on my own, but I throughly enjoyed the five items I blindly bought: -- pāo de queijo: I'm used to the tiny, bite-sized versions from restaurants like fogo de chao & espetus; I was shooketh to see Cafe de Casa's mammoth-sized ones. Holy cheese bread, Batman!-- coxinha: a tear-drop shaped purse of deliciousness. The fried outside encases creamy potatoes, shredded chicken, & a dollop of cream cheese. You won't want to share this! -- americano de presunto: really enjoyed the unexpected sweetness of the pastry but the filling of ham, cheese, & tomato was my least fave of the bunch. -- empada de frango: salty, savory heaven! Shredded chicken, hearts of palm, corn, & olives. -- torta de frango: sightly similar to the empada de frango but the tomato & mozzarella made it less enjoyable than the above mentioned. Doubling up on Coxinha & won't neglect to order the beef-filled pastries tomorrow, I mean, next time I'm here.,Great coffee, perfect hours and amazing customer service.For people like me who need to study after 4 pm it is great location. The design is good as well!,Always delicious food, friendly staff, in a nicely designed interior. Highly recommend the coconut bread, and the rice and beef entree, and you can't go wrong with cheese bread!,Love love love this place and I'm so stoked to see it has opened back up  during the pandemic. We love the Esfirra de Frango. The lunch plates come with so much food. The pastries in the morning (like the Rosca de Coco) are everything and they have really yummy coffee and acai!  Not to mention they always smile and try to make our baby laugh and are just genuinely kind and lovely every time we stop in. Bonus points for having the Pão de Queijo frozen for you to bake at home as well as a delicious hot sauce.,I love this place... but mostly because the hot sauce is so good I could put it on anything.For the business owners--it'd be helpful for customers if you fixed your Square account so it shows your name on transactions. Had to contact Square to figure out the charges from you a month later.,Cafe de Casa is by far my favorite spot in the Castro District (would also say maybe in the whole San Francisco area) to just relax and have a good time while I wait for my food to come to my table. I WFH and sometimes Cafe de Casa is a good option when I need some change on my routine and I decide to work from outside my place. They have an amazing atmosphere, with happy staff helping you, always playing great songs on the background, and the place is super, super nice and chill! It's impressive how tasty their food is (I've been to many Brazilian places before, but they're killing it when it comes to the taste of their food - nothing better for a lunch on a Sunday than their Pão de Queijo (cheesehead) or any of their sandwiches, salads or açaí bowls). I also have to say that they're always super neat and clean! Their bathroom always smells so good when I go there (and that's a must for all of the restaurants - even tho a lot of restaurants in the city don't really care about it).I love this place so much, and will keep going there every time I'm in the mood for a good Brazilian food or to just chill at a nice restaurant while I do some work on my computer.Cheers to the owners and staff! You guys are rocking!,I love the interior of this place. I ordered the coconut bread with mozzarella cheese. I wish the bread had a cheese pull when I bit into it. I want to try the acai next time I come here. My Brazilian friend found this place. She ordered passion fruit juice and she said it wasn't sweet and it was sour but still good. My other friend ordered the bread with coconut shavings on top. My friends and I brought our food to mission Dolores park. The employee was very nice. There are a couple tables you can sit at outside the place. There is no indoor dining.,We had ordered from DoorDash and I wanted to like this place because the food was tasty but I found BLENDED UP PLASTIC IN MY AÇAÍ SMOOTHIE. I thought it might have been just a piece but kept finding more. We ended up straining it to see if I could salvage the drink but there were so many bits in it BEWARE.,Cafe De casa is super cute! So happy to have walked by it while I was staying in the area with some friends. I stopped by twice while in town, once in the afternoon and another in the morning before going into the office. The Latte was great, but the Rosca de Coco was so dang delicious! I couldn't wait until the next morning to drop by and pick up some of it for my colleagues. Soft, sweet, and coconut! I know they're so much more than the pastries and drinks, so I'm looking forward to my next visit. I'll get the opportunity to try some of the other items on their menu. The location is very spacious and inviting. Great space for studying or having meetings. Restrooms are clean and wireless internet works well. Staff are very friendly and willing to make any recommendations.,4.5 STARSOne word: Coxinha.Because I don't wanna put you to sleep this time...Served warm, the tear drop shaped Brazilian croquette ($5) has a crunchy exterior with a deliciously savory filling of creamy shredded chicken and a dab of cream cheese: bit.ly/2wERcJR. If you like it spicy like I do, grab a bottle of their housemade habanero hot sauce from the counter and drizzle it a-l-l over before devouring. I wanted to also try their Crepe (made w/ tapioca flour) but they're not available at this location. Instead, I tried the Pão de Queijo Sandwich ($6) which was fine. I prefer Pão de Queijo with more chew and cheese flavor.  BUT, that Coxinha though.It's hella BOMB with the hot sauce. You're missing out if you don't order it at Café De Casa. The Coxinha is just as great as their original location in SSF...except you now get to enjoy in a spacious, IG-friendly atmosphere versus a shack.,85% authentic Brazilian coffeehouse and pastry shop run by a mostly Brazilian staff. In addition to some truly yummy coffee (smooth, not overly acidic but not bland either, and with a good head of crema), they offer Brazilian specialties like pão de queijo, brigadeiro, cashew juice, and Brazilian style sandwiches. There a few oddities, like the huge pãos de queijo, and a few items that probably wouldn't be offered in a Brazilian coffeehouse, but over all, very authentic. And good.,Café De Casa will forever be the best Brazilian café after it opened its third location; this time it's in the heart of the Castro community.  With it are the team of Brazilian staff, authentic savory pastries, and the unforgettable açaí flavored bowls and smoothies.  When it comes to sustainably sourced from Brazil, açaí will continue to play an important role.  While pitaya (dragon fruit) was second, I have yet to find out if they'll incorporate it in a bowl or smoothie.  After my workout on a treadmill, thought I would have an açaí smoothie to go.  Gotta have servings of açaí to help benefit the rainforest.Customer service will continue to produce same good results.  By the way, the same young woman who knows me was the one from the other Café De Casa of Leavenworth.  Talk about family business.  Well then, looks like I'll be going for an açaí bowl here in Castro, much easier than traveling to the outer North Beach.,The best almond milk latte I've ever had! Stopped in here to kill some time while my car was getting washed and couldn't be more pleasantly surprised. The ambiance is chill, service is friendly and quick, and the drinks are great. The almond milk latte is the creamiest I've ever had and their mugs are tall and narrow so your drink stays hot! The green juice is also perfectly icy, sweet, and refreshing. I'll be back to try the incredible looking pastries,Don't have enough good things to say about Cafe de Casa. It's become our neighborhood spot during the latter half of the pandemic. The staff is so friendly and always welcomes us back. If you are new to Brazilian breakfast foods, make sure to try the savory pastries! They're out of this world!,These are the best people period. The food and coffee is incredible and they always take care of you. The location is absolutely perfect for our neighborhood and the pricing is unmatched. Where else can you get a coffee and breakfast for $10 in the city? Mad love to you guys. -Pilot,Pretty cafes dotted around the Bay. Great pastries and lunches, juices are very fresh and pack a punch.,I was blown away. There were so many unique options that I wanted to try! They were all new to me and thankfully they have a display so you can see what most of the ready-to-eat items are before ordering. The employees there were also super friendly and helpful and patient with us! We finally settled on the famous coxinha ($5) and bolo de cenoura ($4.50?). The Coxinha is a potato tear-drop shaped croquet filled with seasoned shredded chicken and cream cheese. Fried with a crunchy exterior and super soft interior. I was sad that I was splitting this. I wanted it all to myself. It was so delicious. The Bolo de Cenoura is a carrot cake that wasn't on the main menu! It had such a beautiful orange color and we were intrigued by the combination of carrot and chocolate. Although I expected this to be overly sweet, it was not! They give you a HUGE slice and while the sponge didn't particularly taste like carrots, it was delicious and fluffy and definitely not vanilla. The chocolate in the center, which they spoon over the top, gave me pudding-y vibes. We got the last slice. Although the main dishes seemed a bit pricey at a glance, I couldn't stop eyeing the other tables. Everything looked so delicious and generously portioned. I'll definitely be back to try the other food items!Covid: order at the counter (glass display already set up to protect the display items). When we went outdoor dining was still allowed to they served us out items at the table.Food: 5/5Value: 4.5/5Quality/consistency: 5/5Service: 5/5,if the owner/manager of this restaurant is reading the reviews of its customers, might i suggest that you include the ingredients of the items on your menu?! virtually everything your restaurant serves has meat in it...fine, but I'm not a meat-eater, but if i have to study your menu to find out what i might be able to eat only to find there are no ingredients listed, you've failed miserably. furthermore, when i called just now, the person answering was rude because i asked ""what do you have that is meatless"" and then just put the phone down...i know because i could hear the din from the restaurant...and then never answered the phone when I tried to call back...repeatedly. the $50 gift card i got will be re-gifted...i don't have the time nor patience to deal with such a basic request.,What's not to like?  Good looking space. Brazilian coffee and staff!Lots of pastries. Dark roast today. Delicious. Outside seating on a lovely SF afternoon.,Amazing coconut rolls, and the food and service was excellent! The cheese and Gruyère sandwich was amazing, highly recommend!,Really cute cafe close to Castro street with typical Brazilian snacks, finger foods, açaí bowls, natural juices, salads and sandwiches. All very fresh and prepared quickly, with friendly service. Nice ambiance and clean bathrooms. All good!,I stopped by for a Croquette - I ended up getting 2 for lunch. They have sidewalk tables outside.They were good, and I could see myself craving one again in a few months.,Love this place! Food and drink are amazing! My one complaint is they are sooooo slooooooow. My office has taken to ordering online so we don't wait 30 mins for a drink.,I love Brazilian food, the people that work there is so polite, nice and fast. The place is very chic, nicely decorated. The food is great, not the best I ever taste for Brazilian authentic as any Brazilian Bakeries that you can find in Brazil or in some areas of Atlanta e South Flórida. For exemple Their French bread isn't very authentic, is kind of Americanize.  But was very close.,The best coffee I've ever had! Love coming here in the mornings. Wonderful atmosphere. Great team members. So many good treats and eats! A must visit for anyone visiting SF. Very welcoming to the queer community.,I love this place. The pão de quejio sandwiches are the best, along with their smoothies and coffee.,Interesting place to try Brazilian food. Their popular coxinha was delicious. It's like a potato dumpling filled with cream cheese and chicken. Also got their ch",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
colate carrot cake. It's a massive slice and the icing is quite sweet. Would have preferred better quality chocolate. Cake was a bit dry so the icing helped for moisture. Couldn't taste any carrot though; maybe they just use carrot juice? Would love to come back and try some of their other pastries,Proper delicious Brazilian food! You'll find none better in SF - other than their first location! Ordered for delivery and it came quick. A short reheat of the pastries brings them right back to store quality. The pastries are divine and very comforting. Naturally gluten free and so savory - we had pao de queijo and coxinhas. These are very big! If you want small bite sized pao, order the frozen ones to make at home. You should do this anyway because who doesn't want bite sized cheese bread in their freezer stash?The açaí was dark and perfect. Not too sweet at all - it's not supposed to be a dessert you know right? Everywhere else is in SF serves sugar bomb açaí which is not how it's served in Brasil. The juices are also fantastic! Get the maracuja (passion fruit) and be transported to a tropical island,My family and I stayed at Hotel Caza across the street and we got breakfast here 4 days in a row. The breakfast sandwiches, açaí bowls, and coconut bread were delicious! We took advantage of mobile ordering and our food was always ready on time. We can't wait to come back next time we visit.,Thoroughly enjoyed a breakfast take out from this spot! Staff were super friendly and the ambiance - even during Covid - was very minimal chic.We got some of the breakfast sandwiches, Coxinhas (my favorite), and coffees! Breakfast sandwiches were good but the Coxinhas were great - definitely coming back to try more of the menu.,Gorgeous location, lovely staff, beautifully decorated (the plants are thriving) and the space has a light joyous vibe. Missing your beloved Brazil, well come through and enjoy a cozinha, risole (veggie one with corn and cheese is LIFE), have a bowl of acai, or better yet a freshly squeezed orange juice!If you are missing Brazil COME HERE , if you want to practice your Portuguese COME HERE. This place is perfect.,I absolutely love this place. The team (in all locations) is very friendly. Portions are very generous and good price! I wasn't a big fan of coconut, until I tried their coconut brioche. God, this is really good! I also recommend the Salgados, these savory Brazilian pastries filled with a variety of ingredients like ham or chicken. My favorite is the coxinha!,Uhhhh there was a hair in my food??? I still ate it though and it was good but like, check for that shit.,Literally my favorite work/meeting spot ever!! The food is delicious, affordable, and well-plated. The staff are genuinely nice and caring towards their clients, something I wouldn't feel comfortable stating about every coffee shop/restaurant I've been to. But now," the AMBIANCE?! SO GOOD. This location was super well designed. They used visual and auditory cues to bring a little slice of brazil to the Castro in SF and it honestly makes me feel like I'm in Brazil when I'm there. It communicates this """"feel at home"""" vibe that makes sure I stay there for hours while working and eating their delicious treats. Great job!","Everything here is freakin deliciously awesome!!!Get açaí bowls and cheese balls. I get them frozen to to bake myself:))) and their """"creamy Brazilian cream  cheese meals"""" are jaw dropping.",As a Brazilian I always struggle finding good homemade Brazilian food (not the usual steakhouse). The best coxinha I had outside of Brazil was definitely here. The pão de queijo was also great. I recommend all their snacks," juices and açai bowls. The bread of the sandwiches were a bit soggy (could be from the delivery process) but it was great to have taste the """"dried meat"""" outside of home.",Cafe de Casa is my favorite local place to drop in and get a snack or stay around for a while to enjoy lunch. Would definitely recommend the Feijoada, especially if you have an appetite as the portions are very generous.  Every time I go in I have to treat myself to a fresh pão de queijo or a brigadeiro if I want something sweet. The line can get a little busy sometimes during peak hours but it generally moves pretty quickly and speaks to how it has grown to become a staple for most locals.,Delicious foo.Staff members are nice and polite.The only , problem is little bit price. It should not be like. But well, they may know that.,Do not miss your chance to grab a bite from here!! We had a long drive so grabbed some fluffy cheesy bread, a decadent breakfast sandwich with ham & eggs and a refreshing açaí bowl for the trip. Did not disappoint!!!! Highly highly recommend everyone visit. Loved that I didn't have to worry about gluten as their breads are naturally gluten free. For drinks we had a fresh OJ and fresh pineapple juice. I wish I could swim in the pineapple. So sad I don't live in SF only because I miss this place!,Amazing staff, amazing food, and great service. What a wonderful addition to the neighborhood. Try everything on the menu... But the cashew juice and the quioxinha is THE BOMB!,Such a great addition to the neighborhood -- the people who work there are so nice, it's open relatively late, and the pao de queijo...kisses fingers. Honestly, 1/2 of the five stars is just for staying open late alone. Wine's a bit pricey for what you get, but it's such a relief to go there at 3pm and be able to read and write peacefully for a few hours.,Loved their North Beach location when I lived there. And I've been patiently waiting for this location in the Castro to open, and it did not disappoint. The coffee, acai bowl, and pao de queijo were all fantastic and just as good as I remember. This location is also much bigger and they designed it so well; it's gorgeous inside.I'll be a regular for sure!,Nossa!  I was thrilled to see there was a Brazilian spot that opened closer to the Mission.  I was super excited to visit, and even before I walked in, my spirits were elevated with seeing on their window that they serve moqueca--this is the first place in the states outside of NYC where I've seen it, and I knew I'd arrived at a legit place.  The space is bright, clean, and makes me feel like I'm back in Leblon.  I was happy to see that their sandwiches are made with pao do quejo, so all of them are gluten free!  I ordered the shredded beef sandwich and a chicken coxhina.  Their hot sauce is legit, and the sandwich was simple and tasty, and I'm pretty sure the type of cheese on it is catupiry.  This place tapped into some saudade pretty hard, and I definitely want to come back to try all the Brazilian hits--picanha, feijoada, moqueca, and the other fun boteco bites.,While I can't speak to the dine-in energy here, I can stay their lunch plates are divine, and although pricey you get at least 2+ meals out of each, at least for myself! We came during Covid times to try this branch out because we are huge fans of their location in North Beach which doesn't offer Brazilian bbq lunch. I got the Picanha plate and my boyfriend ordered the milanesa and both were very very delicious, but beware it's quite heavy and to me is suitable for dinner. The Picanha was grilled deliciously, smokey yet rich and flavorful and fatty. Every lunch plate comes with half rice half fries, beans, and a salad that had a delicious passion fruit type dressing. I ate this in three portions because I could not stomach that much dense food, but it was worth it! About $20ish per plate plus tax. I also ordered pao de quijo just to try it out but it tasted cold and rather old, not as fresh out the oven and chewy as their North Beach location but it was saggy and mushier.I haven't tried their pastries yet but I am a huge fan of the North Beach location! This one is newer so it is outfitted more modernly.,Today was our third time here - this time for lunch.    The first two times we had their savory and sweet filled pastries - yum!     This time we had full meals - I had a delicious skirt steak sandwich (pincanha sandwich) and my husband had a breaded fish plate (peixe a milanesa).     Will definitely go back - look forward to trying more items :),EXCELLENT coffee for him - single cup pourover ground and brewed right in front of you, the baristas really know what they're doing, lots of choices GREAT hot chocolate for me - Cafe de Casa has, actually, the best hot chocolate in the city (imo).Lovely ambianceConvenient locationReally friendly service,Brazilian pastries galore and perhaps one of the prettiest acai bowls in the city are what you'll find at Cafe de Casa, a sunny Brazilian cafe in the Castro! The base of the açaí bowls here consist of the superfood açaí berry blended with banana, strawberry, and homemade guarana syrup (a plant native to Brazil) and topped off with perfect slices of banana, strawberries, blueberries, goji berries, and granola, made of oats, puffed rice, sunflower seeds, flax seeds, and more! The base of the açaí had a creamy, icey consistency, and the granola and goji berries added a nice crunch--what a delicious, refreshing treat! The pastries also aren't to be missed--I first tried the Empada de Frango, which contained a filling of shredded chicken, olives, hearts of palm, and corn in a flaky puff pastry-like dough. But if there's only one pastry to get from here, it's definitely the Pao de Queijo, a chewy Brazilian cheese bread made with a savory, unctuous dough! You can even get the cheese bread as a sandwich, and I got mine filled with smoked salmon and Brazilian cream cheese, which added even more great flavor to the already delicious pastry! What a nice cafe, where you'll definitely discover something new and delicious!,My favorites are:Rissoles EmpadaCoconut bread with cheeseTHE CARROT CAKE OMFGPao de ovoI'm a pescatarian so I can only vouch for the meatless items, but I can only imagine how delicious those foods are too. You gotta trust me on the carrot cake. The space is beautiful, the Brazilian men are dead sexy, and the food is so so so yummy and obviously made with a lot of thought and love.,I love this place! So glad they seem to be doing well, and that there's finally another well managed cafe in the neighborhood. I love the coxinha pastry, that plus a coffee or juice is the perfect mid afternoon snack if I don't want a full meal. Plus it's super reasonably priced! The carrot cake is indulgent and divine, the passion fruit juice is super delicious. Also it's really nice to be able to order unique a la carte items that aren't all sweets. I enjoyed one of the breakfast sandwiches recently and am looking forward to trying an açaí bowl next time. I'd post a photo but I literally just scarfed this coxinha and juice while typing whoops :),Headed back over to Cafe de Casa for their fejioda. I have to tell you that was some good eating. Stick to your ribs home cooking. The portion is easily enough for two people. They don't skimp on the meat, either. If you've never had Brasil's national dish, you should try it. It's only served on Sundays.,Are you kidding me with those warm and chewy cheese rolls?! I could live on those. And the fresh baked empanadas with the fresh fillings and perfect crust. I had a veggie with cream sauce today but I plan to work my way through the menu. Great service and reasonable prices.  There is an addictive quality to their carrot cake, perhaps related to the decadent fudge sauce.,I am so very happy Cafe De Casa opened their 3rd location here in the Castro! Everyone on the staff is so friendly, the decor is gorgeous, the prices are fair for SF, and most importantly: IT'S DELICIOUS.My 3 favorite things so far are the dark roast coffee (I can drink it black...that's how good it is), the original Açaí bowl, and their french fries! I don't know what they put on the fries, but it's just slightly sweet and it makes them addictive.Obrigada, Cafe De Casa! Eu te amo!!!,I really love Brazilian food. Most people only know Brazilian steakhouses, or churrascarias. If you're not aware of this kind of Brazilian food, do yourself a favor, go to this place and order a coxinha, you won't regret it. The staff was so nice too! I'll return many times.,The most authentic açaí in San Francisco. I just returned from a trip to Brazil where I was having Açaí every day there.  Cafe de Casa makes the real deal!Very lovely setting with a very personable all Brazilian team. The coxinha (chicken & potato pastry) is delicious. Everything is house-made under the supervision of Lucimar.,Wonderful food! The feijoada here is really great! Caio is a great server. Will Be here again for sure!,OMG!! This is a must try!! And return!! Creative, great customer service, different, super clean and of course yumm!! Grab your coffee and sit and watch all the delightful dishes go by to help you decide!,Horrible food  the meat taste burnt outside and no salt or anything..... horrible this is not Brazilian food,Coffee - just right brew-Just right amount of sugar and cream. Alas, it was not hot. Just warm. I guess they don't get many requests for just plain coffee,I'm so sad I moved out of this neighborhood before fully engorging myself at this place. I've had the Coxinha and it is great. Though $5 seems like a bit more than you'd want for just a snack, it is a dense gumdrop of chicken, cheese, and tasty tasty dough crust. It's really quite phenomenal. I'm still in my old neighborhood often enough, so I'll definitely be back.,Staff is friendly and place is clean.Great place for delicious and fast snack. I was there just to pick up online order of little coxinhas, rissoles, esfihas and cheese balls. Everything amazing as usual (not my first order).I do recommend Pao de Queijo (cheese roll),"Very good food but I didn't like the pão de queijão it was dry ... other than that the food was delicious!

Farmhouse Kitchen Thai Cuisine,"The soups are really yummy and decently priced but the specials are outrageously expensive. The ambiance is cute with nice/girly decor and even an area to take photos with a ring light. Service was decent but they put cilantro in the soup even after I asked for it without.,Such a great spot!!!! I love this place and I bring anyone who's visiting here. Their cup noodle dish is SOOO good. Tons of meat though. Their fried chicken dish (forgot the name) but it comes with roti and curry and a small side of blue rice. Super aesthetic! Drinks were also great. Would not suggest the blue one I got (look for the one with a duck in it) but the other ones were great. Their Thai iced tea was also spot on! Parking isn't bad around here, tons of public parking! Make sure you make a resy otherwise you'd have to sit outside or wait a while,They were very niceThe food was expensive.  The food....  Lacked flavor... and they used a lots of sugar Solid meh.,Came for a girls night dinner and it was great! Our first time, so we ordered the Little Lao Table set and it was more than enough food for 4 girls (that have pretty decent appetites). Did not opt for the lobster, but we really didn't think it was worth it. Love that the platter has a little bit of every, perfect for us first timers. Favorites on the platter include panang short ribs, pad thai, and the neua num tok rolls. The papaya salad was good too, but be careful, there is definitely a strong spicy kick! Cocktails were good, my mule was dangerous because you tasted no alcohol in there. I think I enjoyed my friends Paloma a little more. If you're into it, their bathroom is definitely a photo opportunity,I was having a hard time funding a vegan spot and luckily I found this place! As we were seated we were notified about a max limit of 1.5hr. Food- all soo delicious! We ordered the samosas as our appetizer. It came with a delicious yellow curry sauce (vegan friendly) For the main entree we ordered the Pad Kee Mow with vegan meat. Im not vegan but that vegan meat was honestly really good.Drinks- I ordered the permanent vacation (8/10)Location- the location is fun and casual. There is street parking in front of the restaurant which was nice but definitely crowded. I would come again and recommend to others:),I've got mixed feelings about Farmhouse. For one, I'm Thai and I think the flavors are there, but sort of Americanized in a way? Hard to describe, but it was there but at the same time wasn't. Service was good. Let's talk about the food a bit. My gf got the crispy curry noodle soup and I got what is basically a deep fried fish stir fry. Think basil stir fry. I'll take about the soup first. It was good and has a nice kick. They had pickled greens too which is how I used to eat this dish. It was pricey though and I didn't think it warranted 20 dollar price tag. We also got the crispy pork salad (larb). This was a big disappointment. The crispy pork was dry. The sauce was too sweet. I knew I shouldn't have order it haha. So on to my basil stir fry fish. It was good. I liked that they actually put real peppercorn stems. It was good. The blue rice tasted dry, but the price felt way too much for what it was... I did enjoy their food, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to come here.,Thai Farmhouse, let's start with the great things. Service was great. Once we were seated, they gave us a few minutes to decide on what to get. They were also attentive when we were struggling to get a photo and one of the servers took it for us. Upon getting our orders, the food came in ten minutes later (not too bad of a wait). We ordered more food than pictured below. Not pictured are the Hat Yai Fried Chicken, Rib Rice Plate, Calamari, Special appetizer (drunken noodles with mussels). The drunken noodle was really good. It reminded us of Indo Mie's Mi Goreng instant noodle but leveled up in spices. The pad thai tasted like normal pad thai, nothing really exceptional. The khao soi was good! The slab of beef compensated for the price of this meal, and it was also very tender. I probably would like more soup in the khao soi though.Now to improvements... lighting in the private dining area. While we appreciated that we were seated in that area because we have a large party (8), it wasn't too great. The lights were not turned on as pictured, and we had to ask them twice to turn it on. the wait time was understandable given that there were so many people; however, they gave us 30-40 mins wait time but it ended up to be an hour instead. I think it would be ok to say an hour wait rather than underestimating the wait.Overall, it was still a great experience. Great food & great company. Oh, just make sure to expect that this restaurant is on the pricier side. It's great for parties too, they sing for the celebrants :),I came for dinner with a few friends last night before rhe rain started pouring down. Farmhouse Kitchen Thai Cuisine doesn't take same day reservations, so we walked up and were seated almost immediately. When we were sesrching for parking though, there was a small line. Things to know:It's petite inside and tables are close to each other.They don't have a full bar.If you've been to Son & Garden, the decorations are the same, which leads me to believe that both restaurants are owned by the same person(s). We ordered the egg rolls as an appetizer. We didn't have much of an appetite and split yellow curry and thai fried rice. I ordered a thai iced tea. The yellow curry was pretty good - it's what I expected to taste. The thai fried rice was as expected as well, which is good. The egg rolls won me over. They might've been vegetarian but please don't quote me. I love that they asked us if we had any food allergies. I don't, but one of my friends has a seafood allergy and a lot of the food served here has either fish sauce or clam sauce used in the recipe. I've been to the location in Jack London before, and that's the one I prefer based on location and space. It's a lot more spacious inside and being near the water and having outdoor seating on a warm day is enjoyable.,TL;DR: you're here for the experience and expect to pay $$$ for mediocre food. Coming in, you know you're here for the experience and ambiance. It's very well decorated and instagramable. They even have a photo op area decorated with flowers, a light ring, and a neon sign.Once we were sat down, we were told to scan the QR code for the menu. (Tbh, not a fan of this) So I asked for a physical menu. The menu seemed to have 2 different options: the over $40 dinner sets and the ~$20 generic dishes like pad thai. My friends and I opted for the cheaper options which might've been a mistake. I got the spicy chicken noodle soup with the spicy sauce on the side. I also had to fight the server. I originally wanted medium spicy. But he said the soup could only be extra spicy or none at all. Why can't you have it in the middle if you have 2 ends of the spectrum!? I settled for no spice and talked to someone else for the hot sauce. Chicken noodle soup ($22): disappointing. The chicken was bland and over cooked. The soup was just chicken bouillon broth and it tasted a bit soapy (?). And not the cilantro type of soap. I could've gone to a pho shop and gotten a better chicken soup for half the price!! It's like 8 small pieces of chicken, noodle and water. For $22!! I feel like I got robbed. Veggie/tofu noodle soup ($21): just as disappointing but with veggies. The fried tofu bites were very spongy and flavorless, veggies were a bit undercooked, and broth tasted like it came from a can. Save your money, go somewhere else bc if they can't cook a simple dish of chicken noodle soup right, I doubt the pricier dinner sets would be any good.,You should come here for the fun eclectic vibe, beautiful food presentations, and Instagram photos. We made a mistake by coming here for food. And we were disappointed.The menu itself is creative. The food is mid - expect mostly Thai fusion dishes with Western twists. Here is what we ordered:Khao Soi Neau - The heart of Khao Soi is usually the curry broth. However, there was no broth to be found and the dish was dry. Knowing that it would not be authentic, I decided to eat it with an open mind and tried to judge it for what it is. Despite that, I was disappointed by the curry flavor, which was not complex and dominated by coconut milk. The best part of the dish is the beef, which was perfect. Pad Kee Mow - Very oily. The extreme spiciness overpowered all other flavors after a few bites. I know this dish is supposed to be spicy but 99% of Thai restaurants in Thailand and the US allow you to adjust the spice level to accommodate people with varying tolerance levels. Sadly, Farmhouse is the other 1%.Pad Thai with prawns - Good Americanized flavor. Prawns are great. However, the noodles seemed undercooked and were uncomfortably chewy.Crispy Calamari - Loved it. The dipping sauce is outstanding. The sauce seems to be a hybrid between Thai seafood sauce and sweet chilli sauce (much better than marinara!)Chopsticks that come with all their noodle dishes are a big turn-off for me because that is not how Thais eat non-boat noodles. Our server was amazing and attentive. For this price point, I have had much better experiences at many other Thai restaurants.,Such a beautiful restaurant!! I've seen this place all over IG with picture perfect plates and cool innovative dishes. We dined in here on New Years Day, and put our names down for a table with the hostess. We were told it'd be about a 30 min wait, and that we'd get a text once the table was ready. This wasn't that bad, and expected given the line of people we saw, so we just went back to our car to wait. To our surprise, maybe 10 minutes later we were texted that our table was already ready!! We were seated and instructed that the menus were online and accessible via a QR code. We had a hard time getting this open as we were both having weird connection issues, so when our server first came by to ask what we wanted to drink, we'd barely even had the menu up to look. She kindly left us to review the menu and came back later to take our drink orders. Given the massive and all intriguing menu, we were not yet able to make a decision for food, so she had to come back again. We finally decided on the crispy branzino, pad see ew, and was very curious to try the Little Lao set, so we ordered that to-go knowing it'd take a while to prepare. The food came out fairly quickly, but to my surprise the crispy branzino was not what I thought it'd be. I'm a visual eater, so I resonate more with images, and after looking all through the images on Yelp, I thought the crispy branzino was essentially a whole fried fish (split in half) served with rice, mango salad, etc. What I got instead was a whole fish on a metal plate soaking in lettuce and sauce. This was definitely my mistake as the description on the menu clearly explained the dish, so it was my fault for not reading it correctly. It looked huge at first but was actually not that much food at all and I was able to finish it all. I do wish it would've been served with some rice or something (unless I was supposed to order it on the side?), and that it wasn't sitting there soaking in all those sauces as it made the crispy fish so soft and not crispy anymore. The drinks were delicious as well. I got the permanent vacation, which was sooo good!! It was super sweet, creamy, and like a coconut smoothie (you can barely taste any alcohol). My boyfriend, who's not really into sweet drinks/cocktails, found this to be too sweet for his liking, but to me it was perfect! The decorations, ambiance, service and all of that was spectacular. The decor made it all so much more special and beautiful, and it was definitely a place to experience!! While the food was great, it was also pretty expensive (that branzino was $50!) for the portions and I left feeling a little hungry still. Luckily I still had the little Lao set, which traveled very well and there was even hearing instructions on how to warm it up at home as well! I can't wait to come back here and try all the other cool dishes they have to offer!!,Farmhouse Kitchen Thai Cuisine, as gen z would say - mid. The staff was a bit rude and the food was alright. I've definitely had better Thai food elsewhere.My group ordered the Pad See Ew, Pad Thai, and the Hai Yao Fried Chicken to share. Ended up leaving with some leftovers because the portions were a bit generous. The only thing I did love, sadly was their Thai tea.,Farmhouse Thai has sadly gotten more expensive and less tasty :( It's taken its reputation as one of the best Thai places in SF and let it go to its head.While it used to be a great spot for a weeknight dinner or casual hangout with friends, it's become  far too expensive without any commensurate increase in food quantity or quality. We ordered the pad see ew and crab fried rice on our most recent visit - while both came out quickly, there was nothing too special about it and the total came out to over $80. The pad see ew was what you would expect and could get from nearly any other Thai place in the city, and the crab fried rice was bland if anything (and had many many pieces of crab shell still in the rice...).The most egregious example of how Farmhouse has changed is the Pad Thai. Farmhouse Thai used to offer a regular pad Thai- which was somewhere in the ballpark of 20 something dollars; they've now taken it off the weekend menu - forcing customers to order a $60 lobster pad Thai, or no pad Thai at all. Allegedly they let you order an off-menu regular pad Thai on weekdays, but all of it reeks so deeply of greed that it's not that palatable either way in this economy. Seems a bit out of touch to give patrons no choice other than a decadent $60 lobster pad Thai (we tried asking for a regular one too! I'm sure we're not the only people who don't frequently eat lobster).This place has taken a sharp turn from what used to make it great - quality, fairly priced food - to an overpriced and overhyped spot. Sad to see them go this way.,We got the sampler and it was just enough for the 3 of us. I like how you get to try a little bit of everything with the sampler. My favorite was the beef rolls and everything else was decent. I will definitely come back to try their other dishes.,Like many others have said, the food itself is tasty and the interior is gorgeous, but prices are extremely high for what you get. I ordered the herbal rice salad which was pretty don't get me wrong. But if you break it down, it was just a small scoop of rice surrounded by mixed nuts. My friends ordered  noodle dishes including the pad kee mow, and they were average tasting (very oily) and smaller in portion. All of the dishes are easily $20, even for simple classics like pad see ew. I really wanted to like this place but all in all, we left underwhelmed.,The food is quite good. I really really love the 24 hour beef noodle soup, it's delicious. The menu is different from every other Thai place out there. I really do appreciate that.However, prices are through the roof and the menus are inconsistent about prices (online menus are very very wrong). I took some friends here, they had sticker shock and we had to leave.$6 rice is basically insane. The 24 hour beef noodle soup is ~$40.It's also pretty noisy inside. I haven't been able to try outdoor seating though.They have some really good unique dishes though, just overpriced.,After reading the recent reviews I set my expectations very low before coming here. It is a super Instagramy spot, with lots of photo ops around the restaurant. Upon entering, there's a ring light with an area to take photographs. The bathroom has a time limit because that is also a photo op spot with a bathtub and pay phone prop. It's large enough to have multiple stalls, but it's only a single restroom.Here's what we ordered:Panang Neua - it was spicy but delicious. Comes with blue rice. I really enjoyed this one. Pad see you (how it was called on the menu). This was super basic. Would not order this again for this price. Khao soi neua - this was my favorite dish. Crispy fried noodles with a yellow curry. It was so good! I'd come back again just for this dish. Thai iced tea - it had a ball of ice on the top (see pic) which made it incredibly difficult to drink. It was really hard to chip at the ice to get to the drink so I just drank it without any ice. I like my tea super strong anyway. Service was basic, we were a bit rushed because we came in about an hour before they closed. They had let us know ahead of time that we'd have to finish by a certain time so we were expecting this. TL;DR: get the Khao soi neua and panag neua. Skip the basic Thai dishes. Expect extra expensive prices and possibly a long wait for the restroom if you go during busy times. Portions aren't super large.,Out of the dizzying Thai restaurant options out there, Farmhouse Thai is one of the best. The portions, presentation, ambiance, staff, and easy reservation system makes it hard not to love. I got the: khai soi neua (excellent, needed to be spicy though), and the hat yai fried chicken (excellent). For dessert, Thai vacation (tad too sweet). Can't wait to come here again and again.,Second time coming back here, first time bringing ma mom :D. I LOVED this place the first time, service was extremely friendly and informative and I genuinely liked talking to the servers there. It is a very cutesy place with a flower wall/neon sign, and traditional Thai interior accents that remind me of celebrations at Thai temples. Good for casual dinner/groups/and nights out. Our server WUT took great care of us and made some great recommendations for food, I love seafood and spicy so he suggested the volcano noodle dish and this sizzling combo seafood platter (in Thai called pad chu chee talay) not sure abt what they called it on their menu officially  but 1000000p recommend it especially if you like spicy food. 9/10 for that. Last time I got the boat noodles which was pretty authentic (I am from Bangkok n herby-ness/broth/garnishes spot on), and we decided to try the papaya salad w salted crab (som tum poo kem), and their version of namtok beef app. The papaya salad was a bit too salty if you didn't eat it w the lettuce that came with it, especially since I added salted crab to it, and I was def missing some lime juice n palm sugar but was still a pretty solid dish overall 7/10. Namtok beef 8/10 (personal preference since I am not a massive fan of the dish already) my mom ordered it and it was also good and authentic. Finished off with the Thai vacation which is sticky rice and coconut ice cream with peanuts. 1000/10 PLEASE get this dish it is fabulous- decadent but not overwhelmingly heavy and the coconut ice cream is refreshing and reminds me of home. Our server Wut also told me about their spicy noodle challenge which I am VERY interested in trying, apparently Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles) but just way spicier than usual. I will def be back again.,Incredible table for a private dinner party in the back, intimate and cozy, festive and fun.We sampled lots of dishes and cocktails, finishing with a Thai Vacation for dessert. And yes, with the singing, clapping, and drumming.  It was a delight!Colorful touches throughout the restaurant give it a fresh flair. This spot hit all the right notes!,Just when I think this place can't get better, it does! I stopped by for dinner last night and ordered the yellow curry with chicken and sticky rice, and was shocked to see the dish on the table in less than three minutes. My friend ordered the fried rice with chicken and beef, which arrived no more than two minutes later. Yet again, the flavor profiles were out of this world, every bite an absolute treat. I'm disappointed I couldn't save room for dessert, but the rest was just too good to resist!,DEFINITELY HAD A WONDERFUL TIME HERE.Celebrated our friends birthdays, three of them. We were 11 guests in total and seated in front of the entrance by 7pm.At first, we were a little disappointed because our table was not ready yet. But, the host, forgot his name, but did very good after in taking our orders. Food and drinks are perfect! So delightfully delicious and into my liking. Very clean and always, checking on us if we are ok.They cleaned our table first before the singing and cake presentation...so nice and bubbly. Very kind servers and always smiling. Poh, always helpful in our needs.Really appreciate it.It's our third time doing our groups birthday celebration here and this visit was the best. Food is still maintained its quality and the service is pleasant.KHOB KHUN KAH,My table shared the Tom Yum soup to start. It was very flavorful with the added combination seafood and had quite the kick of spice! We also shared the Pineapple Fried Rice and Pad See You. Both dishes are Thai food staples and they hit the spot. The rice is served inside of a pineapple which is always a cute presentation. The décor of this place is what really serves. The bathroom has a shocking bathtub inside that was completely unexpected, but quite the spectacle. Staff was friendly and dressed well. This place is definitely a fun vibe and their cocktails are lots of fun. I'm glad I finally had the chance to check this place out, it's been on my radar for so many years.,Good but not that good. Prices were high here when I first visited years ago but now there is actual sticker shock. $40-$50/entree. Everything is maximalist and invites photo ops (not just the food - there's an actual photo backdrop with ring light) but the decor isn't to the extent of Son & Garden.We had a 30-min wait and wanted to get drinks at the bar while we waited but was told we couldn't. Service was quite *cold* from our wait outside through our entire dinner and we are not sure why. We were pretty low maintenance and not rowdy. Fried chicken was thin and dry but perfectly crisp batter. The branzino was okay, and I normally looove branzino. My favorite was the khao soi neua - beef short rib noodles. We weren't in a huge drinking mood by the time we sat down but one friend got the Gold Fashion and found it too sweet for him but perfect for another. The unwrapped Ferrero rocher was an interesting addition he wasn't sure whether to fish out or what. They did accidentally send an extra drink which we refused, but they never took off the check. Overall felt like food was good but not worth a cold wait outside, the chilly service, and high prices. May have been just an off night but think you may get better experiences at other newer locations.,Food was excellent!!! The shrimp, tangy, sweet, crunchy, rolled in green leaf - superb!! Papaya salad - very good; tangy (spicy!) dressing - we asked for it on side (smart move). I didn't try pad see yu but I heard it was good. The tuna was Fabulous - need extra chips!! Pad Thai was fantastic; lobster was fun but I don't need it, just shrimp and tofu would be perfect.Blue jasmine rice (they infuse the water with purple flowers) was fine - nothing special save for the color.Service was average. Meal was pricy. I look forward to returning, very much.,I really wanted to like this place and have been wanting to try it for awhile now.  Summing up my experience in one word - 'disappointing'.Looking at pictures and reviews on Yelp and their extensive menu, FHT seemed to be worth the expensive prices.  I'm never one to shy away from a pricey meal if the food is good.Upon arriving for our 6:30 PM reservation on a Sunday night, we were seated promptly.We looked through the menu and decided on the par dip spicy tuna appetizer and the lobster pad thai.  For cocktails, we asked the server how many glasses the social butterfly bowl served and he told us 2-3 glasses.  For $44.5, we decided to try it.Our drink and food came out quickly after ordering, which wasn't ideal as we were still enjoying our appetizer at the small table we were at and out came this large lobster dish.The tuna appetizer was really spicy, but flavorful.  The best part of the lobster pad thai were the noodles.  The lobster was overcooked and the meat mushy.  Our shells filled up our plates and our cloth napkins got really dirty, but the servers nearby were oblivious to our dilemma as they were too busy gossiping.  We finally asked for a bowl to empty the shells and was given a plate.Back to the cocktail bowl - it came with teacups and the drink had a lot of ice and some lychee bits.  We were only able to get through about half the bowl as it was really sweet and tasted alcohol-free.  We ended the night with the Thai vacation dessert and that was the highlight of the night.After talking to some other friends who like FHT, I am willing to come back and give this place a second chance.  I just hope the service is better the next time I dine there.,overall food was really good, but wayy overpriced. would only come back again for special occasions - the decor is very instagramable with a flower wall and ring light, nice presentation of dishes, & fun atmospherewe ordered:- khao soi neua ($36.5): this was my fav dish - had very fall apart tender beef short ribs, thai yellow curry, and crispy noodles- panang neua ($47): came w the famous blue rice, which honestly doesn't taste any different. meat was also super tender and yummy- tom yum w chicken ($22): thought this was perfect amt of sourness! it's slightly on the spicy side- papaya salad ($18.95): im not the biggest fan of papaya salad, thought it was pretty standard- basil bomb ($39.95): i enjoyed the seafood, but nothing special - probs wouldn't order again - fishcake spring roll appetizer ($5): servers walked around selling these in a led basket - felt like ur getting bottle service in a club lol,Farmhouse has been on my bucket list for a while. A very hip young vibe inside. Food is classic Thai with many novel shareable plates. The presentation is modern with classic flavors representative of Thailand. The service is also wonderful and efficient. I forgot my ID and they were strict about ensuring that you show it to get a drink, so don't forget the ID!,Beautiful place with amazing service and food. My only reason for 3/5 is due to price and portion and not being good for groups. My friend and I got the Thai fried rice with pork belly and Pad Thai with wagyu, both definitely really tasty but I would've been way more satisfied with a bigger portion for the size paid- rice is $18.95 + $10 for adding pork belly. While the noodles are $19.95 + $8 for adding wagyu. As you can see, it adds up. I'd suggest this place if you're only with one other person and want a nicer Thai restaurant vibe. I do remember the service being sooo nice and attentive. My friend brought his dog and they brought him a treat, which I thought was so nice.,Atmosphere: 5/5Food: 4.5/5Drinks: 5/5Service: 5/5I had such a great time here catching up with a friend. The whole place is decked out in flowers so the ambiance was to die for. I do think the Jack London location is more spacious and the water view is much nicer than this location, but it was still beautiful.Despite it being a Thursday dinner time and not having reservations, they still sat us immediately. We really appreciated that.On to what we ordered:Appetizer:Neua Num Tok Rolls 23 4/5Grilled Snake River Farm Wagyu Beef wrapped with mint, cilantro, cucumberserved with cilantro lime vinaigretteIt tasted like a Vietnamese vermicelli bowl if that makes sense or a banh mi. Very Southeast asian flavors and I loved it. Meat was tender and lean. The portion was very large for an appetizer.Mains: Hat Yai Fried Chicken 35.95 5/5Thai Southern style. Mary's Organic Chicken breast, turmeric & herbs, Friedshallots, roti bread, potato yellow curry for dipping. Blue riceI always get this when I come. It's such a good deep-fried chicken dish and all the sauces are to die for. I wished there was more yellow curry though, because that was definitely the highlight.Whole Lobster Pad Thai 60 4/5Whole live Maine Lobster with tiger prawns, fresh thin rice noodles,cage free egg, bean sprouts, chive, shallot,Peanuts, crispy wontons, and Thai seafood sauceThe pad thai itself was delicious but the lobster was very small. The amount of meat on the lobster did not justify the large price tag. I wouldn't get it again.Desserts:Thai Vacation Dessert 15.9 4/5So good, but I wish they had mangoes on top of it. It was out of season though.Cocktails:Elderflower Spritzer $15.5 5/5Wild Austria Elderflower. Sparkling wine.Thai rose bittersVery refreshing and light. I would get it again. It will not give you a buzz though.Permanent Vacation $16.5 4/5Lofi-Amaro. Carpano Antica. Pineapple. Lime.Coconut cream. Angostura bittersMuch stronger alcoholic beverage. Good for those who likes Mai Thais or Pina Coladas. I personally don't so I didn't love the rum taste that jumped out.General review:The price is a bit high end for thai food, but the decor and ambience makes up for it. Each dish looked so beautiful.The menu is beautiful but really hard to understand. Maybe they should highlight their top dishes or put the entrees at the beginning. For someone who is new to this restaurant, I would have no idea what to order.,I've been to Oakland, Menlo Park and now this SF location. The food is good, my go-to is the short ribs. Can't ever go wrong with that IMO. Out of all the 3 locations, I think Meno Park is my favorite (you just gotta be okay with the train passing by and blowing its whistle). Menlo Park has the better esthetics overall. Although, the tub in the bathroom at SF location with the pink phone and pink flowers was an unexpected and very Instagram worthy touch.Food wise, you can't really go wrong with any of the 3 locations, they all taste good, menu is the same and consistent. I've tried the tom soup, egg rolls, lobster pad Thai (I'd recommend that), the basil bomb dish is also a go to dish. I don't really order drinks or desserts. That's just not my thing. Parking at SF location wasn't too difficult on a Saturday around noon. Don't leave valuables in car. I probably wouldn't go here at night, bc SF scares me at night nowadays.,Delicious food, every time, all the time! Even when we ordered their food via delivery, it was amazing! However, their prices are quite high and you won't get family-sized portions, so put away your American huge portion expectations!I enjoyed their 24 hour beef noodle soup but it's something like $35, so it's worth trying just once. This is a fun place for birthday meals or other celebrations, but I wouldn't say it's my go-to due to the price.,Food (4.5/5): unique delicious thai dishes that are presented very well. The Panang Neua, Hat Yai, and Volcano Cup are my favorites. Spicy options could be a little too much for those not used to spice, but perfect for those that like a little heatService (4.5/5): great service, if you have a reservation it is very quick to get seated, otherwise you may wait 30 min to an hour at peak timesAmbiance (4.5/5): nice decor and they have live performances sometimes. Birthday celebrations are great!,Came here out of proximity and was surprised to see it is Michelin recognized! Was also surprised by the steep prices given the $$ rating... should be closer to $$$ in my opinion. The specials we ordered were beautiful in presentation but just good in taste. The pad see you was standard and way overpriced... If you just want street food there are many cheaper Thai places you can go to instead. But if you are here, the specials could be a good way to go.,The food and the service was great and Inside the restaurant it's nice with colorful cute Thai decorations. but in my opinion the place is a little bit pricey, they charging more money for each protein you choose and most of the dishes are not that big, and the drinks and cocktail we got were good but there was 85% ice Overall nice place,I ordered the Hat Yai Fried Chicken! This dish was sooo tasty that it was addicting  the chicken is perfectly fried and seasoned, it went so well with the Thai styled curry. The blue rice was so pretty and yummy as well! Pretty pricey but so worth the price! You can tell they put so much effort into making such a delicious dish :) They have two locations! One in San Francisco and one in Oakland. I've only been to the San Francisco one and the parking isn't too shabby considering it's in the city. The restaurant itself has a cool thai vibe to it! Highly recommend this place for Thai food!,Finally got around to trying here after numerous recs -- such great food, decor, and service! Everything we got -- yellow curry, Pad Kee Mow, and chicken wing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 -- was solid; all dishes were served super hot and presented beautifully. The servers were also very attentive. I would come back if it weren't so expensive -- for the small portions, I definitely thought it was overpriced, and we ordered the relatively inexpensive items, too. The quality wasn't so good that I would come back here over other neighborhood Thai spots.,Hands down delicious, a bit pricey but you do get what you pay for! We found this place on Yelp and it didn't disappoint. Very Instagram based selection which is even noted in their menu lol. They even have a photo booth and ring light for you to take some beautiful pictures that you can then post onto insta gram. Happy we got to enjoy the delicious dishes I posted below with my friends. Choose a variety, it's all delicious especially with a glass of their Thai ice tea!,Farmhouse kitchen is an influencer's dream, with gorgeous decor (the bathroom is stunning!) and very Instagrammable dishes. Are you paying a premium for the ambiance? Absolutely! But is the food delicious? You bet :) Our party of 5 split the Little Lao Table set and it was the perfect amount of food. At $179 it was not cheap, but we loved that we got to try a little bit of everything. The Panang Neau short rib was probably the star of the show. It was fall off the bone tender and the glaze on it was fantastic. The papaya salad, neua num tok rolls, crispy rolls and spicy eggplant were also amazing. The rest of the items - spring rolls, fried chicken, shrimp fried rice and pad thai were good but nothing to write home about. I would definitely go for a reservation as this place isn't very big, but if you're chronically late like I am take note that they are pretty strict - I had an 8pm rez and they called at 8:03 asking if we were on the way. Also if you love big embarrassing birthday songs this place is definitely for you. I don't think this will be one of my regular spots in SF as there is great food all over the city, but I'd probably recommend it for a special occasion!,We wanted to go to an Italian restaurant nearby, but they couldn't seat 4 of us on a Saturday evening. Out of 4 people only I had visited this Thai restaurant before and loved it. We had to wait about 30 minutes for a spot. Worth it! Gaudy decoration that makes this place memorable. Items ordered: ~2 Hat Yai Fried Chicken: The chicken and blue rice were a little dry. I liked the potato yellow curry (wish there was more) and roti. ~Tom Yum Soup: Spicy yet flavorful. I liked the amount of veggies they put in this dish. ~Khao Soi Neau: The beef was super tender. Everything dipped in the sweet and spicy curry was amazing. ~Classic Thai tea with shaved ice: too creamy and too much ice. I would go for the cocktails or another drink next time. ~Peek a Mule: The ginger beer made it sweet but delicious.,Not only is this restaurant aesthetic, the food is delicious and aesthetic too! I got the Hat Yai Fried Chicken, small Tom Yum, Tod Mun Kung, and Thai Vacation. Everything was delicious and I can't even choose a favorite. However, as a hugeeee dessert lover," the Thai Vacation was AMAZING. Everything about it was just perfect. The coconut ice cream paired perfectly with the sticky rice and the fresh coconut """"meat"""" was delicious.",Such a unique space with Thai dishes I haven't seen before. They have some tv's around the restaurant and they mostly play ads for their restaurant but it's really quirky and funny.Came here with friends so we got to try many of their popular dishes. Started off with of course Papaya Salad. By far the spiciest papaya salad I have ever eaten but it was delicious! Then the main dishes of Run Juan Seafood Sizzling, another spicy dish that was full of different seafood, it was flavorful and delicious as well! Panang Neua, wow the meat was fall off the bone and drenched in the panang curry. Amazing! Kai Yang, Som Tum, half a bbq chicken that was roasted and still juicy. The flavor on it was also delicious! Thankfully not spicy after all the other spicy dishes. Overall, an amazing experience and food! Don't think you can go wrong with anything.,I use to love Farmhouse Kitchen Thai. We celebrated my son's high school graduation party over there. That is why when things opened up after COVID I decided to host our Dec 2022 company party over there. I did not like how cheeky they were in not being honest about what we should order, they made us order a lot more than we needed for the table of 13. Which is fine, we took food home. What has left a really bad taste in my mouth is the way the server was pouring wine. We ordered a bottle of wine and 8 of the 13 people were going to be drinking wine. Instead of making sure that all 8 people got a little wine, the server poured full glasses so that by the time they reached the 5th person, the bottle was empty. We ordered a second bottle and they did exactly the same thing. To me, that shows a lack of customer service and more greed on their part.,Over the past 8ish years I've lived in the Bay, I've eaten here a dozen + times. From the early days where it was easy to get a reservation, cheapish eats and festive service," to the peak impossible to get a rez and a glance at the menu had me saying """"did they raise prices?"""" With their more expensive Thai eats", to now, this local chain with pricy Thai eats. The cycle of life, right here.I'd probably peg this at 3.5 stars. It's incredible pricey and I think you can get just as good Thai food for less. It's however delicious & instgrammable, and they do a good job. It's def less than the high energy service of previous years, they are really just seemingly machine style churning out food. Note to anyone reading this: the side of steamed vegetables wasn't great - def don't order. The spicy eggplant was solid. The spicy tuna tartar app was real spicy, beware! A bit too much spice, as it drowned out the flavor of savory raw tuna. Overall, Farm House is solid. Good for them for still prevailing as a popular spot even with the pricy menu.,I've been here multiple times but fairly disappointed after my last visit. We got multiple dishes of the fried chicken, beef noodle soup, crispy egg rolls, and tried cocktails. The best dish was the crispy egg rolls with good flavor, pretty crispy texture on the outside, and not greasy. The soup was flavorful with a rich broth and meat really tender. The chicken was very very dry and over cooked for all of the chicken dishes. Portion was really small and hidden amongst all the excess batter. My favorite part of that dish is the paratha and yellow curry. Rice was beautiful but dry as well. Over the years it's changed to be more instagram popular with decor and a photo area with props. While this is fun for guests I'd rather have the food be higher quality. The prices have gone up and up and even for SF it feels a bit much.,Saturday, 7/30/2022 - Went to eat at Farmhouse Kitchen in the Bay area. Cute little restaurant. They do have outside seating and inside seating. Address is 710 Florida St, San Francisco, CA 94110. Parking is a little tough here. But, if you have a little patience, you can find one. They do take your credit card down. So if you ghost them, your card can be charged a fee. Upon arrival:Pros:1) hostess was very nice. 2) we had reservations so it didn't take long to get in. 3) restaurant was cutely decorated. 4) table setting was cute. 5) restaurant was clean. Plates, utensils, cups, table, chairs were all clean. 6) water tasted good. No metal or funky taste. 7) server was very nice. 8) they even have a selfie corner with a cute back drop. Yes. We took lots of selfie there. ;)9) all of our food dishes were bomb! Very flavorful. Perfectly seasoned/blend. I wished I could eat more! I love every dish. Their Thai tea was very good. Looked like a snow cone.10) bathroom was decorated so cute!! With flowers, a tub, and old wall phone. Love it! Cons: 1) absolutely no consConclusion:We loved this restaurant. Staffs were very nice and professional. Restaurant was decorated so cute! Foods were superb! Oh my gosh! I plan to go eat here again. I highly recommend it.  But best to make reservations first. They can get quite busy.,Farmhouse Thai is a gorgeous, bustling restaurant that's just as lively and decked out indoors as it is outdoors. The decor is stunning and creative, and this restaurant is as Insta-worthy as it gets in the city. Even the bathrooms are well-decorated! Note that entrees and drinks are pretty pricey, so you're mostly paying for the nice vibes. Pad Thai with Tofu - Absolutely delicious with springy noodles and chewy tofu. You just can't go wrong with this dish. I actually ordered this without peanuts given an allergy and had zero allergic reactions to this dish! I think it could definitely be easy to find another restaurant in the city with cheaper pad thai that's just as good, though. :(Service was incredibly speedy and accommodating. They seemed very well-staffed, and our food came out as quickly as the dishes were cleared and the bill was paid.,Definitely on the pricey side for Thai food! I would say that the plates do stand out and are unique so that's what you are paying for. The service was pretty good too. We came here for my friend's birthday and they were able to sit all twelve of us without a reservation. Everyone loved their food and they even sang happy birthday to my friend with the cake we brought (they charge a cutting fee). I myself was caught by what was a awesome take on a cup of noodles. Good portion of noodles and meat but be prepared for the spicy! The setup of this restaurant is great. They have a fun setup for pictures inside the restrooms and in the dining room (great for groups). Portion sizes are huge.,Really love this spot! It is so much fun to come here with a big squad. The fried chicken was some of my favorite, and they have really fun drinks to accompany every meal. A little bit pricey, but worth it in my opinion because the vibes are immaculate and we left very happy. Would come again anytime and honestly miss being so close to it!,The last time I came here was in 2019 but I feel like the taste went down. We got the hat yai fried chicken but the chicken was pretty bland. Thankfully other elements of the dish were still good. We also got the volcano cup noodles which was a flavor bomb but it's definitely not for those with a weak stomach. I think the spice was too much, coming from someone who loves eating spicy food, because it overpowers the other flavors of the dish. I felt my stomach become warm after we finished dinner. Dessert was the highlight, we ordered Thai Vacation and it was one of the best coconut desserts I've had. Price is on the higher end; I think the only thing worth ordering out of our whole meal was the dessert.,I was really excited to try this spot because the reviews and pictures are amazing! I wouldn't come here back. First of all, I mentioned I had a nut allergy from the beginning to our server. Once we ordered, within 1 minute a papaya salad comes out. Luckily, my friend ate first and mentioned there was nuts in the salad. NOPE - I would have probably gone to the hospital. The food was mediocre. They couldn't adjust the spice level for the ANY of the dishes which I noticed a lot of tables were struggling with handling spice. Luckily, My friends and I can handle spice, so it wasn't a problem for us. My friend had tried this place a while back and she was SHOCKED how small the portions have gotten. We ordered the Papaya Salad, Large Tom Yum soup, Lobster Pad Thai, Hat Yai Fried Chicken, and Pad Kee Mao. Papaya Salad ($18.75): Two pieces of leafy lettuce and around a quarter cup of Papaya on top.Large Tom Yum Soup ($19): Will only serve around 6 small cups of soup.Lobster Pad Thai ($60): The pad thai was better than the overcooked lobster.Hat Yai Fried Chicken (35.95): A small chicken breast, with a bowl of blue rice, a nann, and a curry on the side. The flavor was okay but a half chicken breast...that's sad. Everything was disappointing. The staff were attentive with filling our cups of water. The quality of the food didn't match with the price or the quantity.,Overall, the food was tasty but I did find the dishes to be very salty. For the steep prices, the portion sizes should have been much larger. I've had better Thai food, but by no means does this mean the food was not delicious! I think I was just expecting more from the price and their push to be creative and different. With that being said, I'd say the neua num tok roll starter was my favorite of the meal. Beef was extremely tender and flavorful and the cucumbers gave great texture and mix of flavor. Other dishes ordered: basil bomb and pad ka pow,I visited on a Sunday evening with a few friends. We were seated quickly, and appreciated how the staff found us a spot despite the long list of reservations.Our dishes were very tasty, but the price points were very high given the small portion sizes. The Specials in particular are very expensive, and range in price from $35-$60. We tried a handful of dishes, including the Hat Yai Fried Chicken and the Pad See You. The presentation is very fun, especially the blue rice. My favorite part of the meal was the potato yellow curry served with the Hat Yai Fried Chicken - it was delicious. The bill was quite large given the portion sizes. Our group left hungry. I'd recommend visiting for a special occasion or picking dishes outside of the Specials section, which seem to have the highest price premium.The environment was fun and playful, with colorful decor and plenty of photo spots. They even have a ring light for those who want the perfect shot.,I came here for my birthday dinner on Christmas eve while visiting SF. We didn't have any reservations but they seated us right away. The ambience was good, I like the beautiful flowers hanging on the walls. It makes the whole place instagram worthy. We ordered the Farmhouse wings as our appetizers and it was bomb! I love the pineapple tamarind sauce that comes with it. For our entrees my boyfriend and I shared the Panang Neua and it was the best panang curry we've ever had. The meat was so soft and tender it fall off the bone! We also shared the Thai vacation for dessert and it was amazing. The fresh coconut was my favorite part because fresh coconut are hard to find here. The cocktails are pretty good too! I highly recommend this place when you visit San Francisco! 10/10!,I loved this place before the pandemic and was excited to try it again after 2 years during a trip to the bay this past weekend. Unfortunately, this visit left me extremely disappointed and it will probably be my last time here.My friend and I ordered the 2 soft drinks, 1 Mieng Kum Kung, 1 Hat Yai Fried Chicken, and 1 OMG Eggplant entree. Service was slow, but friendly. The price of everything increased 35-40% since 2019... And portions were small. 3 prawns for $20 and 1 chicken breast for over $36... I was disappointed that the chicken was dry too. Can't believe the bill ended up being over $120 total.Even though we're all dealing with inflation, this place seems to be price gouging at this point. I will not be returning.,Inflation ruined my once-favorite Thai food in the city. This used to my go to spot for good vibe and good food, we ordered takeout several times too. However, Post-pandemic they haven't been the same. Too expensive for the dining experience. Service was unflattering and slow. We were also told we only had 90 mins to eat before we were even seated. - pineapple fried rice: $45. A small sad portion of assorted seafood with soy sauce fried rice. A portion so small it only needed 1/4 of a pineapple shell to hold. Nothing special other than the presentation- Hat Yai fried chicken: $35. A single piece of what looked like a half chicken breast, with a bowl of blue rice, a nann, and a shallow dip of curry on the side. The flavor was great but a half chicken breast at $35 is just unfair. - cocktails were around $18 a pop.We spent over $200 for a table of four, and left the place still feeling hungry.,Great place for a birthday celebration! There was a decent amount of parking. Reservations are recommended because this place gets packed! I love the ambiance-- the decorations, everything! It is a bit dark, but enough lightening to see what you're eating. It's a very unique experience. The food is great, but the portions are a bit small for the price you pay. I love their party trays. You can try a little bit of everything!,Definitely a place to check out if you enjoy Thai food, the atmosphere is great, staff super friendly, food is yummy but definitely on the pricey side. Was my third time here, won't be the last. If you get the Crispy Bronzino, be careful it does have bones!! I had swallowed one while eating, and the server brought over sticky rice to help it down. Trick is to roll the sticky rice into a ball and then swallow it. But the Bronzino was super goood!,Food taste is three stars - green curry has exactly four pieces of prawns WTFValue for price is two stars - huge disappointment Ambiance is three stars, nothing specialParking is four stars, relatively easy$40 for some bizarre sweet tasting chicken is mindless and does not make any sense. Our servers and hostess appeared as if they were doing us a favor by letting us eat at this restaurant.Super disappointing, will never come again. They also include under 4yr old kids as part of rule of 6 to add the 20% gratuity. I guess that is fair but want to share for those who would like to be aware.,I had heard alot about this spot since moving to SF, and it was hyped as one of the best Thai restaurants in the area... Unfortunately I feel that Farmhouse Thai is overhyped (and overpriced)Went here with my girlfriend and two friends who were visiting a few weekends back. Everyone in the group was a fan of Thai food and were pretty excited about the items (notably the crab fried rice). When we got there we were put on a waitlist and only had to wait about 20 minutes before getting a table which wasn't too bad at allAs a group we ordered a few drinks, an order of Samosa's (which they added an extra to let everyone have a piece), The Crab Fried Rice, Pad Kee Mow with a vegan Meat Substitue, Yellow Curry and the Hat Yai Fried Chicken Dish.The drink my girlfriend and I got was called Under The Sea and it was super cuteand tasty (see picture)The food however felt pretty average. It was definitely good but definitely not worth the pricepoints that were set (in my opinion)  , especially for the portions of food that we got.Service overall was great - waiters were extremely friendly, kind and accomodating.Will probably try to swing by here again to get a second opinion, but as of now I'd give Farmhouse thai a 2/5,Really disappointed with Farmhouse Kitchen's new menu. I ordered their fried chicken on their special menu for $35 and it was a pretty bad meal. The food was just plated well but it literally had no taste. Ridiculously priced food. It surely is not a $$ restaurant anymore. I had visited them back in 2016-2017 and it was a different menu which was more affordable and the food tasted good as well thus, decided to try again.,Finally was able to try this place after looking into it for a while! We were able to make a last minute reservation for a group of people (vaccines required and all members of the party have to be present before they seat you). The menu featured a large variety of Thai food options and cocktails. The inside of the restaurant is super aesthetic and Instagram friendly! There is a bunch of flowery decor. I ordered the tom yum soup (which didn't come with noodles). The portion was a bit small but it was super delicious and had that amazing sour shrimp taste! The other dishes with rice have huge portions so I was able to steal some of my sisters food. Taste is forgettable despite its aesthetic. The rice is blue but doesn't taste any different than average rice. Would come back to try other dishes or drink more of the cocktails!,Super aesthetic (peep the corner of the restaurant by the bar with the ring light where you can take the photo with your phone) and relatively easy to get a seat there.My friend and I split a few dishes:1) Par Dip Fresh Tuna - Very tasty and the wonton chip was perfectly crunchy. The ratio was a bit off from chips to tuna but its a great appetizer to share with a small group. Otherwise, you'd have to expand more on this. 2) Pineapple Fried Rice - Your standard pineapple fried rice. It has a beautiful presentation in the half cut pineapple though. Definitely insta-worthy. 3) Papaya Salad - Super fresh, citrusy and spicy. Very refreshing and the heat adds a bit of a kick to the dish.4) Pad Kee Mow - My favorite dish as it was exploding with flavor and I love the flat rice noodles that are used. Farmhouse Thai prices are steeper than normally seen in other reviews; it came out to nearly $70 with tip + tax for 2 people.,Farmhouse came highly recommended by a couple locals who had been to their original Mission location a couple years ago. However, that was before prices were raised. This place is WILD expensive, and I am sorry to say I don't feel it was justified.The food was fabulous though, we had their sharable plate which sampled all kinds of classics. It wasn't enough for 4 though, and had wallets hurting and a snack later on a necessity.Kudos to the fun interiors, friendly waitstaff, and explosive flavors - all so great. If inflation ever goes down I shall return!,Just no. The food was unacceptable for the price and made for one of the worst dining experiences (for which the competition is steep) I've had since moving to the Bay. All these beautiful pictures and good reviews of Farmhouse's food got me wondering if our party just didn't order the right things. Our party got the pad see you and a chicken yellow curry. Curry was watery, bland, and sweet while the pad see you was more sweet than it was any other flavor. We asked for chili to give us some spice to our dishes and the waiter came back with a dish of Sriracha chili paste you can get from the store in the jar (not the bottled hot sauce variety). I understand that the flavor profile of Thai food in America leans more towards sweet than the traditional spicy + sour of authentic Thai food, but this was too much for me. I was expecting a somewhat more authentic experience from such a raved-about establishment. A visit to a run-of-the-mill Thai takeout place would've been far more worth it than what we had here.,Possibly my new favorite thai restaurant in San Francisco. Everyone was dressed in cool Halloween costumes and the food and service were top notch.  Chef Pop grew up in bangkok but was born in loei near the lao border and as a result also does some sharable lao platters.I ordered the Hat Yai southern thai fried chicken which came with yellow curry, blue rice, and a crispy roti. My wife told me hat yai style fried chicken comes topped with fried garlic and shallots and the authenticity did not disappoint. The chicken was tender and crispy and came deboned which made it less messy at a nice dinner. My wife ordered the 24 hour beef which came with a giant bone in beef rib that was fall off the bone tender. The broth was super rich and savory and it had enough beef and noodles for her lunch the next day. For drinks my wife whose coincidentally named Coconut ordered a young coconut which was delicious and far better than even the best bottled brands. I ordered 2 tasty cocktails one with a rubber ducky on top symbolizing the thai protests of the monarchy and one with a gumball eyeball for Halloween. For dessert we had the thai vacation a fresh coconut with blue sticky rice, coconut meat, and vanilla ice cream. Our waiter Wut(thai nickname Wood) who was in a construction worker Halloween costume was on point the whole time and as it turns out hes from the same part of samut prakan as my wife and grew up a few miles away from our house there. We ordered a som tum spicy papaya salad with salted crab and fermented fish to go for later and they hooked us up with a thai tea and extra sticky rice.,Overpriced and not great. Meal for 2 came to $120 and only one of the 3 dishes we had was good.,Came here on a weekend thinking it would be packed but we got seated right away. We ordered the pad see ew and the fried chicken and both were really good! The presentation of the food was beautiful, especially the colored rice which was a fun addition. I also got the Thai vacation dessert, which was coconut icecream and reminded me of my favorite dessert I had in Thailand. Overall was a good experience just slightly overpriced.,This place came recommended by a friend. This spot is serving authentic Thai food, as well as offering delivery. It's one of the most popular Thai places in SF Bay Area. I went to there at that time was quite crowded and very loud. The food itself was good for me. Personally I like my Panang Neua Slow-braised bone-in Short Rib in a Panang curry, Grilled broccolini. The sauce over it was good. Blue rice was interesting. Oyster was fresh. It's such a cute little place! Love the ambiance of this place as well.,I have been DYING to try this restaurant for quite some time and had the perfect occasion to go out.First things first MAKE A RESERVATION!! Its gets packed pretty fast and although we had a super early reservation when they opened at 5, within 15 minutes the place was 75% full!Now the food and drinks: TOTAL MOUTHGASM!!!-Elderflower Spritzer which was light, fresh and you could really taste the rose bitters!-Neua Num Rolls were 1000x better than the simple description which did them no justice at all!-Hat Yai Fried Chicken was KILLER!! A big portion of amazingly flavored crunchy on the outside, juicy on the inside boneless chicken. Fresh, soft roti and some of the best yellow curry Ive had in years!!!-Basil Bomb was insane!!! They cooked the seafood to perfection and if that wasn't enough theres also crispy pork belly!It's the perfect spot for fun groups since theres a cute flowery photo area in the front to get your cutesy pics taken, but also the musics a bit loud and the place seems to draw big party crowds. So if going on a date or something a bit more intimate I would suggest going on the earlier end like we did because after an hour of noise we were really sick having to talk loud across the table not being able to hear each other!,Pricey, but it is so good.We came with a reservation at 12:00 pm on a holiday, and we were seated immediately. The restaurant was pretty much full inside and outside.The menus online on Yelp didn't seem to be the most updated, so we had to browse again. We got the:Panang curry (5/5): This curry was SO good!! It's probably one of my favorite Thai curries I've had. Super rich and flavorful, and came with a good amount of chicken. Solid portion of curry.Sticky rice (5/5): Didn't come with a lot, but texture was great and paired perfectly with the curry.Khao soi neua (4/5): First impressions were that this was a huge portion (which made sense given the price). The beef was super tender, and I loved the crispy noodles mixed with the softer ones on the bottom. I did feel like the curry overshadowed this dish though, but it was still pretty good.Overall, great food and beautiful presentation. We definitely had leftovers since the portions were so big. I'll be back!,I like this place a lot, but so do many other people, and despite the now crazy prices, it's still quite crowded.  Expect to wait even with a reservation.It would be cool if there were a couple more vegan friendly options on the menu.   There are some, but only more basic menu items.,This place is ridiculous. My husband and I had a trip to the Bay Area planned to see a play in Berkeley. Things were just opening up due to covid. I found this restaurant on instagram and was intrigued. We could not get a reservation but the staff on the phone suggested we come early and we would gave a better chance of getting in. We took an Uber and got there right at 5:00. The restaurant is in an area that seems out of the way and somewhat industrial. We were able to get a table inside right away. The interior is extravagant and unexpected. Honestly looks like a dusting nightmare. But it was fun. The menu is large and very creative. The portions are huge.,FoodHat yai fried chicken - Many components to dissect here. The roti and curry were bomb. The curry was rich and sparingly given so that you wish you had more but at the same time avoided being too much. Chicken - could have been seasoned more but that could be the style. The sweet n sour sauce paired nicely with that. It was also aesthetically pleasing to eat it with the blue rice which I believe is just normal rice.There were these fried chips that I believe were for the rice, but I totally missed them. Would be nice for those to be surfaced in the dish.Papaya salad - Crunchy and delicious. The mini shrimp added to the salad were a fantastic addition that surfaced the overall umami (god i sound pretentious). ServiceQuick, helpful, and easy waiters are plentiful at this restaurant. No issues there!AmbianceVery immersive, and even had a cool photo shoot area!,Haven't had this good of Thai food in a really long time. Everything was so flavorful and delicious! The ambiance is adorable and the service is really nice too. I got the Thai iced tea which was delicious. For entrees, I got the Tom yum fried rice and the basil bomb. Both were so flavorful and exceptional. Loved the spice level too. Overall, I'm really happy with my experience here and definitely recommend to anybody looking for amazing quality Thai food.,Came here with friends on Christmas Eve for lunch whose daughter who lives on the East Coast was wanting some good Thai food and we suggested Farmhouse Kitchen as our family had been to their Palo Alto location earlier this year. This location is smaller than the Palo Alto location but just as nice.  Started off with their Chicken Wings and Hat Yai Fried Chicken followed by the Crab Fried Rice, Green Curry (7 out of 10 on the spice level), several individual orders of the Butterfly Pea Flower Jasmine rice which gives it the natural blue color (no - the rice is not dyed in food coloring), Pad See Ew with prawns, Papaya salad and my Permanent Vacation cocktail. We enjoyed everything with our favorites being the Chicken Wings, Pad See Ew and the Roti which came with one of our dishes. Service was great by Kartoon and the others who happen to pass by our party of eight. Now that I have been to both locations, I have a slight preference for the Palo Alto location as the outdoor seating (two areas) is nicer along with the ambiance of the warmer weather in Palo Alto during the daytime.,Their menu is more limited than they one they have on their website.  Choices are not all available.  However, what they have available were very good.  We made reservations but got there early and was seated immediately.  We ordered the pad Thai with prawns.  The flavor of the pad Thai was very good, it wasn't dry or too saucy.  It was just right with enough sauce to cover all the noodles and vegetables.  Lots of flavor.  We also ordered their Kai Sam Ros which is served with blue rice.  When I say blue rice, it is really blue.  This dish had a lot of flavor and very tasty.  Lots of pineapples, so if you don't like pineapples, this dish may not be for you.  The chicken pieces were crunchy and very flavorful.  Only miss was that it had a lot more crunch than chicken in the pieces we had in the dish.  Ordered the flower blossom hot tea.  One order can be enjoyed for additional servings with a couple of hot water refills.  Very good tea for those tea lovers.  All in all food was very good, service was good as well.  Lots of Asians eating at the restaurant which is always a plus when it comes to Asian restaurants.  Parking is on the street, but there's lots of parking available around the restaurant.  Would recommend if you're looking for good Thai food.,Came here for dinner.It looks really nice inside. Get your insta pics ready. They also have a selfie station near the front. Bathroom looks very fancy, with an extravagant bathtub.I got the pad kra pow but also tried the beef noodle and roti. The food is decent. The dishes are nicely presented. Flavor is decent. However, the food comes out at different times for everyone. Also, the food does not come out hot, lukewarm at best. Not worth at these prices.Tried some of the cocktails but they are also quite pricey and taste diluted.It's a nice experience but not the best, imo.,After seeing so many instagram stories and posts on my timeline, I've wanted to go to Farmhouse Kitchen Thai for so long. Upon entry, I understand why. The decor is impeccable. From the flowers adorning the walls, the colorful neon signs, and the trendy music, this place is definitely trendy and hip. The presentation of the food is beautiful, but the flavors were very standard. My boyfriend and I ordered the hat yai fried chicken, pad thai, and a short rib curry noodle dish (don't recall the name). Everything was decent, but nothing really stood out as amazing. The most promising dish was the short rib noodle dish which had a strong curry flavor. The Thai fried chicken didn't really have any Thai inspired flavors. It had a nice crunch but overall was pretty average fried chicken. The prices were pretty steep for Thai food. Our total came out to $100 for 3 dishes. You're paying for the presentation and atmosphere more than anything. I'd come again if friends wanted to go here, but probably wouldn't choose this restaurant otherwise.,Mediocre Thai food. All style no substance.Blue rice is just added food coloring. Nothing special except Instagram wall of plastic flowers.  Quality has gone down hill from pre c19 days. Done with this place Had my last supper tonight . Peace out Farmhouse,I was excited to come here because we love the Oakland (Jack London) location so much and we were in SF wanting to take a visiting relative out for Thai. While the quality and taste of the food is consistent to that of Oakland location, the SF menu is more limited. They don't have a full bar, and don't have several food menu items that Oakland has. I realize how over-priced the place is, particularly for some of their portion sizes; many other reviewers have noted the same. While everything was delicious, I'm glad I tried the pork belly salad this time. I'm surprised that they don't have tom kha soup, only tom yum. I do appreciate that they provide a spoon when ordering the young coconut so you can scrape the coconut flesh out afterwards.,Overall, this restaurant has a wonderful atmosphere and great service! The dishes are also exquisite and creatively plated! However, considering the portion sizes, I do think that the dishes are a bit overpriced. Here's what we ate: **24 Hours Beef Noodle Soup**This is my favorite dish of the night! The beef short rib was well-seasoned, tender, and tasty. This is the perfect dish for cold chilly nights in SF, and to provide relief from the other very spicy (but very delicious so not to be missed) dishes!**Volcano Cup Noodle**This dish is aptly named--after just a couple of bites, you're sure to erupt into tears, sweat and joy. The stir-fried noodles are explosively and addictively spicy and tasty. **Khao Soi Neua**This dish is a star. The crispy fried noodles are dipped in yellow curry and complemented well with lime juice and pickled vegetables.**Hat Yai Fried Chicken**This fried chicken dish comes with sides of roti and blue butterfly pea rice. The fried chicken was delicious but I did think the roti and rice could have been served warmer.,I love this place. Been here a handful of times now and I can honestly say anything you order will be lovely. They also host amazing tea times for small parties where they'll bring out beautiful silverware and decorate the tables a bit extra. Would highly recommend this for anyone trying to throw any nice gatherings.,Food: not great. Fish overcooked. Blue Rice: low quality. Brown rice is good. Portion Size: small. Prices way too much for the quality. Service: not friendly and ignore. They socialize in the corners. Ambiance: noisy but fun,I would describe this place as modern Thai cuisine, with an emphasis on modern. - Hat Yai Fried Chicken (2.5/5): this is supposedly one of the most popular dishes, but it didn't emanate Thai flavors. The chicken was breaded and tasted like it was marinated in buttermilk. The blue rice tasted like plain white rice. The Thai part of the dish was the side of yellow curry sauce and naan. Overall, the dish was underwhelming for its price of $35, and it didn't feel cohesive.- Khao Soi Neua (3/5): this dish was their seasonal special, and the flavors had good harmony. I don't eat beef but decided to still the soup. It's definitely heavy given it has beef fat and coconut milk, but it was rich with umami and indulging. The noodles were cooked well. I would ask for more like to help cut through the richness. - Papaya Salad (3.5/5): this was actually my favorite dish. It tasted authentic, and the veggies were fresh. Medium spice level was a great choice for heat!I'm glad I tried this place, but I don't see myself coming back!,Have come to this place multiple times & have always been impressed by the dishes! Very innovative and flavorful. My favorite is the 24H beef noodle soup, but also a fan of their classic dishes such as pad see eew and pad thai!,I enjoyed eating at this restaurant with a large group of girlfriends. We all shared dishes with each other to try as much of the menu as possible. The Pad Kee Mow and yellow curry dishes were both my favorite. My girlfriend thought her chicken noodle soup could have been more flavorful, and the servers were extremely kind and understanding when she asked for a new dish instead. The dressed up cocktails are symbolic of the San Francisco location, which is highly decorated with flowers, different colored lights, and a swanky bathroom. If it's your birthday the servers will additionally come out and sing. I also recommend the coconut granita dessert if you have a chance.,Walking in, you know this place is gonna a PARTYY. The decor here is very flashy, the dance music was setting the vibe," and you see the bar right when you enter lol. The """"fireworks"""" was also a cool addition haha! Make reservations if you can because this place seems to fill up very quickly!When I first looked up this place", I was excited to try a lot of their menu items since everything was so aesthetic! And the blue rice?? Never heard of that at all. This place is generally much more pricier than your standard Thai restaurant, so just know you're paying for the experience too!We ordered the Hat Yei Fried Chicken, Khao Soy, Calamari, and an Thai Iced Tea. The presentation was really pretty and instagrammable. Digging into the fried chicken dish, it also comes with roti. Though, the roti was a bit too hard and crispy, we wish it was softer and fluffier. The fried chicken itself had a nice crisp to it. The sauce also complements it very well, but was a bit too sweet for the chicken. The blue rice looks cool, but it's just rice LOL.The khao soy was pretty good! The beef was very soft and tender, I enjoyed this one the most. My bf added the whole spicy sauce though, so it got really spicy for me haha. Calamari was good! Portion size was kind of small, but the crispy and chewiness was great.The Thai iced tea looks cool, but it's not so much practical because the huge ball of ice gets in the way to drink it. The tea is concentrated without the ball of ice, so you'd have to wait a bit so the ice could melt in there. I made the mistake of stabbing the ice ball too much that my drink got really diluted lol.,I love farmhouse thai! I always bring friends or family when they're in town. I've been to both their SF and Menlo Park locations. It's such an eclectic and vibrant atmosphere once you're inside. Definitely an IG/TikTok worthy spot. The service is fantastic and the food is amazing! My go to is the Panang Neau - this is a MUST. It's a fall off the bone braised short rib over blue rice with panang curry. It's absolutely divine and I'm drooling just thinking about it. All of their portions are pretty big so I would definitely bring friends and try a bunch of dishes.,"Great service. Great food. Sat at the bar with Wut! Can I get a """"wut wut"""" just for him?! He was very attentive and helpful. Made yummy drinks and had great attitude. Now food...beef rib with panang curry-mind BLOWN. So tender", it was falling off the bone. Served with blue rice and veggies. Had the filet rolls and hot yay chicken too, but the star was that rib man. Pics of the receipt and our cocktail below. A little on the pricier side, but worth the good food and service in my opinion. Too bad they don't have one in SoCal where I live! Thanks for a great first night meal, Farmhouse!,Came based on reviews and few recommendations from friends. Inside is really cute, great ambience and vibe but food was definitely just okay. Not your traditional Thai restaurant (no green curry, no chicken pad thai only with lobster). They had a special with slow cooked beef ribs and noodles which was really good. Otherwise other items like the yellow curry and pad see you were average. Also very expensive for the taste and how much you get. Not a bad place to try once but wouldn't highly recommend,The ambiance felt like I was in Thailand all over again! The food is spectacular and I have a preference for perfectly spiced foods and this restaurant provided me the perfect spice level. They have tuk tuks and birthday celebrations that were very vibrant & lively. The pad Thai and Pad Kee Mao were well made especially for vegetarians. Would highly recommend.The service was a little slowly though since it was quite busy.,After seeing the reviews and hype I thought I would try this restaurant.   I love Thai food and wanted see for myself.  In short it was just ok and  for the most part  barely warm. But sadly it doesn't live up to my expectations.   We had the fried chicken with yellow curry.  It was kind of tasteless.   The curry sauce was very mediocre,  the chicken was crispy but bland.  I wouldn't have it again.  Then we tried the short rib beef in Penang curry... It was fairly tasty but kind of tough,   tougher than it should have been and quite expensive.   We had the basil chicken which was ok,  but not awesome.   The best examples usually also come with ground chicken but this was bigger pieces.   Tasty and not bad,   not great.   We had the Tom yum soup,  it was quite tasty,  but spicy.   But quite good.   They put a small candle or flame under it but it didn't last long and before it was stone cold. Actually that's a problem with most of the dishes here.  They all came out barely warm and cooked super quick.   This might be helped by being served on colorful but metal dishes.   They get ice cold super fast.I wouldn't go back here.   There are better Thai restaurants around,  most would be cheaper too.,I wouldn't say that this tastes like authentic thai food but the food quality is amazing. Definitely would consider it as upscale asian food. The chicken was cooked to perfection, very juicy. The basil bomb was a bit spicy but it was really good. It had a very potent garlic and basil taste that I like. The eggplants were very flavorful, it goes so well with rice. The pad kee mow spice doesnt hit you until after eating it, this one was alright, it just tasted like a regular stir fry to me. There were so much beef in the khao soi, so good. The green curry was also very delicious and vegetarian friendly.,Food was good, the roti curry was delicious but it's an expensive place and despite spending $30 per person on just food, we left still feeling hungry,Unfortunately this place, for me, was mostly for instagram and not actually enjoyable. Good, fast, friendly service though. The food was ok, mainly the fried chicken. The volcano noodles were so salty as to be inedible after the first few bites. But were you to enjoy them, you'd be disappointed because the cup is full of cabbage. It tricks you into thinking you get the full cup. Way over priced. And the two cocktails we got were both pretty bad. Everything is very aesthetic/quirky and the staff are fast/nice. Apart from that, this was a let down. I likely won't be back but I'd say it's still worth a try if you haven't been.,Good food, but I thought it was a bit overpriced for something not super mind blowing. They definitely had unique dishes and everything was solid. I got the Thai fried chicken, and it came with some cool looking blue rice and a curry. I don't think I would actively recommend it, but at the same time I'd definitely be down to go again if someone else suggested it/wanted to try it. It's worth checking out - I know some friends who really love it here!,Foods were superb! We ordered the rib and the lobster pad Thai and both tasted amazing. The Wagyu beef was cooked perfectly!! We shared the King Crab fried rice and finished the meal off with the chocolate lava cake. The service was perfect and you cannot beat the beautiful attention to detail here. I highly recommend it.,good ambience good food limited vegetarian menu . we have heard so much about the restaurant have been wanted to try fromlong time and it didn't disappoint. Though the weekend veg menu options were limited whatever we ordered was delicious. especially the Thai curry and coconut cream latte!!!!,My friend suggested we come here since it's a favorite of hers and it was surely very tasty! We shared cocktails, a salad, a basil dish, and a ice cream bread dessert. All were excellent. It was the most memorable restaurant out of my week long trip to SF! I also loved how the staff would make customers with birthdays feel special by coming out," singing and dancing in a parade. It was a fun atmosphere.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alnico,"You know those brunch places with a whole line out the door on Saturdays that make you think ""I NEED to go there"", but after that, your only relationship with the restaurant is that when someone else brings it up you contribute by exclaiming ""oh I've been meaning to go since FOREVER"" to great feedback & lots of nods? Alnico SF was one of those places for me. A friend made a group brunch reservation and invited me one such Saturday and unknowingly turned my dreams into reality, shout-out to them. The ambiance is nice and light and lively with chatter. Service was really quick despite the volume of patrons. And the staff was friendly and accommodating. The sweet dishes - the ube hotcake and one of the waffle sides ( with sesame seed butter, I think?) were highlights, so definitely don't miss them! Not too sweet at all. I ordered the vegan kaldereta (which I thought was tofu & vegetables with a side of rice, but I now know is mostly a rice dish) and enjoyed it. The portion sizes are generous. Would recommend getting the Ube Hotcake to share (comfortable to share among 2-3 people) and then one entrée per person. You could probably get away with ordering n-1 entrees for n people, too.,Came here for Saturday brunch and made a reservation for 11am. Ended up getting seated at 11:10 and the place started getting really packed by noon. Would definitely recommend either making a reservation beforehand or coming by 11am to get a seat. We ordered the ube hot cakes as it seemed to be the most signature dish, chicken porridge and chicken and waffles. The portion sizes were absolutely huge. All the dishes were really tasty and definitely a really unique blend of flavors (perfect mix of asian fusion). Ube hotcakes weren't too sweet and the ube flavor in the sauce was really good with the pancakes. The portion size was absolutely huge and could be shared with 2-3 people. Chicken porridge was really tasty and would definitely recommend. The chicken and waffles were alright. The Korean fried chicken addition made it interesting and created Asian fusion but the overall dish was just okay in flavor.,Overall, I had a pretty nice experience here! Definitely plan to get here earlier or expect to wait an hour before being seated because it get's quite busy. Overall, Alnico is a good place if it's your first time trying Filipino food, as the flavors are more mild but a great introduction to the tastes. There were also indoor and outdoor seating options and a decent amount of street parking Ube Hotcakes: The ube flavor is not super strong but still there. A little bit on the dry side if you eat it without the sauce.Pork Belly: Really yummy! Especially with the vinegar on the side. The mac salad on the side is a bit on the heavier side and more mayo forward.Niloco Mo Ako: The flavor was good but could've been stronger and the short ribs were decent quality. However, the garlic rice and egg really complimented it.Ube Horchata: Really good and not too sweet! Also a more mild ube flavorUbe Viet Coffee: The Vietnamese coffee is really strong and the ube foam compliments it well. If you're not a big fan of strong coffee drinks, I'd recommend maybe getting it with more ube if possibleCalamansi Mint Refresher: Sour and refreshing! I personally and not a fan of sour drinks, but my friend who ordered it really enjoyed itIced Tea: Simple and sweet,Filipino fusion SF brunch favorite in Mission! Would recommend grabbing reservations ahead of time, but def not impossible to walk in and grab a tableUbe hotcakes (5/5): MUST TRY! have been to Alnico a few times and this is my go to order!! the fluffy pancakes are surrounded in the most delicious and vibrant purple coconut ube sauce - super instagrammable! would recommend the mini size, as it's more than enough to feed 2 peoplePoached chicken porridge (5/5): i wasn't a big congee fan, but this was so flavorful and heartwarming. the porridge had the perfect consistency and umami flavors. it came with lots of tender chicken, crunchy garlic bits, black chili oil, and jammy eggChicken & waffles (3.5/5): was super excited for korean fried chicken and the black sesame butter ontop of the waffles, but was a lil underwhelmed. loved the soy garlicky sauce, but chicken wings itself was dry and the waffles were soggy. the black sesame butter was a nice twist tho!Pork belly (3.5/5): dipping the porkbelly pieces in spicy vinegar sauce was tasty, but pretty standard. the rest of the dish was bland and just okay - came with lots of rice, macaroni salad, and a gigantic strawberryOmelet (4/5): wish the omelet was less dry and more fluffy, but loved how they did not skimp out on the crab meat!! the gochujang mayo sauce drizzled ontop was so yummy, and literally was topped with a huge tornado of arugula lolUbe horchata (4/5): thought it tasted like a regular horchata with very little coconut ube flavor :( it's super pretty tho I'll definitely be back for the ube hotcakes and poached chicken!!,Solid 4 star brunch spot in the Mission. Swung by on a Saturday with a reservation (only available for parties 4+) and was quickly seated after my whole party arrived. You view the menu via QR code and someone swung by to take our order 5 min after we sat down. We decided to do family style in order to try everything. We got:1)Poached Chicken: Unanimously our fave dish.  Lots of chicken, bone included. Very flavorful Jook. Wish there was less chicken and more Jook since the Jook was so tasty. But I guess since it's called the Poached Chicken, makes sense to have more chicken than porridge. 2) Ube Pancakes: our second fave dish. You definitely need the Ube cream to go with the pancake. Very fluffy, pretty, tasty pancakes. They are huge so definitely recommend splitting. 3) Pork Belly. The pork belly itself was tasty, but the rest of the dish was meh. Too much rice as well. Wish there was more pork belly. 4) Taho Parfait. Would skip this. Flavor was meh and the tofu wasn't silky enough. I also ordered the Ube horchata which was yum.,We came here for brunch on a Sunday and it was filled with people. It definitely lived up to the hype and reviews! Just a reminder to those coming with a big group - they only seat you once everyone from your party has arrived.I love ube so we tried their ube foam coffee and ube hotcakes, and they were so good! I would say that the ube foam coffee just tasted like normal coffee after the ube foam was mixed in so I probably wouldn't get it again. We also got the chilaquiles and Tito boy, which were both so flavourful and worth the try!Definitely come here for brunch if you're in the area!,This has been my go to place for brunch lately. This last time we went on a Friday morning and there was no wait. I ordered the Vietnamese coffee with ube foam. Doesn't taste like your standard Vietnamese coffee but it's still delicious. Creamy, lightly sweetened with a hint of ube. For food, we ordered Tito boy, chicken wings and waffles, and ube pancakes. Tito boy - their version of shrimp and grits. Shrimp is standard size, nothing to write home about but the sauce is out of this world. It's flavorful and delicious and the jalapeño add a hint of spice. Loved it! Chicken wings and waffles - slightly disappointed with the chicken this time. They were not chicken wings but boneless chicken pieces that were over fried and dry and hard. The sauce they use is good but the chicken was not. The waffle is your standard waffle but they have a sesame butter that I love. Ube pancakes - were perfect this time. The last two times I was there, the pancakes were a bit burnt on the bottom but this time, they were good. The pancakes are covered in this creamy ube sauce and sprinkled with some strawberries and blueberries.,I was excited to finally visit Alnico in San Francisco and was blown away by their delicious ube dishes. As an ube enthusiast, I was thrilled to see that they had ube hotcakes on the menu and immediately placed an order. The hotcakes were vegetarian and came with a generous helping of ube coconut sauce and fresh berries. They were fluffy and flavorful, and the ube coconut sauce added the perfect touch of sweetness.I also ordered the ube horchata and was equally impressed. The horchata was creamy and had an ube flavor that complemented the hotcakes perfectly.I visited on a Sunday morning, and the restaurant was quite crowded, both inside and outside. There were several people who had to wait for a table. My friend and I were lucky to be seated relatively quickly, but it's worth noting that you may have to wait if you visit during peak hours.Overall, I had a wonderful experience at Alnico and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for delicious and unique ube dishes in San Francisco.,I came back here and was disappointed in the service.They rushed us out as we were finishing the last sip of our mimosa.The food was consistent as it was last time I was here.This review is for the lackluster service. We waited 40 minutes, which we didn't mind. However, allow us the time to finish our drinks. Not worth the wait for the type of service here. I can definitely spend $120 for 2 at a brunch elsewhere and get better service.,Think I had too high expectations for this place but I was wowed in other areas to make up for the things i found mediocre. Came here on New Year's Eve to celebrate a friend's bday. The rain and flooding delayed everybody so by the time everybody arrived, we were being rushed to order. But even when we did order, everything seemed like they were coming out late. Understandably it was a weekend. But you know how it is when someone is waiting for their food while everyone else already has theirs. I think the only thing that I truly liked was the ube pancakes. Definitely better than yogur story in HI, and that says a lot. The mix of berries with the ube sauce was absolutely perfect. I honestly could've ordered another one for myself, but I'm watching my figure for the new year. We got the shrimp and grits and short rib loco moco and it was just meh. Even the strawberry yakult alcoholic beverage was lacking flavor :(It's always a gamble when going to a fusion restaurant. It was great to try but won't be a reoccurring restaurant on our dining list,Yummmy! If you looking for that picture perfect Sunday brunch spot Alinco definitely delivers! The beautiful Uber purple makes any picture POP. Not to mention the pancakes are quite light and fluffy with a slight coconut flavor. Definitely a delicious bite and not overly sweet! We also tried the tofu sigsig which was also a hit. Served over a bed of rice this dish will definitely fill you up. Although I wished the tofu was crispy the marinade made for a well seasoned bite. Seeing the iced coffee with ube foam we knew we wanted to try it! The coffee was pretty smooth and the ube foam added a extra flare of flavor and color. Overall a delicious drink if you like sweeter coffees or lattes!,Cute brunch spot! Similar to Sweet Maple, Alnico serves Asian-fusion inspired brunch items. Service here was great; we didn't have a reservation but were still able to be seated immediately. After we had sat down, our server noticed our table was wobbly, so he grabbed a door stopper to fix the wobbly leg, so kind of him! Food was decently enjoyable. My only complaint was that sitting outside, the food got cold quite quickly, so it would be nice if the kitchen could send out dishes at a higher temperature to offset that problem for outdoor diners. This is definitely a place you get a drink with your food. There's a lot of cute and fun options but the Vietnamese Iced coffee with Ube Foam was my easy favorite. It was not overly sweet, and had an interesting look with the purple foam top! The foam cream was super tasty as well. In terms of food, the Ube Hotcakes were a bit heavy, but a great portion size. Might be a good dish to split with a group since the flavor of the Ube cream can get a bit overwhelming much too fast. In moderation, it is enjoyable, and the hotcakes were super fluffy. The chicken karaage and waffles was so good! Great flavor to the chicken, and the dish was freshly well balanced with the garnish of cilantro and radish. The waffle itself was well paired with the black sesame butter, for a very salty and creamy finish. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes very instagrammable food!,It's exciting seeing more elevated Filipino restaurants pop up :) The food was all beautifully presented and everything tasted pretty good. The poached chicken and the chicken & waffles (amazing black sesame butter on top) stood out the most to me. The loco moco is also a solid pick with very tender meat. For drinks, the horchata was great. The meat, eggs, and vegetables were perfectly cooked and the drinks were done well. Some constructive feedback for the food is I want to see some more flavor in all of the items. The poached chicken could use more ginger, more seasoning in the loco moco, and more garlic in the garlic rice. The fish was beautifully crisped but needed more flavor in the side sauce as well. I came here for brunch after making a reservation for 6 on a Friday. The restaurant was pretty busy so I'd make sure you have one. You can make adjustments to the party size by phone if you don't see the options you need on Yelp. The interior has a modern aesthetic. Service was decent though they're running slightly understaffed.,Filipino breakfast inspired by American brunch.  This is a place that not only does the food look good it tastes good too. It exceeded my expectations.Ube  hotcakes: pretty, not too sweet, it's huge so meant to be shared, it was a bit light on the ube flavoring, I wish it had a more pronounced flavor.  The pancakes were fluffy and to me the ube sauce was the star of the show.Branzino with toyo-mansi sauce to dip it in and the side of tomatoes and onions is what made this meal delicious.Steak and eggs: Top pick in my book my favorite. Perfectly charred with so much flavor and the chimichurri was tasty Ube horchata: just the right amount of sweetness This is a perfect place for an introduction to Filipino food with it's delicious food!,My friend made it a point to take me to Alnico during my visit to SF. It was a short walk from Noe Valley. After putting our name down they said they said they couldn't seat parties under 4 inside. There was plenty of room and they had my friend, fiancé, and I sitting outside in the pouring rain. We saw there was a party of two sitting inside and were confused as to why we couldn't wait longer for a table inside. The table umbrella only covered a small portion of our table and my fiancé was getting rained on. It was freezing and we were all miserable. Despite our experience with service, we enjoyed the rest of our time. The food made up for our chilly breakfast experience. We got the Ube pancakes which were delicious and I loved the coconut shavings and fruit. The star of the dish was the Ube coconut sauce. It helped make a regular pancake packed with flavor especially cause ube is a more subtle taste. We also got the Ni loco mo ako (loco moco) which was a funny name for the loco moco. The slow cooked beef was tender and was perfect! Absolutely delicious! I enjoyed the savory pairing of this dish to balance out our Ube pancakes. I'm Filipino and am skeptical about modern Filipino food places, but Alnico has this place down! Love how they honor Filipino culture and make it a upscale breakfast experience!,Wow, this is a good breakfast. It has all right mix of savory and sweet.I feel in love with their chicken congee, it was savory, spicy, and warming. It was also presented well in a to-go container allowing me to eat this delicious dish and still avoid crowds. The chicken was tender, but bone-in so you need to work a little more to get to all the meat, but since it's soaked in the congee it's pretty tender.The ube pancakes were so good. I loved their fluffy texture and not so sweet taste (granted, they were willing to modify the dish to remove the powdered sugar). The ube sauce was packed separately allowing me to determine how much of the sauce I wanted to have soak into the pancake. Honestly the ube sauce was a standout on its own and I preferred to eat it separately. I know that probably was not the chef's plan, but it had an almost tofu or pudding like consistency which we loved. Definitely will continue to return to this eatery for to-go and explore some more of the options. Also, they were very prompt with their pickup times and friendly when we arrived.,Ube galore!! A blend of Vietnamese/Korean with a splash of Filipino love. Alnico is a must visit for brunch with their beautiful presentation. We ordered the 2 popular dishes; Korean waffle and ube pancake. Both were incredible!! Korean wings actually reminded me a lot of Vietnamese nuoc man wings. I believe the butter was black sesame, I could of ate a bowl of this alone. Ube pancakes have a touch of coconut as well, iykyk ube and coconut are a match made in heaven. Also tried the ube iced coffee, it is strong!! For those that love Vietnamese iced coffee, this is for you. They do not take reservations for tables under 3 or 4. We got a table fairly quickly not having a reservation but we lucked out as the line became long as we were dining.,Filipino fusion brunch in the Mission district. Went here as a party of 4 on a Sunday afternoon. I made a reservation for 1pm, and we were seated around 1:20pm since they were waiting for an open table.Street parking and a bit difficult to find parking. Customer service was okay, music is quite loud inside, and limited seating as well.All four of us ordered the Ube Horchata, it was good but a bit watery. My friend and I wanted to order the short braised ribs but they were sold out! So we ordered the ube hotcakes, chicken + waffles, and shrimp grits. The ube hotcakes were good, very coconut taste and not overly sweet. The shrimp grits were okay, a bit bland and needed more salt. Lastly my friend said her waffles were dry and overcooked. For the chicken it was party wings and they were crispy and well seasoned.Overall a pretty solid brunch place.,I am honestly impressed with Alnico! I came here with two of my best friends, and we waited at most 10 minutes. For a party of 3, we ordered A LOT.Items:1) Chicken Wings-N-Waffles - Really enjoyed the wings! Very crispy and juicy with a honey soy glaze flavor.2) Ube hotcakes - Big portion! The ube was light which i loved!3) Poached chicken - This was my FAVE dish. The chicken comes with ginger-rice porridge, fish sauce, black chili oil, toasted garlic, an egg, and chicken chicharron! It was so good and reminded me of comfort food.4) Vegan tofu sisig - Not bad but I was hoping the tofu would be crispy but it was different.5) Niloco mo ako - Slow cooked sesame soy short ribs. The meat was was so yummy and tender!I also liked their Vietnamese coffee, although I thought it was was pretty strong haha. Definitely will be coming back to this place!,I got the mini ube hotcakes and they were pretty good!! I liked that the pancakes themselves weren't too sweet; the ube syrup was definitely the best part! I loved the garnish of fresh fruit on top. Overall, I had a good experience here.,We really tried to like this place especially since restaurants are struggling during Covid-19, but there was just too many things wrong with this place.The number one thing that is wrong with this place is the service.  Even though we were seated right away since there were empty tables, it took a long time for us to get our food or to get any service besides dropping off the drinks we ordered.  I admit we took a while to order because we were waiting for a waiter to take our order since the sign on the table said to order and pay with a server, but a waiter never came to us once we were seated, so we ended up ordering online.  Also, the people that sat down after us got their food before us.  It was especially obvious that one of the waiters gave our food to the table next to us since they brought the Niloco Mo Ako as well as the Ube French Toast that they didn't even order.  If my mom didn't hunt down a waiter to complain, we would have been waiting another hour for our food.The Niloco Mo Ako was okay.  It was cooked fine and had a decent sauce that didn't taste awful, but the dish lacked flavor.  If you ate the Meat by itself without any of sauce, it would taste really bland.The Ube French Toast was okay.  It was nice having the Ube Paste mixed in and baked into the bread itself, but the Ube French Toast was dry.  It needed some sort of sauce since it was still pretty dry even with the Ube.The Fried Chicken and Black Sesame Waffles was okay.  The Waffles were meh since the Black Sesame flavor was only in the Butter.  If they actually put it in the Batter, it would have given the Waffles more depth in flavor.  As for the Fried Chicken Wings, they had a crunchy Skin, but I have had better tasting wings before.Overall, this place was a total let down and not worth the time or money we spent going there especially when the food was nothing special and because there is little to no service there.  They might as well have robot waiters since the waiters only came to drop off the food and drinks.  They didn't even check to see if we wanted a refill.  So, definitely would never ever recommend this place or come back here.,This place has been on my list for the longest time and I finally tried it.Came here on a weekday morning and it was nice and quiet. Only 4-5 tables around 10:30AM. There was only one waitress and it didn't seem like she enjoyed her job.Ordered the ube French toast and unfortunately, it looked better than it tasted. The ube flavor was there (not too sweet), but the toast was really dry. I prefer my French toast more buttery and moist. Some of the blueberries that came with it weren't fresh.The whole experience was disappointing. I definitely would not wait or go out of my way for this place.,Overall 3.5/5. Ube hotcakes 5/5. In my honest opinion, the only things worth getting are the ube dishes/drinks. The mochi waffle was good too (not pictured) but everything else we ordered is good but overpriced - for example, (tho i might be biased cuz I'm Cantonese) I think you can get much better congee at any HK restaurant for half the price. And you can actually eat some congee and not just a big thing of chicken. That being said, I'll go back just for the ube hotcakes. I don't normally like sweet over savory but mannn. We also asked for extra ube sauce and it's $2.,A girlfriend and I had brunch at Alnico over the weekend. Fortunately, we got lucky and didn't have to wait too long to be seated, approximately 15-20 minutes. After looking over their menu, we decided to share their famous Ube Hotcakes and Steak & Eggs. For drinks, we ordered the Vietnamese Coffee with Ube Foam.The food was yummy! The Ube Hotcakes looked IG worthy with the bright purple coloring and fruit toppings. But most importantly, it tasted good. The hotcakes were soft and chewy with a light ube flavor. The Steak & Eggs were delish and helped to balance out the sweetness from the hotcakes. Recommend ordering this combo if you are into sweet and savory. Lastly, the Vietnamese Coffee was tasty, however, it didn't taste too unique to me despite the ube foam.Staff was friendly, but I can't say they were attentive due to the full house. However, that wasn't an issue for us, as we were too busy eating and catching up. All in all, food was tasty. Definitely worth trying out if you're in the city, but prepare yourself for a wait and check their business hours as they are currently only opened Thursday-Sunday.,My all time favorite brunch spot! I've been here so many times and have brought so many friends and family to try it. They're only open Thursday-Sunday 9am to 2pm. They have both indoor and outdoor dining. You can make reservations ahead but if you decide to walk in, I suggest coming right at opening so you beat the crowd. They serve Filipino breakfast and it's a wonderful place to try a lot of dishes and share with friends. Chicken Wings n Waffles - SO GOOD. After I had it the first time, I came back again the following weekend just for this dish. The chicken is crispy and glazed in sweet soy. The waffles are topped with black sesame butter which I wish they gave more of because it's so delicious. Poached Chicken aka Arroz Caldo - warm, inviting, hug in a bowl. If it's cold outside this is the dish that I want. It's porridge topped with chicken, chili oil, egg, cilantro, onions and chicharron. I've had pretty much everything on the menu and I can say that I loved every dish. Also, try out their drinks! They have a great mix of cocktails and unique drinks like Ube Horchata, Dirty Calamansi Shirley Temple and Vietnamese Coffee with Ube Foam.,Was there for the weekend menu brunch. Food was good:Got the ube hotcakes- Excellent. The pancakes reminded me of mamon, delicious and buttery. The sauce reminded me of ginataan.Niloco mo ako-  Not my favorite. Thought the quality of the short ribs weren't could've been better and the sauce didn't really go together in my opinion. Fortunately the garlic rice and egg was good on its own.Drinks saved the day:Dirty mango mansi- Really good. The drink looked cool and the flavors were refreshing.Mimosa w/ guava- Good.Vietnamese coffee with ube foam- Coffee was really good, the foam didn't really taste like ube in my opinion, but the foam was still good. Would definitely want to try to the other things on the menu. Went here as a party of 16 and the service was great. Felt taken care of.,This place is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G I would totally recommend this place! Totally worth every penny! It's an asian filipino ish fusion cuisine with a touch of instagram worthy pictures! There is reservation required for four people! Luckily my friend had the time to arrange all this!Niloco Mo Ako was chef's kiss! Sesame Soy Short Ribs was perfect! The meat was so soft and melts in your mouth! The sauce was so perfect I never tasted anything like it! Tito boy was so unique I was amazed how delicious it was. I usually eat grits with milk and condensed but dang I was surprised how it tasted! Thumbs up! Too bad they didn't have the congee I wanted to try it.Matcha Mochi Waffles and Ube hotcakes are the most prettiest darn thing to look at I just wanted to stare at it! Hotcakes and Waffles are so fluffy I just can not get enough of how good it was It can totally feed 3 people! So worth it! Drinks are of course my favorite first thing to look at is the alcohol/cocktails menu. Haha....I wanted to try each one of them but had to contain myself again. We were calamansi overload it just brought back memories back home! I will definitely come back and see you guys again :),Delicious Filipino fusion food! The black sesame butter with the waffles and the flavor of the chicken was so yummy. The ube in the hotcakes was strong and not too sweet, paired well with the Vietnamese iced coffee. Food was on the pricier side, not a brunch place I'd stop often.The service was just good. I understand waiters are really busy, our waiter came by once and we didn't immediately respond and she just walked away. When taking our order and giving us the check she seemed a little impatient with us. She did however check on us a few times which we appreciated!Great spot for foodies in the bay area!,A delicious Filipino brunch spot that tastes and looks good! My friend made reservations for her birthday brunch here. I would highly recommend making a reservation because the line is extremely long, and even if you do reserve a spot, they won't seat you until everyone is there. If you are going with a group, I would also recommend sharing family style because the portions are so big and it's best to try different dishes. We got about 6 dishes and my favorites were: ube pancakes, tofu sisig, tots, and vegan patty. The ube pancakes really do taste as good as they look in pictures because of the sauce. I could skip the ube French toast next time. I liked that there were plenty of options to accommodate the various dietary restrictions on our table. I also got a guava juice which was great, and others seemed to enjoy they Vietnamese iced coffees and alcoholic beverages as well. I'm definitely coming back!,Drove through floods and one of the worst storms in the bay to celebrate one of my best friends here for lunch and the food was totally worth it! We had a party of 16 and I was surprised this restaurant could hold us, but the food service was fast and efficient. All of us that ordered were beyond satisfied with how good everything tasted! Good portions and everything was yummy! It does get pretty loud in there.,Yummmmyyy!! Came here early on a weekday for a quick breakfast with my friend and it was so tasty!! Lucky we came on a random weekday because if it had been a Saturday/ Sunday I'm sure I would have had to wait. Once you walk inside the restaurant your are surrounded by light from the sun and windows. There is a lot of space and seating inside as well. The menu was just the right size with a good amount of items on it. We had ordered the pancakes, viet iced coffee, and short rib adobo. Everything was super flavorful and the potion size of the items are shareable. So come hungry!!,FINEST FILIPINO BRUNCH SPOT IN TOWN!! Lives up to the IG aesthetics for sure. Everything is really picture ready. We got the grilled branzino-silog dish and the niloco mo ako (short rib) and it was soooo yummy. The short rib is so melt in your mouth tender and gave a generous portion of protein in both our dishes. I would highly recommend it. We also got an order of ube mini hotcakes and they were HUUUGE!! We could not finish it and so glad that we got the mini version instead. It was the most beautiful plate of pancakes I've ever seen and had strong ube flavor.  Cocktails were good! The Dirty Mango-mansi lives up to its name. Could be dirtier hehe but really delicious citrusy drink. Was bummed about the ube horchata though. It didn't look like anything from the pictures since it was missing the ube whipped foam on top. Also tasted like a normal horchata, no ube flavor. So I would skip that. Service was great! Super friendly and attentive. I also GREATLY appreciate that our server stepped away when it came to the tip portion. Nothing like induced anxiety when people watch you tip.We came early Friday morning 9am just as it opened so no wait and we thankfully found a bunch of free street parking.,If you like ube and delicious Filipino flavors, they've done that well. Also, note that their portions are big. We went, just two people, and we were so glad we only ordered the mini Ube pancake instead of the normal size because that was perfect and the large size we would have not been able to finish. The niloco mo ako and that combination of garlic rice and the tender short ribs and the runny eggs and sauce. Wow, couldn't stop eating it. Highly recommend getting this dish. Best to make a reservation for the weekend brunch time but we saw the line move pretty quickly as they got people in and out fast.,Been seeing this filipino inspired brunch place which seemed like it would be refreshing from the classic thai brunch places, so took a couple friends to try it out. DRINKSViet Coffee with Ube Foam: For a viet coffee, the coffee itself is extremely lacking in condensed milk for that creamy sweetness that is in traditional viet coffee. The ube foam also didn't have much flavor and didn't add depth to the drink. Simply got aesthetic. 2/5Ube Horchata: Super excited for this drink and was throuple hot disappointed. It was neither an ube drink or a horchata. The ube flavor was very subtle and the horchata flavor was overpowered by the coconut that I believe came from the ube. The drink also was room temp before being added so it quickly diluted in the ice. 2/5FOODUbe Hotcakes (not pictured): Super excited for this as well but disappointed. The hotcakes were extremely dry and didn't have any ube flavor to them. Literally tasted like pancakes but were purple. The ube sauce could have saved the hotcakes but once again, super diluted in ube flavor which is apparent looking at the color of the sauce. More coconut notes than ube. The berries didn't really compliment the ube. 2/5Matcha Mochi Waffle: Once again, the waffle was dry and didn't have any flavor. However the matcha spread was delightful. Super rich and had a good contrast in sweet and bitter matcha taste. The waffle definitely tasted better with the spread on top. I expected the waffle to be a mochi waffle but the mochi was actually on the ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ide. The berries and red bread complimented the waffle really well. 4/5Pork Adobo Chilaquiles: This was the best dish. The pork was extremely tender and flavorful, pairing well with the salsa and tortilla chips. My only issue was that the chips got soggy but I guess that's expected in a chilaquiles/nacho style dish. 4.5/5Steak and Eggs: The steak was really dry for a medium rare steak. I don't think the marinated or added any seasoning besides salt and pepper, which for a non high quality meat, wont add any flavor. Luckily the chimichurri sauce saved the steak. Super fragrant and pleasant to eat. The slight tartness and saltiness of the sauce worked well with the steak. The rice was your traditional garlic rice with soy sauce, nothing special. 3.5/5Overall, a little disappointed considering I've heard so many things about it. Definitely recommend the pork adobo chilaquiles and the matcha mochi waffle but wouldn't come back.,Everything we ordered was so delicious! The only concern is that this place is pretty pricey /:,Best brunch experience I've had!! The crowds and Tiktok videos raving about this place are so right! Definitely make a reservation if you plan to go on the weekend or else wait time will be 1+ hours. We had a reservation for our party of 6 at 11am on Saturday. Once everyone in our party had arrived, we were seated promptly. I ordered the ube horchata and Korean fried chicken and waffles. The ube horchata was disappointing because didn't taste much like ube nor did it taste like good horchata. The Korean fried chicken and waffles were SO GOOD!! The chicken was so crunchy and savory. The waffle had black sesame butter and syrup on it that just melted into the hot waffle. My friends were also raving about their dishes too, which were the ube French toast, ube hot cakes, and grilled branzino-silog. The Ube French toast runs out pretty early so if you want to try that one, you gotta order it quick! The restaurant atmosphere is very loud and lively. The restaurant staff were very quick and good about getting the people with reservations seated quickly. I will definitely be back to try more of their menu items.,AMAZING BRUNCH SPOT!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE ALNICO! You gotta come here to try their Filipino Fusion Brunch.Alnico is probably best know for their ube hotcakes. At first, I was hesitant to order them, since I wasn't too experienced with ube & I usually prefer a savory breakfast. However, I saw that you were able to order a half-portion, and ordered it as a side. and YUMMMMM so good. This serving side was perfect to spit as a side among a group & to get a taste of the moist pancakes and delicious ube flavour. These are probably my favorite pancakes EVER??And anoooother star dish = their poached chicken porridge. omg yummmmm im salivating thinking about this. the porridge is so flavorful & the black garlic chili oil is divine. a must order if you're craving something savory!! I only wish I could make porridge this yummy myself.,Alnico was the best brunch I've had in a long time! This Southeast Asian Fusion spot in the Mission blends the best of sweet Ube and Matcha treats with amazingly flavored savory dishes like glazed fried chicken and soy-marinated short ribs. This place was packed on a Saturday morning so I highly recommend you make reservations ahead!Alnico gets 5 stars for SAFAV: Service Ambiance  Food Alcohol  Value-for-Money,Kept seeing this place on social media and as an ube lover, I had to go!! We had a reservation for a party of six and showed up prior to our scheduled time, but they had accidentally seated too many walk-in's so we ended up waiting an extra 20+ minutes (not too bad though). Besides that the service was good!Our order:-Ube hot cakes: probably one of my top items that we ordered. it was HUGEEE!!! We were about to order two plates but one was enough for all of us. The ube was pretty coconut-y and a little sweet, I thought it was decent but my party really liked it. -Ube horchata: I think a regular ube latte would've been better haha. This was more horchata with little ube flavor-Chicken wings-n-waffles: the waffle was meh and the black sesame butter tasted just like butter. HOWEVER. the chicken was good! I like soy chicken so I really enjoyed this one. -Matcha mochi waffles: I thought it was gonna be a mochi waffle but i think it was just a waffle with mochi on top? It felt like it mainly toppings lol which was enjoyable!! probably wouldn't get it again though. -Pork belly (special item): It was good! Pretty standard dish but it was a great way to balance all the sweet items we ordered!!-Vietnamese coffee with ube: strong coffee!! I loved it :)Not sure if I would come back, but I would definitely recommend trying at least once!,Checked this place out for brunch with friends and we tried a number of dishes.  FoodThe pancakes were the best, highly suggest The tots and bacon were overbooked a bit Overall it was good, the food was really good and plates are huge!Ambiance It does get crowded and loud, suggest you go early since it closes at 2.,This place gets BUSY after 10am. So beat the brunch rush and go right at opening on a weekday/weekend. The drinks:The calamansi mojito honestly didnt take anything like calamansi which was disappointing. It tasted like green limeade gatorade with a hint of alcohol. The ube horchata IS NEVER CONSISTENT. Sometimes, you can taste everything. The cinnamon, the ube, the cream. But this time. It was watered down. And faintly tasted like Ube. Plus, the other times came with a foam/ube cream on top. If you look at other photos of the ube horchata, you can see the drastic difference.The foods:The Tito Boy barely came with longanisa. And it came around 6-8 tiny pits that felt like it was more of a garnish to the gritz. There was also full pieces of cilantro with STEMS. Like the cooks didnt even try plucking the cilantro. Just threw it all. The shrimp was cooked fine. And gritz were overall good. The dish had pieces of shrimp tails with no meat. So maybe while it was cooking or being plated that it got cut off. But I do not recommend this dish. The loco moco Ni Loco mo ako. AMAZING. Succulent meat with a rich gravy over garlic tice. Perfectly cooked over easy eggs and crunchy garlic pieces. This was so good. The meat was tender and juicy. And it was seasoned perfectly. It wasnt too heavy, but very filling! Could honestly share between two people! Recommend for weekday menu!The ube hotcakes. AMAZING. The ube glaze was the star. It was sweet and very creamy. The hotcakes itself looks so aesthetic and eye pleasing, but tasted mainly like butter and flour. It needed ube halaya or some extract to develop a deeper ube flavor. The macapuno on top was great, and I wish there was more on top, but it was a great addition to the ube hotcakes. If they replaced the powdered sugar with more coconut flakes, it would be a solid 10/10. The service was overall good. I felt bad there were only two servers for about 14 tables with 50+ people. The inside was very chilly since they left the doors open for deliveries or something. It was open for about half the time we were there. But overall. Great place. Not always consistent with the food, but always worth a visit.,Been here for brunch twice and both times were memorable. First time it was just my husband and me. We showed up with no reservations and was able to be seated at the bar quite quickly. The place was packed, but service was fast. The second time we were a group of 4 and we it was raining. Even then, the place was still packed.Honestly, you can't go wrong with any option. The portions were huge and all the non-alcoholic drinks were so good. The regular potion of ube pancakes were huge. Chicken and waffles were so crispy and the glaze was not too thick or thin. The savory options help balance the sweet options so I'd recommend one of each if you're going with friends. Make a reservation if you're going with 4 or more people!,Great food and great service! Five star for me. The wait on a Saturday is around 45 minutes.,I came here for my birthday brunch with friends, and I really appreciate that they offer reservations on the weekend - that's rare! The full party must be present to be seated, but as long as you check in around your reservation time, you should be okay. The stars of this Filipino brunch were the ube hotcakes (super pretty and fluffy; the sauce definitely helps keep the pancakes moist) and chicken wings-n-waffles (chicken was crispy, and that black sesame butter is so yummy and unique). For the crab cake Benedict, given its price point at $30, I was a bit bummed that the poached egg was fully cooked and that there was only one crab cake. It was thick, but I think I'd prefer two smaller ones, one for each of the buns. Regardless, I'd be down to come back and try out their other menu items!,Based on the raving reviews that I had seen about Alnico, I had high expectations for today's brunch. However, I left feeling disillusioned and bored. Every food and drink looked lovely and beautiful, but the flavors lacked boldness. Even though the Vietnamese iced coffee seemed promising enough with its colorful presentation, the purple foam on top did not taste like ube in the slightest. I would have been better off with a free cup of water since it tasted startlingly similar to my diluted coffee. The only tasty item that I tried today was the ube French toast, which was sweet enough to enjoy without syrup (that the staff forgot to give me).Ultimately, the disappointingly bland bites did not justify the 30-minute wait in line on top of the hourlong wait at my table. I understand that busy mealtimes may result in unexpected wait times and short-staffed kitchens, but I do not want to return.,Came here on a Saturday around 12:30 PM. My party of 2 didn't have a reservation but we got seated in about 30 minutes, which is surprising since there seemed to be a long wait time and this was a pretty popular place. Ube French Toast (5/5): I really enjoyed this dish! The french toast was nice and fluffy, and the ube mascarpone was delicious. Not too sweet and didn't leave me feeling extremely heavy. Tito Boy (4/5): This is a shrimp and grits dish. I've never had shrimp and grits before, so I didn't really know what to expect. It basically tasted like porridge (which I think is what grits is). It tasted pretty good, though there wasn't really any heat to it. The egg was delicious. Kinda wish they took off the shrimp tail shell though. Service was generally good. They kept checking up on us and refilled our water when needed. Parking in this area is difficult. Spent 45 minutes circling around for parking, which was really unfortunate. I'd suggest to take public transit or uber/lyft.,As a huge ube fan, I've been wanting to try this place for the longest time and finally had a chance to have lunch here! I came on a Friday afternoon and waited for around 30 mins to be seated. All the food was freshly prepared and delicious!! FOODChicken and waffles (4/5): The sesame butter was the star of this dish! The flavors were so unique, and I enjoyed every bite. The waffle was a bit soggy, but still super good! The chicken was flavorful and delicious, and I loooved the sauce on it.Ube Pancakes (5/5): YUM! These definitely lived up to the hype and left me wanting more. The ube gravy (?) was divine, and the pancakes were light and fluffy. A must-have if you come here!DRINKUbe Vietnamese Iced Coffee (5/5): Such a perfect compliment to the meal! The ube foam was delicious, and the coffee wasn't too sweet. Also gives you a kick for sure, can't wait to try more drinks here! Parking is difficult, so I recommend ubering or taking public transport. Also recommend checking out the cute shops nearby while you wait!,My party of 3 came at 10am on a Sunday and the wait was pretty short - definitely recommend coming early. We came at 12pm another time and they said they were no longer taking people on the waitlist. I ordered the ube horchata with whipped cream. The whipped cream was the star of the show - the actual drink itself was decent. Ube pancakes were pretty good. The sauce was better than the actual pancakes. Mini size pancakes is good for sharing if you already have other entrees. Poached chicken porridge was bomb! The chicken was super juicy and tender. Short ribs with garlic rice was also delicious :),Every dish we had was excelent. The Ube Hotcakes are a must-have. I really enjoyed the Crab Omelette. The chicken and waffles were great, crispy and not greasy. We were too full to eat the tater tots we ordered but they were good. The drinks were delicious and beautiful -- wish I had remembered to take pics. Casual ambiance. What you'd expect from a successful brunch spot in the Mission.Service was pretty good, although expect a wait for weekend brunch even if you have a reservation. We'll be back.,Omg the Ube pancakes were to die for. I'm not even a sweet-breakfast person, but these were something else. The other dishes we tried were good (I got the chilaquiles which were good but nothing special), but the Ube pancakes were definitely the star of the menu. The Ube Vietnamese coffee was also delicious, so unique and creamy. Now with the food opinion established, here comes the tricky part with this restaurant. It is always packed. The service was average bc of the amount of people they have to serve and even if you have a reservation, you'll still have to wait a while for a table to be available.The table setting wasn't as cozy or high quality as their food, making the experience not as good. We had a party of 6 and sat at their high top tables in the corner of the restaurant which made it hard to get the waiters' attention. I can't imagine having a table outside, it's probably even harder to get service. I'd come back for the Ube hot cakes - probably to-go is the move since I didn't care for the ambiance at the restaurant.,A friend brought my fiancé and I here while we were visiting saying it was one of the best breakfast places in the Mission. I'll just lead by saying it was strange that we were told they won't seat parties of 4 or less inside. My friend said she's done so multiple times. So we were seated in the rain, wet chair, table etc. We also saw a party of two sitting inside as we were eating. So minus stars for that, everything else was great. We got some mimosas, the ube pancakes, and their version of loco moco. The pancakes were fluffy, not too sweet, and had a delicious coconut sauce. The loco moco was tasty. Nothing special, but wasn't bad , and was a nice savory dish to pair with the pancakes. The food was overall great, just wish we had better service. But I'd come back to try it again later,I was so excited when I arrived on Friday morning and it wasn't super busy! This is a Filipino American brunch spot. This restaurant really hit the spot for me making me feel at home. They were also playing all the throwbacks making me sing along while eating. The service was really good and attentive.Now let me tell you! The food was on point. Everything I expected I got! The garlic fried rice really tied in all the flavors for my meal and my boyfriends. The grilled brazino has no bones which made my meal more enjoyable. Adding the tomatoes and mango really gave it the Filipino touch. The Ube horchata was sooooo good! It was not overalls sweet and was very refreshing. I love how everything was platted nicely. The menu was small but had variety. I would definitely go back here!,Food:Ube Pancakes 10/10 the star of the show!! The cream is truly BOMB you cannot come here & NOT get it!KFC & Mochi Waffles 8/10 really unique flavors together. Loved this but I would order something else next time.Short Rib Loco Moco  10/10 to die for!! Steak & Eggs 10/10 loveeeed this calamansi chimichurri sauce. The steak was seasoned perfectly to where sauce wasn't even needed.Vietnamese Coffee with Ube Foam 10/10 - my bf rated this bc I can't handle coffee but he says that the foam pairs so well with the strong coffeeService: 10/10 very attentive!General: come with a reservation or be prepared to wait! Also try to come early without a res. Parking is kinda difficult & is street parking!,We went here for a weekend brunch last week. We had the tofu sisig, the branzino silog, and the ube pancakes. Everything was SO good. Portions were generous and the food was not too salty. We got to sit by the window and it wasn't too crowded, although we got there right when Alnico's opened. My only complaint- the tables are too small lol if you want to order a lot of food.,Hidden gem in the Mission!! We had a reservation for weekend brunch for five. Shared 3 dishes among five people, and we were sufficiently full after! The ube hotcakes in particular were huge and very filling. Every dish we got was so flavorful, and the textures were perfect. The only complaint is that the ube horchata was very different from the delicious drink the people in my group ordered previously - it was very slimey yet watery and missing the foam at top. Fortunately, the waitress replaced my drink with the calamansi for free, which was very refreshing. Definitely looking forward to returning for the other dishes!,I was absolutely excited to try this new Filipino brunch spot after seeing sooo many amazing TikTok videos and IG reels on this, and the raving reviews on Yelp. We absolutely LOVE ube and so me and my best friend decided to give this place a try. It was a rainy Saturday morning, and we came in early at 10 AM to hopefully snag a table before the brunch rush, which was the BEST decision made! Soon after 5 minutes or so, we got a four top table all to ourselves, SCORE! Upon arriving at the table, we were handed their brunch menus, to which the waitress quickly took our orders. Now, unfortunately, our visit here did not meet our expectations or satiate our ube cravings.What we ordered:**DRINKS:-Ube Horchata - This had such a beautiful hue of purple and smelled wonderful, but sadly it was very watered down and the ube flavor was not present. -Ube Vietnamese Coffee - This was yet another beautiful drink with ice cold Vietnamese coffee topped with an airy ube foam. Again, the ube flavor was not there. FOOD:-Ube Hotcakes: I don't know if I'm just spoiled by Yogurstory's Ube Pancakes in Hawaii, but this did not take the cake for me. The ube flavor of the pancakes did not stand out and was overpowered by the coconut. I understand that the pancakes were supposed to be ube coconut flavor, but honestly the ube was just for looks and not the flavor. (Seems to be a pattern in all the ube items we had ordered)-Chicken Wings n' Waffles: YES! The waffles were perfectly crisp and fluffy topped with the tastiest black sesame butter... omg. The chicken wings were cooked to perfection, a beautiful golden and crisp batter with juicy chicken meat.- Crab Omelette: This was the omelette of the day,  and it was pretty delicious but nothing that really blew my mind. It was packed with lots of crab meat, came with a side of sliced avocado and topped with a zesty spicy aioli and fresh arugula. Overall food was decent, however I wish that all the ube items actually tasted like ube. The food portions were very generous and presentation was on point! Each dish was enough to share, would recommend doing family style.**SIDE NOTE** I highly recommend coming EARLY for a table. Once we left the restaurant around 11:30 AM, a huge crowd of hungry patrons were waiting in line.,It's an absolute delight! We have great brunch places in LA, but this place has no competition in my opinion. Service: Service is decent, not great. We had to look around a lot to get our server's attention, but it wasn't all bad. Food: This is where 5 star comes into play. Food looked picture perfect dreamy and the taste over exceeded the expectations. We had bunch of food for the table and everything was amazing. Matcha waffle plate was one of the best. Soft and delicious waffle came with a side of matcha cream that was so so good. It also came with some fresh fruit and sweet beans. French toast, ube hot cakes, nicolo mo ako, pork adobo chilaquiles, were all extremely delicious. Ube hrochata was just perfect good.We even took hotcakes to go and ate the next morning and it was no different from the day before. If you have reservations and running late, they don't extend it even for few minutes. Something to be aware of. Parking is difficult, so planning accordingly helps. I can't wait to go back. This will be a must stop by brunch place when I visit bay area next.,Came on Sunday at 11:30ish told the wait was 45 minutes and got seated earlier. Outdoor seating available and doggo friendly. Seating is on Hill St which is the quieter side.Service was good and good came out really quick. The Vietnamese Coffee with Ube Foam is sooo yummy. That's a must order. We also got the Ube French Toast, the Matcha Mochi Waffle and the Grilled Branzino-silog. I would skip the Matcha Mochi Waffle cause it was just Mochi bits on top and not really Mochi waggle. But everything else was supper tasty ang want overly salty and flavor was on-point. And the price was very reasonable for everything that we ordered! Definitely will come back to try the rest of the menu.,I went to Alnico awhile back and now finally posting a review. Hopefully, my review is still relevant!Alnico just opened and I wanted to go cause of all their ube flavored stuff. For pictures, their food and drinks are gorgeous! The vibrant purple from the ube is so pretty. The inside looked nice and cozy. Their outdoor seating was decent. It was just a few tables and chairs on the side wall, nothing special. The wait wasn't too bad for a weekend brunch.The food was fairly good. Ube is hard cause it does t have a super strong flavor. The ube Vietnamese ice coffee and ube horchata were great. Super yummy. The pancakes were pretty good. It didn't have a special taste that blew my mind but still ate it all up. The grilled pork was good. It came with vinegar which really complimented the fatty pork. Overall, I do like the place and would come back.,"Orders: 1. Mini Ube HotcakesThe hotcakes were pretty good but it honestly didn't really taste very ube. Even though we ordered the """"mini"""" version", it was still a decent size and very filling! I really liked the sauce and the fruits as they added tied the whole dish together. Overall, I really did enjoy the hotcakes even though the taste of ube wasn't that prominent. 2. Steak and eggs The portion sizes here are soo big! Surprisingly, I really enjoyed the rice that came with the dish. The steak was cooked perfectly and I would highly recommend this dish if you come try Alnico out!,My friend & I came here on a Friday at 1pm with reservations, but the restaurant was pretty full -- definitely recommend making reservations!  As expected, the ube hotcakes were the star of the show. The hotcakes were hot and fluffy, and the ube coconut ~gravy~ on the bottom was really, really good --so fragrant and perfectly sweet. Coupled with the beautiful berries & flower on top, plus a generous portion size, we really enjoyed this dish --definitely worth coming here for!  We weren't as impressed by the chicken & waffles -- the dish wasn't served hot, and though the wings were crispy and the waffle was fresh, it wasn't worth ordering again. We were intrigued by the black sesame butter, and while it was interesting and added a nice nuttiness, it wasn't particularly memorable. Not pictured was the ube Vietnamese coffee latte we got, which was really expensive and watered down. There wasn't much liquid under the foam, and the foam itself didn't have a very strong ube flavor. Overall, would definitely come back for the hotcakes and try a few other dishes next time!,Been to this place a couple of time and there was 2 dishes I tried that were outstanding! While the other 3 were only alright. The later you come in the higher risk for sold out items. When I went on Saturday at 12PM their Loco Moco was out. When I went Saturday 1PM all dishes with garlic fried rice, porridge, and Branzino were sold out. So just beware of the day/time you come and be prepared with multiple options to order! Also they only accept reservations for parties of 4 or more.Food that I loved... The Ube pancakes were bomb and so fluffy. The ube flavor was present. I personally think a small stack is more than enough for 1 person to eat. I ordered the large and I could barely finish it. My friend had the Branzino. It was flaky, juicy, and delicious. I wanted to get this the next time I went but it was sold out.Food I wouldn't get again... The crab cakes Benedict, nachos, grits were alright. Crab cakes barely had any crab on it and the egg was not runny. The flavor profile was a little off for my bf and I. My bf couldn't eat more than a few bites so we switched meals. I got nachos which was decent but nothing special. You can't mess up chips, cheese, and toppings! I do wish the toppings were more evenly distributed. The grits was not bad but just not something memorable to get again. Definitely wouldn't get these items again unless it's the only options on the menu. The drinks... I tried the Dirty Calamansi Shirley Temple and it tasted super sweet and barely of alcohol which is perfect for me. So recommend getting that if you hate the taste of alcohol because that drink will be perfect. A drink to avoid is the Lychee Sangria. Definitely could taste the alcohol and barely had any lychee flavor. Wasn't sweet and just wasn't for me. My bf got the Uber Vietnamese coffee which was strong and good, but he barely can taste any of the ube when he was drinking it before and after he mixed in the foam. The Ube horchata tasted exactly what is sounded like, so if you like horchata you'll like it! I would try their other cocktails if I come back!This place is easily accessible by Bart (just a few blocks away). Since it's in the Mission area might have a hard time finding parking near the restaurant, but my bf and I drove once and was able to find parking 10 mins away. Overall, decent place with some miss food options and very aesthetic food but I wouldn't actively seek this place out when I crave brunch. If someone wants to go and recommends to go, I will go, but besides that I think 2 times was enough for me :),Came here with a friend on a saturday morning so we weren't surprised it was busy. Definitely try getting here early to avoid a wait. We were really excited to try the food here because we have high expectations for asian fusion ofc but we're ultimately disappointed.Service: The service was a bit slow because of how busy it was but I would still probably give them a 4/5. Not much to say they give took our order and served us our food.Food: We ordered the tofu sisig, korean chicken and waffles, and ube vitenamese coffee. Ube vietnamese coffee was okay but definitely just a drink people order for the aesthetics. Ube flavor is hard to taste in ube flavored foods so I wasn't surprised when it just tasted like vietnamese coffee. My friend told me the tofu sisig was okay but a bit too oily for her liking. The korean chicken and waffles were probably a 3/5. There were a lot of flavors going on between the really strong chicken glaze and the sesame butter. I actually really liked the sesame butter and the chicken was juicy but the soggy waffle really ruined it for me. Overall I would give the food a 3/5 but the price and crowd wouldn't justify eating here again.,Overall," I must say this is one of the best hole in the wall """"breakfast/brunch"""" spots I have seen so far. I had the chicken and waffles and I gotta admit", the chicken was really tasty. It had the perfect amount of glaze and flavor and I thought it was a good portion size. Also, I'd like to mention that the Ube pancakes were top notch, but I will mention that this is really filling, so if you have a big appetite, it's perfect. I definitely will go here in the future on the weekends, if I recall correctly, they have a weekday menu and a weekend menu, so while the weekday menu when I went was limited, it still was worth every penny. Will I come back for the weekend, definitely.,Make reservations if you don't want to wait. Chicken and waffles and tots was my favorite. The chicken wings are so flavorful, not too sweet and super crispy. Tots were hot, crispy, and made perfectly for tot lovers.The Ube foam and Vietnamese coffee is a must. Great atmosphere! we had two young servers who were very sweet, but didn't do a great job on checking if we needed anything. We had to bother other servers to get them. We'll return for sure! Thank you for the great experience.,I visited on a Friday around noon and was able to grab a table without waiting. I ordered the ube hotcakes and brown sugar bacon on the side.I wouldn't recommend ordering the hotcakes as a item for one person. It would be better as a dish to share with friends. On its own, it's way too filling and gets old after the first couple bites. The brown sugar bacon is a must-have for any brunch. I would get a smaller protein-based dish next time I visit.,I love Alnico! The food is yummy! The dishes are aesthetically pleasing! And yes, it is rare to have both! My friend and I came for brunch on a Saturday morning and we were seated outside the restaurant with no wait. From looking at the menu, I loved how they took a Filipino fusion approach to their brunch such as serving Silogs, Pork Adobo Chilaquiles, Ube Hotcakes, and short ribs with a clever Filipino pun - Niloco Mo Ako!My friend and I decided to get the Ube Hotcakes and the Chicken Wings-n-Waffles. The Ube Hotcakes were so pretty and vibrant! I loved how our cameras accurately caught the prettiness of the hotcakes as it was a sight! Surprisingly enough, the taste of the hotcakes were amazing! It was soft and spongey which my friend and I both compared it to eating mamon (Filipino Sponge Cake)! The Ube Coconut Sauce was also phenomenal as it was not too sweet and complimented the hotcakes really well! The Chicken Wings-n-Waffles, on the other hand, were also amazing! The wings were honey soy glazed and we loved how it was fried perfectly where it was tender in the inside and crunchy on the outside. The waffles were also great with the black sesame butter which we thought was original! Overall, this is a great brunch spot within the Mission District! Love the food! Love the presentation! Love how it is original and Filipino infused! Are you craving brunch within the Mission District and want to try a new fusion? Go to Alnico! Take pics while you are at it! 11/10 :),"Oh wow!!! These were the first two words I said when I saw our food. """"OMG"""" was exclaimed after our first bite!  We came in for Saturday breakfast. We got there around 9:30 and were seated immediately at the counter. I ordered the Niloco Mo Ako", which is slow cooked sesame-soy short ribs with garlic rice, 2 sunny eggs and green onions. OMG! So succulent, so warm and comforting. The sesame-soy sauce was both a little sweet and very savory. The sauce was perfection, and it being absorbed by the garlic rice, it was a savory taste explosion. My wife ordered the Ube Hotcakes. They were adorned with fresh berries, a beautiful orchid, and surrounded with Ube coconut sauce. This was an ube-lovers dream. You could actually taste ube in the hotcakes. And the slightly tart berries contrasted the rich, decadent ube coconut sauce. I loved the fact they brought me my coffee in a French press. The Vietnamese iced coffee with ube foam was an inventive twist. While dining, the placed filled, including all the outside tables. The service was attentive and quick. They all seemed to be working together like a well-oiled machine: managing to attend to a full house and bringing out food quickly. Cannot wait to go back and try everything!,Came here on a Friday afternoon and got 2 of each dish.  Overall really good, only downside is their menu is much smaller on weekdays compared to weekends.Their ube hotcakes have a strong ube and coconut flavor, and they give a stack of 3.  Definitely a good choice if you're craving something sweet and flavorful.  The chicken wings n waffles are also a strong choice.  The chicken is nicely fried and covered with a delicious sweet glaze.  The waffles were topped with a sesame butter and were also quite good.,Omg Alnico is probably one of my favorite brunch places in the bay area now! First and foremost, very happy that they take reservations. I feel like it's very rare to find brunch places that take reservations, especially for large groups during the weekend. I went here with a large group (15 of us) for a reservation in the morning on a Sunday (peak day for brunch!). Super glad they were able to accommodate such a large group.I came in here with no expectations. Some of my friends in the group had been before and wanted to go back and try more of their foods. I am a brunch lover, but I do find that most brunch places have relatively the same kinds of foods (hopefully this isn't too much of a controversial opinion). I love that Alnico had a Filipino fusion take to their dishes. Everything on their menu looked good, but the ube hotcakes stood out to me so I decided to order that. My boyfriend got the grilled branzino-silog. We both got a ube horchata to share.. kind of wished I also ordered the ube vietnamese coffee because that looked delicious as well. Everything came out perfectly and exceeded expectations! The coconut sauce on the hotcakes/pancakes were out of this world. It complemented the ube pancakes super well. My boyfriend and I shared our dishes so I also tried  grilled branzino-silog. The branzino was grilled so nicely - it had a nice char to it on the outside while the fish was not too dry. It was seasoned very well too. I've had several grilled fish where the fish was so dry that I couldn't finish it. The eggs were also cooked very well, I love a good runny yolk on my sunny-side ups! Just writing this review, I'm already starting to crave the grilled branzino-silog. The ube horchata was also very good though I do feel like it looked nicer than it tasted (still was delcious!). The horchata seemed a little watered down and I couldn't really taste the ube with the drink. My boyfriend really enjoyed it though.This is a brunch place I would 100% be going back to when I'm in SF. A lot of my friends got the poached chicken and I really want to try that dish next time! Also really want to try that ube vietnamese coffee!,I got the tofu sisig. I believe this was one of few vegetarian options on the menu. The portion was huge. Super savory and the mayonnaise based sauce was delicious m. There was great flavor in the rice as well. I only wish there were more vegetarian savory options to choose from.We had a reservation but they didn't have our table ready and we waited outside for around 25 minutes. The restaurant is relatively new and super busy on the weekends at brunch. So I highly recommend making a reservation in advance and checking in a little early so they know to have your table ready.,Is Alnico another instagram-worthy brunch spot in SF? Yes. Is it worth going to for the food? YES. SF has so many instagrammable brunch places that are overpriced and serve brunch food that's average at best. Alnico's food is actually delicious and different. My friend and I split a short rib rice bowl and the ube hotcakes - both did not disappoint. It was so good that we ate every last bite (portion sizes are big too)!Their drinks look super pretty and tasty too...I didn't order one this visit but will definitely have to try one next time!,This was one of the first places I went to in San Francisco. I recently went back with two of my friends that I lived in the Philippines with. The brunch Filipino fusion food is ABSOLUTELY A MUST TRY. The waitlist fills up and the wait can be a couple hours if you are a leisurely bruncher. The waitlist will fill up- so plan ahead! Once inside at the table, waitstaff is efficient and the food is presented beautifully. The ube latte and ube horchata were both delicious. The ube horchata is a nice option if you don't need *another* latte. The ube pancakes, niloko mo ako, and poached chicken were must trys! It's a great spot to go with friends to look at the beautiful food, take pictures, enjoy a boozy brunch and immerse in a food experience like none other!,Yes, the ube hotcakes are the star of the show. But the surprising thing is everything was good at Alnico!It's a brunch spot on the corner of Valencia and 21st which you can overlook because there isn't a lot of signage. It's a popular brunch destination so make sure you make reservations in advance. I love ube anything so I ordered the ube horchata and my friend ordered the ube thai iced tea. They were both so pretty and tasted delicious. We then each ordered our own entrees. I had the tocino with the traditional sunnyside up egg and rice. Reminded me just like how my Lola makes it. The fish plate was just as good and served a big helping of fish. The longanisa is not your typical longanisa and didn't have enough caramelization, but my friend seemed to enjoy it. We shared the ube hotcakes - which I heartily recommend. The portions are HUGE. Three of us couldn't finish one order, and I saw one table ordered one per person. I think you do get a smaller order if you're two or less, but it's still a lot! I highly recommend this place for brunch, especially if you love ube!,Dropped by for brunch with friends on a Friday around 11am and luckily there was no wait to be seated. My friends and I shared this family style. I really enjoyed the ube hotcakes. Usually, I am not a sweet brunch person, but I really enjoyed this as it was not too sweet. The ube sauce and ube drinks were very well made and were not overpowering at all which I thoroughly enjoyed. The food is well portioned and we definitely came out full with some extra for takeout! Really worth the price. We got chicken tocino silog, vegan tofu sisig with added fried egg, grilled pork belly silog, and ube hotcakes. The drinks we got were guava mimosa, mango mimosa, vietnamese iced coffee with ube foam, and ube horchata. Everything was very tasty and I would definitely recommend to friends.,This brunch spot has unique and beautiful Filipino inspired dishes. I came with a group of friends and was luckily able to get a reservation the weekend of since we tried coming here before but the wait was too long. All the food here was super flavorful and the presentation was beautiful. We shared 4 dishes between 5 people and left more than satisfied. I usually don't drink coffee too much, but the ube foam and coffee here was delightful. The crab omelette was really good and the crab tasted fresh, I would say it was one of my favorite dishes. The ube pancake was more than just looks, the sauce was really nice and the pancakes were fluffy too. Overall, parking can be a bit tricky, but there should be some up the hill in the street up. The service was nice and the spot was decently sized for a San Francisco location. The food was good and enjoyable, especially if you want a photogenic location with good pricing and taste.,After seeing an IG influencer post their lychee sangrias on my feed, I knew it was a wrap to check it out! We came in on a Saturday around 11ish where we were able to get seated right away. Ambiance was simple, but appreciated the early 2000's throwbacks playing in the background! We ordered:* Ube hot cakes- def HUGE and shareable. Fluffy, lightly sweet, and just the right amount of ube sauce to top it off. Fav and a popular here! * Adobo chilaquiles- was ok. Not much adobo flavoring on the shredded pork which made it bland. The green sauce was overly much which was the only thing we tasted. Plus, this came out room temp which made it just ok overall. * Lychee sangria- needed more lychee flavor as the sangria was more potent. * Iced ube latte- good! My bf liked this. Not overly sweet as well. Will be back to try other items, but enjoyed overall :),Alnico is an Instagram worthy, Asian fusion brunch spot located in the Mission District. I had been reading reviews and following Alnico's Instagram for months, excited to finally try their delicious looking Filipino desserts. Unfortunately, my party's experience at Alnico fell short in both service and flavor.There are no reservation times available on the weekend, however, the restaurant IS open! You can call ahead to make a reservation, or put your name in and wait 45-60 minutes at the restaurant. I called to book a reservation ahead of time, but when we arrived we ended up having to wait 20 minutes for a table anyways.The presentation of Alnico's food is exquisite and draws a huge foodie crowd. Everyone and their mother will be photographing their dishes and drinks when they arrive. We ordered the Pandan Waffle, Ube Hotcakes, Vegan Tofu Sisig, Ube French Toast, Ube Horchata, Iced Coffee with Ube, and side of brown sugar bacon. All of our dishes looked awesome but the flavor wasn't there.The restaurant's staple dish, the Ube hotcakes, were okay in my opinion. Unfortunately, my bottom pancake was badly burnt and the hotcakes were drowning in sauce. Considering two of my favorite ingredients are Ube and coconut, I truly have no idea why this dish wasn't a home run for me. The hotcakes are also MASSIVE! I would definitely recommend sharing them with 2-4 people or ordering the mini hotcakes as a personal serving instead.The pandan waffle reminded us of buddy the elf's spaghetti because of the random addition of fruity pebbles and a neon green, bitter tasting whipped cream. The poison looking whipped cream tasted like vodka, making it almost painful to eat. I have no idea why these ingredients were added, especially considering the other pandan waffle pictures have normal whipped cream. Overall, the dish just looked and tasted like a mess.The French toast and Ube horchata were tasty but not something I would choose to order again. The vegan tofu sisig was bland and my friend ended up barely eating it. Amazingly my favorite part of the entire meal turned out to be my side of brown sugar bacon! It was tremendously tasty and I wish I had more.Overall, I'm disappointed to say that Alnico missed the mark. If I were to ever return I would order the fried chicken and waffles and hope that I had more luck with the savory dishes.,Very authentic Filipino fusion brunch with large servings and wonderful service! went as a party of 2 and got seated right away at the bar area,Did somebody say brunch?? And Filipino food? Sign me up! Located on the corner of Valencia and Hill St, there is 2 hour parking on Hill, if not, Guerrero St. I would highly recommend making a reservation, I've seen the wait and you can wait for a while during peak hours. My first visit here we got:- Crab Omelette - definitely lacking crab, the taste is standard for an omelette. I would recommend trying something else on their menu- Poached Chicken - it's a congee with boiled eggs and chicken. Very flavorful and hits that comfort spot. If you're not a ginger fan, I would skip this one- Grilled Branzino-silog - this would be my recommendation to try! Grilled sea bass and their homemade sauce is *chef's kiss* also hits the spot with their tasty garlic rice! - Ube Horchata - tastes like a horchata with a hint of ube, I still would recommend! - Vietnamese Iced Coffee with Ube Foam - for you coffee lovers, this is the drink for you! - Ube HOTCAKES - soooooo good, so rich, it's def worth splitting between you (and three other yous). It will get a little heavy, so hope your stomach is ready to eat a lot! So the majority of the things were good here, which is why I came back a second time. This time we got:- Omelet of the day, which happened the be crab - I didn't order this my bf did - this is really not worth the $30, especially the presentation and the lack of crab meat - Niloco Mo Ako - ribs were packed with flavor and meat is tender- Steak and Eggs - ever wonder why it's always on a breakfast menu? Yep, it fills you up and probably have to take it home for leftovers- Vegan Tofu Sisig - can't comment, I like meat - ROUND  UBE HOTCAKESTLDR - Hype brunch, darn good, make reservations, get ube hotcakes, ditch the crab omelette,Went on a Sunday morning with my boyfriend and I'm so glad we went right before they opened because there was already a small line forming. The staff were friendly and the food was delicious! I got the Niloco Mo Ako, which was pretty filling. It's different from the usual loco moco because they use short rib beef for the patty so it was kind of mushy with the eggs and rice. My boyfriend wasn't expecting his dish to be so soupy, but it still tasted good.,TL;DR - Unique brunch fusion that is completely worth the visit.We went here randomly to grab a table around 1pm, the wait was around 30-minutes. Not bad. If you're looking for a place with outdoor seating, this is the place - as I see lots of pet owners and parents waiting. We tried two of their drinks Vietnamese iced coffee with ube and it was extremely decadent! It was super yummy, and I mix the foam. I had to slow down because I almost finished it right away.I got their shrimp and grits, it was a ton of food and so savory. The branzino was such a damn good deal. You can taste the char too and it was extremely filling. The bacon on the side is also very decadent and worth the try!,Pros: I am visiting from SoCal and I was surprised to see a Filipino brunch place here in NorCal! I appreciate the twists on classic dishes like Arrozcaldo (Poached chicken) and the ube dishes. I got the Niloco which is a nice twist on a loco moco. There was a good amount of meat and it was a beautiful presentation. Half of the portion was enough to make me full. I also got the French press which was 2 full servings of coffee including cream. Cons: Unfortunately, without a reservation, we ended up waiting about 2 hours. Although the food came out rather quickly (~20min) it lacked overall flavor considering I grew up eating Filipino food (Tried but not pictured: tofu sisig, ube hot cakes, chicken & waffles). In addition, all the dishes (mine and my friends') had a sweet flavor even for dishes we expected to be savory.,Vegetarian friendly score: 3/10We came here after Yelp prompted this place for a brunch. Attracted by the ube pancakes pictures, I made a reservation. We were running a few minutes late for the reservation and so I wished to call restaurant to inform. Neither of the phone numbers provided on google or Yelp work. Fortunately we still got our table immediately after arriving. Service was good and quick. We order vegan sisig, ube pancakes, chicken waffle for the husband and side of eggs. I found the sisig to be okay in terms of flavor. Ube pancake was definitely the star. Weirdest thing was side of eggs which was very disappointing as it felt like there was no effort spent there. Very oily cooked pieces of egg whites.,Very cute brunch spot in the Mission. The ube pancakes were the best! It's light, fluffy dough served in delicious ube cream. There's a rich milk coconut flavor. Not too sweet. Highly recommend. Not to mention the aesthetics of the plating are beautiful with the vibrant purple colors. They give a huge plate, so it's honestly enough to split between 2-3 people.The garlic rice with short rib was also incredible. Flavorful rice. The meat is tender and marinated in savory gravy sauce. I really loved the carrots in it. Just wish the portions were bigger on this one. Be warned the wait here can get long because it's so popular. Had to wait around 30min for a table.Overall a nice brunch spot with unique food. Would recommend.,Another great find. We don't get to SF often but this place will have us going back. I'd get here early if you are planning a visit. They open at 9am. We arrived at 855 the line was short but within a few mins BAM full restaurant. Staff is super friendly. I asked for a recommendation and it didn't disappoint. We had the Tito Boy (variation of shrimp and grits) it was delicious. Full of shrimp, Grits, jalapeño, sausage it was wonderfully comforting. I had the Vietnamese Coffee with UBE foam. It was tasty. Vietnamese coffee is strong. I could run a marathon right about now lol....my BF had a the Bronzino Dish with rice and eggs. He devoured it. We had a great early brunch. Such a great find don't miss out on this place. Pics attached are the Shrimp n Grits and Vietnamese Coffee,Super solid brunch spot! Lots of unique and eye-catching dishes on their menu, and I'll have to come back to try other ones. We ordered the Ube Hotcakes (ube sauce was very tasty, recommend getting the mini stack if you just want to try it), Niloco Mo Ako (Alnico's take on a loco moco), Crab Omelette, and Chicken Wings-n-Waffles.Niloco Mo Ako was my favorite dish - the meat is very tender and the combo with the rice and gravy is so flavorful.The drinks are also great! We ordered the Vietnamese coffee and Ube horchata. I didn't finish my horchata, so I brought it home and added an espresso shot the next morning for an extra kick~Definitely recommend a reservation - we ended up waiting over an hour for a table of 4 on a Sunday afternoon. Parking on the neighboring streets isn't too bad, but you might have to circle a bit.,I came here with one of the closest friends around the area and this was a second trial for us since when we came last time, we got there too late at around 12pm that we could not even put our name on the waitlist. This time we got there at 11am and waited only for 30 minutes to get seated. Inside decor was pretty simple and the counter seats that we were navigated were not really aesthetic. Most items on the menu were Asian fusion such as sisig or tito boy and we ordered fried chicken and waffles and ube pancakes as we saw a lot of other tables were ordering and thought it was their signature menu. The pacake was with the vivid purple ube sauce which was very pretty and aesthetic but the taste was very mediocre. There were three layers of pancakes but all of them were thin and too airly that I didn't enjoy the texture. The ube sauce was also just sugarly and I didn't taste ube that much. The waffle came with the chicken was pretty good and the sesame butter on top made the wafftle really flavorful and delicious.The food quality was I would say the average but the service and how fast the turn was as a very popular place made the experience good. The dishes that other people were ordering such as shrimp rice or congee looked really good so I want to try them next time.,When my family and I came on Sunday during prime brunch hour, there was a MOB outside the door. Alnico needs a better system to line up guests away from the main door and allow for reserved guests to check in easier. Swimming through the crowd was nothing short of an exercise with several passive aggressive comments sprinkled in. No, I'm not cutting...!! I'm responsible and made a reservation so please, excuse me!However, once we checked in, our table was ready in minutes. Perfect. We were seated inside which in retrospect was very loud and I should have asked for outdoor seating. Oh well.I began brunch with the Vietnamese iced coffee with ube foam. The coffee was strong and robust but finished with a velvetty smoothness. You don't get much ube flavor unless you purposely scoop the foam, which was definitely worth scooping up at the end.For mains, my brother got the chicken and waffles, mom got the famed ube hotcakes, dad has the salmon with garlic rice (they did not have branzino this day) and I got the shrimp and grits.The only dish that fell flat was the salmon. It was grilled so dry that it was essentially jerky. My personal favorite was my brother's chicken and waffles. The waffles came with a dollop of black sesame butter which was SO GOOD. The chicken wings were fried perfectly and tossed in a sauce very reminiscent of the famed San Tung chicken wings on Irving. It was not the traditional soy garlic of Korean fried chicken fame. It's honestly one of the closest renditions to San Tung wings I've had so kudos because those wings are also an experience to have. The sweet and spicy flavors really played well with the smoky nutty notes from the butter.Mom's ube pancakes were just as decadent as expected. She actually gobbled them up despite not having a huge sweet tooth. She really enjoyed the pronounced ube flavor. When it came to my shrimp and grits, I loved the jammy egg and the deeply rich seafood consomme. However, I could tell that my grits had been sitting a while before it was finished with the accoutrements and consomme. It was dense like a cake instead of creamy and soft. I had to use the back of my spoon to press the consomme into each bite but that also meant that halfway through my dish was dry because the grits drank up the consomme like it had been walking in the dessert for a month. I boxed it up and I'm going to rehydrate it with milk at home to the right consistency.All in all, Alnico is a gorgeous brunch. Despite coming with arguably high price tags, the plates are quite generous and very filling. If you have the opportunity to try Alnico, I definitely would.,Walked in at 10:30 am and got seated pretty quickly. We opted for the chicken wings and waffles and the ube hotcakes. Both were really good. My favorite has to be the chicken wings and waffles. The chicken wings were sweet, crunchy, and super delicious.,"The UBE Vietnamese coffee was super strong and bitter and the """"ube"""" for the drinks (we also had UBE horchata) were more food coloring than actual UBE flavor. Same with the pancakes.. a little more flavorful UBE sauce but I think the coconut milk helps. The shrimp and grits were just OK. But the surprising stand-out was the """"Niloko Mo Ako"""" (braised short rib with garlic fried rice", sunny eggs and gravy). First of all, I love the play on words for the name. I could taste the beef nilaga. The loco part comes from the delicious gravy.. an ode to the Hawaiian favorite (loco moco).  I don't know what they put in that gravy but it was sooooo good! And the garlic fried rice underneath the sliced meat was amazing and super tasty.,If you enjoy Ube, you must give Alnico a visit. This Filipino brunch place is usually booked out weeks in advance but we lucked out and found a spot 1 day before (probably a late cancellation).We love asian inspired flavors like coconut, matcha and Ube so this spot was right up our alley. The Ube horchata was probably the favorite part of our brunch - it looked like it might be too sweet but it had just the right amount of sweetness and it was refreshing. The Ube pancakes were good too although we'd recommend going with the mini version as we couldn't finish the large version even with 4 people splitting it. The chicken and waffles were also decent - the chicken more so than the waffles (which were a bit soft for our liking),Found out about Alnico through Tik Tok and it was a Filipino inspired Asian fusion brunch and I was so excited to come here for some Ube and pandan goodness. Since my friend and I decided to walk in last minute we knew that reservations were going to be hard to snag so we came right when it opened around 9:30 to get bar seating and immediately after there was a huge line (so if you plan to walk in definitely come in early). We ordered the tofu sisig with a fried egg and it was simple but delicious. The jalapeños and green onions were a nice touch but tofu and rice is always my comfort/go to. Our fun dessert was the pandan waffle which came with whole azuki red beans, coconut, jellies, and pandan whipped cream. It didn't taste a lot like pandan but it was very colorful and a nice sweet dish. My absolute favorite part about my meal was my drink which was the Ube horchata. I wish there was less ice but overall so delicious and not overwhelmingly sweet.,"3.5 STARSAZN kids have it lucky these days because they don't have to be embarrassed of the lunches they bring to school. Bring on the AZN funk and """"weird"""" stuff because it's trendy now.Hmmm on a second thought", probably best to leave the patis, bagoong, or durian at home though, unless you want to kn*ck someone the eff out and evacuate the building. Filipino food is underrepresented so it's great to have Alnico in The Mission, even though it's fusion. It may be a good gateway for pinoy food virgins. Alnico is only open on the weekends for brunch (indoor and outdoor dining) and it's poppin' so def come at/before opening time if you can't secure a rezzie on yelp. Arrived 15 minutes before their 9 am opening and was second in line. When they opened their doors, there was about 20+ in line (Mother's Day). Even with the mandate lifted, staff wore masks.M E N U Filipino fusion/inspired brunch fare (I read the chef is from 1608 Bistro, Lower Pac Heights). Vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free friendly.Wine, beer, sangria, soju, and mimosas available. F O O D*** Food spread: bit.ly/3yrZL8D* Ube Hotcakes w/ ube coconut sauce, berries (Mini - $14)The hype is REAL! I thought this was going to be an overhyped, made for the gram dish...but it wasn't. l could NOT s-t-o-p eating these hotcakes and this is coming from a savory over sweets person. The soft and fluffy hotcakes were swimming in a vibrant, deliciously rich+creamy ube coconut sauce that was nutty and vanilla-y with a light tropical sweetness from the shredded coconut. The fresh berries added a slight tartness creating a well-balanced dish. I usually find Filipino sweets hella sweet but not the case here. GET THIS!!!SPECIALS:* Tito Boy: Shrimp and grits, corn, longanisa, shellfish consommé, butter, green onions, cilantro, jalapeños, 6 minute egg ($22) Starting with the positives, the consommé was comforting and well-spiced and the 6 minute egg had an oozy jammy yolk. The not so good? The grits were cold, congealed, and molded to the bowl. The shrimp had a firm bite but bit into several to find they still had their shell intact.* Niloco Mo Ako: Slow-cooked sesame-soy shortribs, garlic rice, 2 sunny eggs, green onions ($24)This special sounded great on paper but was disappointing. The short rib cubes were mostly dry though the pieces with attached fat were a bit more tender. The sunny side up eggs were overcooked, and one of the yolks arrived broken and well-done. =( Garlic rice for days so had plenty leftover. * Hashbrowns ($6)Crunchy exterior but undercooked in the center. S E R V I C EFriendly and prompt. We were able to get in our order before they got slammed so our food arrived in less than 15 minutes. A M B I A N C EPacked indoor dining. Outdoor tables (8-10) are well-spaced out and on the side street with little pedestrian traffic. No heat lamps so dress warm. LOVE the 90s R&B music playing - TLC, SWV, Jade, and Adina Howard.I was waiting for One Vo1ce, Pinay, and Kai to drop. Lol. P A R K I N GDef get there early to snag street parking. Garage parking 1.5 blocks away on Bartlett & 21st. Overall, BOMB ube hotcakes but the savory dishes were meh. Cutting them some slack though because it was Mother's Day," probably one of their busiest days of the year and I noticed a """"hiring cooks"""" sign outside so the BOH is probably understaffed. 3.5 stars rounded up.",Tasty fusion brunch in the mission. The ube pancakes are a must try! Really nice coconut flavour and not overly sweet. Delicious. The chilaquiles were okay. They needed a lot more sauce to be chilaquiles. More like nachos, but still good. Everyone seemed to like the ube coffee drink as well but I didn't try that. Would recommend stopping by if you're looking for something a little different! Add your name to the waitlist and walk around Valencia St until they text you.,The ube coconut sauce on the ube hotcakes has some kinda crack in it. It's addicting, rich, and very much makes the ube hotcakes HAWT! Made reservations as soon as I heard about this place for a Saturday 12:15. I arrived on time and still had to wait to be seated because it was super busy. You MUST get the ube hotcakes if you come here. The pancakes itself were average but it really is the ube coconut sauce that makes it everything that it is. We got a mini and split it between two people! We also ordered the Tito Boy which was my second favorite. It tasted like the ocean with all the seafood flavor deliciousness. And it had chunks of longanisa which complimented the shrimp really well! I liked the idea of pork adobo chilaquiles so you already know I ordered it. But I wouldn't order it again. It's missing the adobo realness.For drinks, we ordered the Ube Horchata and the Vietnamese Iced Coffee with Ube foam. Both are aesthetically pleasing... but Senor Sisig is down the street from this place and has a much better Ube Horchata.  But I really did like the Vietnamese Iced Coffee with Ube foam! Again, CRACK!Thank you Yelp Bay Area IG for popping up on my feed with Alnico. Otherwise I would have never found this brunch gem!,*Review is based on experience from couple months ago*My friends and I had to wait about an hour but it wasn't as bad as there were a lot of stores to look around! So be prepared to wait a bit before being seated. Once seating, everything was pretty good. The food was a decent size and the drinks were pretty good as well. If I were to pick my favorite dishes, it would definitely be the waffles and wings or the niloco mo ako! Can't wait to try the other dishes one day!,Had this brunch spot bookmarked and was able to try it while a friend was visiting in town! We arrived at around 11:30am on a Sunday and was able to snag one of the last tables. We saw a few groups that had to wait but I don't think any of them waited for over 20mins.We tried the Ube hotcakes, Fried chicken with waffles and the Vietnamese coffee with ube foam. The ube hotcakes were so delicious - I really like Ube and I loved both the hotcakes and the ube sauce. The ube taste was strong (along with coconut) and the dish wasn't too sweet. We shared the regular size and couldn't finish it so I think we would've been fine with the smaller size. The fried chicken with waffles were also tasty. The chicken was done in a korean style - a honey garlic type of glaze, which is my favorite; it was fried pretty well. The waffles were good and went well with the black sesame butter. The vietnamese coffee with ube foam was just okay - I thought the ube foam didn't have a strong ube flavor; the coffee itself is pretty standard vietnamese coffee.Overall, a very solid brunch spot in the Mission; I will be coming back.,I really wanted to love this spot, but it just did not live up to the hype...While the food all looked amazing, we thought it all tasted okay. We ordered the Ube Hotcakes, Pork Adobo Chilaquiles, Chicken Wings-n-Waffle, and Tito Boy to share. I was most excited for the Ube Hotcakes, but they were pretty dry and there's not much flavor unless you had it with the sauce. The Tito Boy wasn't even hot and the grits lacked any flavor whatsoever. I did enjoy the chicken wings, but beware they are small and only a few come with the dish. If I had to choose one dish, it would be the Pork Adobo Chilaquiles! We also got a pitcher of the Guava Mimosa, which was enough for 4 people. Our first mistake was not making a reservation ahead of time, because I wouldn't say the food was worth waiting over an hour for. So definitely make a reservation if you do still want to try this spot for yourself.,Have gone here twice and both times the food was amazing! The ube horchata is a must. It's so creamy, I love it! It's so hard to decide what my favorite dishes were since everything is so delicious- but if I had to choose it would be:1. The Tito boy. It has a slight heat to it and the shrimp and grits are cooked just right, the broth that comes with it pairs perfectly with the grits2. The chicken and waffles. The black sesame butter tasted like black sesame ice cream and it was so tasty on top of the waffles. The chicken was also super crispy on the outside.3. Ube pancakes. They were the perfect sweetness and the plating made it ALMOST too pretty to eat. The pancakes were so fluffy as well4. Ube french toast. It was fluffy and the inside tasted like custard. They had an ube cream(?) to dip the French toast in as well which had a strong creamy ube flavor.The only dish that I don't recommend is the croque ma'am sir. It wasn't terrible, but compared to everything else that we tasted on the menu," it really paled in comparison. I highly recommend Alnico and will be coming back soon!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Routier,"they have soy oil in fryer, grapeseed oil in mayo, and possibly other oils used.Made a res and got in early, nice corner booth spot upstairs.Of course since we were there at 5:30p service was all ours for a while, but even after it got full (within 30-45 min) service was still great.We had the crab pave, pumpkin soup, cod, sole, and mousse.Everything was delicious!Good blend of flavors, the chef even made the crisped potato for the pave specially to avoid soy oil for me. It was perfect.Every bite was yum, fresh ingredients, decent size portions, spotless clean bathroom, we had a great meal and experience.No photos as we just enjoyed eating the food!,Solid casual neighborhood bistro, almost feels like you're in an outer arrondissement. The dungeness crab pave was the standout, but the other dishes, while solid, were rather forgettable. Liked the flavors of the hen of the woods mushroom. Though they were decent, I was bored by fish and short ribs.We weren't fans of the dessert menu, as it was very mousse heavy, and we were hoping for more pastry-related desserts (love b. patisserie!). We did ask for an order of fresh madeleines.,3.5 stars. Good but not great. The crab pave and the halibut were the best but the rest were a bit disappointing or just ok. The eggplant was served cold which surprised me and was on the sour side. I was searching for the mushrooms in the risotto and the short rib was dry and tough. The desserts were the best part. I enjoyed the ambiance, service, and the meal but likely wouldn't go back if I had to pay as there are so many other places I need to try still.  There wasn't anything special that would make me crave it.,TL;DR - DisappointingIn the quest to finish Infatuation's Top 25 in SF, Routier presented itself as my next target. Unfortunately neither myself or my hubby enjoyed our meal or experience.Easy to make a reservation, we were seated promptly. I put in two quick appetizers:- duck rillettes- brocoli raabI absolutely despised the duck rillettes - it was so flavorless and didn't spread well at all even though we did let it sit for a bit. It was boring. I'm grateful they gave us extra bread. The raab was my favorite dish of the night.We then placed a drink order, and while we were about to put in the rest of the order the guy who served us basically wouldn't let us. It was odd, and we didn't like that because we had a gap in the meal.For the rest of the meal, we ordered:- crispy squid- fennel salad- duck leg confit - crispy alaskan halibutI loved the cirpsy squid. It was different than fried calamari at other places; the sauce was good. I hated the duck leg confit. I loved the halibut but we did agreed it was small portion, and it was pricy because of the oddly topped truffle shavings. Overall, I'd skip this place.The good news is that there were lots of parking in the streets, not too hard to find.,Came here for dinner with friend. The overall ambiance of the restaurant was chic and quiet, so perfect place to catch up with 1-2 friends.I ordered the black cod and my friend ordered the corn risotto. The cod itself was very tender and aromatic; the portion was definitely on the smaller side. I tried a bit of my friend's risotto, which tasted great on a single bite, but was on the very rich side. My friend has trouble finishing it toward the end despite the portion not being that big. Overall I did like the food but not sure if it wowed me to any extent, especially given the price.,Atmosphere: Overall friendly staff - nothing out of the ordinary/what you would expect. Love the interior design and ambiance, great for date night or nice dinner with family. Food: 1) Dungeness Crab Pavé [8/10] : loved this one (kind of tasted like filet o fish on a hash brown) super hot, crispy, and fresh. A great start to dinner and would recommend. 2) Carrots and Green Strawberries [8/10] : personally love heirloom carrots - the strawberries add a nice sourness to the sweet carrots and brown butter. Had it with the duck confit and thought they paired nicely3) Monterey Squid [6/10] : pretty good, was essentially elevated calamari. The chili sauce was quite yummy 4) Hen of the Woods Mushroom [6/10]: umami and flavorful - the greens on top really added a nice freshness to the creaminess of the mushrooms. Personally enjoyed the carrots more, thought this dish was a bit salty. 5) Duck Confit [8/10] : superb duck - tender and meat melts in your mouth. The fig pairing also added a nice sweetness to the duck (was divine!!) Highly recommend as one of the main dishes6) Alaskan Halibut [5/10] : thought it was a bit overcooked, it was average fish, nothing special, but half of it probably is due to halibut's texture. 7) Peach and Blackberry Napoleon [10/10] : tasty dessert, not super sweet, light and delicate. The pastry is super flakey and the cream does not feel fatty. Highly recommend!!bOverall, above average restaurant. Good service, nice ambiance, good food (not blow me away fantastic but tasty and well executed),3.5 stars. Delightful restaurant with very nice staff. I really liked the different patterned plates on the table and food served on them.  It's so hard to find a quiet restaurant these days where you can have a conversation and actually hear each other.  This place offers that, at least the evening we dined. 3 in the group ordered cocktails:  veranda and midnight follies. All had citrusy flavors. We shared bites of each other's dishes. Tempura tuna - battered well cooked fish Duck confit - one was a tad too dry but the other was reported good. Eggplant - moist and tasty Short rib - good favor and tenderMushroom Au Poivre (Hen) - my favorite dish that evening, tasty but a tad too salty. Lots of mushrooms. Corn risotto - sweet and good with roasted hazel nuts and chanterelle mushrooms on topBeet salad - Hubby really liked this dish. Desserts- such a treat to have these made and served to us by Chef Belinda Leong, who worked that evening. Peach and Blackberry Napoleon- very refreshing and goodChocolate mousse- chef Belinda's signature dish at the restaurant and didn't disappoint.  Covered with a big scoop of whipped cream. Rose Vanilla Cream - hubby liked this one too. Our friend really liked the decaf Americano ordered with with our desserts. 5% mandatory Health tax added to bill.,S E R V I C EThink we started out a little off when I came in. We were a party of 3 but the table we received kind of felt a little small and cramped. Ours was also the only table of this size, which was kind of weird. Asked the hostess if we could swap for one of the many empty full sized tables and it took her a while to get her manager so we just decided to sit down. (3.5/5)P A R K I N GYou know how SF parking goes. We were able to score a spot down the block on a Saturday night though and even passed by a few others, which was surprising! (4/5)F O O DSomeone next to me got the mock tail and it looked good so I wanted to try. Waitress described it w/ ginger and rosemary but MY GOOSHH the ginger was strong and a little overpowering for my tastes. Started with the crab pave. I think the price might be a little over considering the amount of crab you get but it was still pretty good. Got the duck confit with strawberry which I honestly don't know how I feel about. The dish looked really drab and mushy and filled with browns. My mother got the halibut which also was room temperature and definitely could've been much warmer (possibly sitting out?) The dessert thankfully was much better. Got the mango napoleon and chocolate mousse and was at least able to end the dinner on a better note. 3/5 Also they don't have lobster anymore here if you're looking for it :( Waitress said the entire menu is slightly different,First things first, cool doorFriendly wait staff and serviceOrdered the prie fixe A three course dinnerThe perfect amount of foodShort rib was delish,Great !!!!Every single dish we had !!!Service was excellent as wellDefinitely coming back .,More like 3.5 stars. Great little French spot with decently good food and great service. We ordered the hen of the woods mushroom salad which was amazing. The short rib confit, corn risotto and dungeness crab bites were good but not great. The desserts were amazing!! Overall a nice experience but not a lot of standout dishes. Rounding down to 3 stars because I find this place to be quite pricey and not well portioned.,Slapped. Slapper. Place slaps. Great food. Great service. Cocktails a bit slow. Great mushrooms. Great duck. Crab potatoes. Good cock tails. Love this spot. Good good. Best in SF. We'll done. Cant be replicated. Small plates. Big plates. Good plates. Great plates.Must go.,Such a cute French restaurant. I was taken here for my birthday and we were seated upstairs which was intimate and quiet. For two, we decided on sharing one order of the three course prix fixe, two additional appetizers, and an additional main. We ate so well that night. My favorite dishes were the pumpkin soup, the mushroom au poivre, and the sole. They were all really rich, decadent, and flavorful. Perfect for sharing. I also enjoyed the crab pave and the vanilla mousse dessert. But I would skip the pork shoulder dish. We finished it, but some parts of the pork was dry. We didn't love the apple compote either.Overall the food was tasty and the restaurant strikes a great balance of being nice and a little upscale, but completely comfortable. We received excellent service and I couldn't stop raving about their beautiful French country looking plates.,Dinner review. Part of the B.

Learned what ""Pave"" was when we went here, lol. It was great we got a bunch of apps and cocktails and did kind of like a tapas style splitting situation. It was a while back so I don't remember everything and I think their menu is seasonal but their crab pave was phenomenal.,Cute neighborhood gem, the food is original and delicious, and the waitstaff is cheerful and professional; our waiter, Rick, had a great sense of humor and made our evening an unforgettable one.  Definitely will be going back there soon.  Highly recommend the shortribs!,For all you last minute fly by the seat of your pants people out there, this is for YOU. It'll seem like you planned this dinner for weeks because how else could you score a table here!SF dining is a mystery sometimes. How are you able to get a Saturday reservation for the day of at a place like this is mind boggling! Everything from the decor to the food exceeded my expectations. The English Pea Risotto blew me away while the Duck Confit was a miss for me. Personally I'm not a fan of sweet and savory with this none traditional duck confit that came with strawberries. The duck was a bit over cooked (crunchy and hard) in certain parts. Looking forward to coming back again to try other items!,Queen ""B"" was working her magic last night! My friend and I were lucky enough to snag a res at 8pm last night and we had a lovely evening. The inside is super warm and cozy, definitely makes you feel like you are stepping into a Parisian bistro for sure. We dined upstairs in an intimate nook. The menu had so many amazing choices but we came hungry....so decided to feast. Our server Decklan was polite and help guide us through our selections. To start:Beets w/ tarragon vinaigrette, citrus, celery yogurt and hazelnuts - 5/5 -- This dish was bomb. The flavors were all really unique and the citrus with the yogurt and the tangy dressing was fantastic. Each bite was delicious and we literally polished off the whole dish. Crab Pave bites - 5/5 *  -- O M G these little guys were so yum. I would have had a whole plate of them. The potatoes were so delicately formed into perfect little rectangles and the crab was fresh and fantastic compliment. Highly recommend. For mains:Lobster ""Grand Aioli"" - 5/5 -- 1lb of fresh lobster sprinkled upon a large platter of fresh raw veggies and 2 types of Aioli dips. I seriously have never tasted such fresh crunchy vegetables, it was as if they went to a garden and picked them and plated them! The lobster was great too. Sweet corn risotto - 4/5 -- This dish was a tiny bit too sweet for my palette but still good. I think we would have enjoyed the Farro and mushroom one better but it actually paired very nicely with the savory flavor of the lamb. Crispy Lamb Shoulder - 4/5 -- Very nicely prepared lamb, salty and great contrast with the sweet risotto. I found the peppers really interesting twist to the dish. You wouldn't expect it. For desserts:Roasted plums, berries, mascarpone with carmelized batons au beurre- 5/5 -- This one sounded meh but actually blew my mind. It was subtle and simple flavors but everything was of the highest quality. Kudos B! Strawberry cheesecake - 5/5 -- I only wish this was a bigger portion because I think I ate it in 2 bites! So delicious. I cannot wait to go back and bring friends. The meal was phenomenal. Love love lo,Quick Summary - Beautiful restaurant serving up delicious food and fantastic service. Great for a special dinner or just a casual, nice dinner! All the mushroom dishes and the mascarpone mousse were the highlights. - Dungeness crab pavé - Super popular item. They're tasty, exhibiting so much attention to detail and craftsmanship on the perfectly fried potato cube made of thin slivers of potato, but in the end, not worth the price for me. - Hen of the woods mushrooms ""au poivre"", egg yolk, and crushed fingerlings - Really fantastic. The mushrooms are flavorful and meaty on their own, but the raw egg yolk in the sauce took it to another level, adding another layer of richness and flavor. You bet I scraped that plate clean. - Farro and mushroom ""risotto"" with pecorino, brussel sprout leaves, and bacon - Savory, creamy, slightly chewy from the farro, crispy from the brussel sprout leaves. So good. It's not overly heavy or cheesy as you might think. - Pork shoulder confit, chard with apple and celeriac compote - Beautifully cooked, fork-tender pork shoulder. I thought the apple and celery compote was really nice and naturally sweet, pairing well with all the other elements. - Caramelized croissant, spiced poached apples with fresh cream - Not the kind of croissant you're thinking. Imagine a thin slice of some kind of loaf, but crispy. It was all delicious, but in the end, a crispy pastry with good apples and a quenelle of whipped cream. If the croissant was replaced by the type of croissant I was originally thinking of, or one of Belinda's legendary kouign amann's, I would've been more excited. - Mascarpone mousse with dulce de leche and crumble - I don't know what's in that mousse, but it's so so good and not too sweet. I loved the crumble on top that added a textural element to the mascarpone party in my mouth.Overall, a really good experience. The waiter basically walked through the entire menu with us after asking if it was our first time, which it was. So kind and thorough! Service was fantastic, everyone was super friendly, the plates were each gorgeous, and the environment and ambience was so cozy and classy. Most importantly, the food was delicious. I'll be back for another special dinner occasion!,The food here was great! We had a reservation for 6:30 PM on a Thursday night. To make the reservation, you have to put down a $20 deposit per person. It gets deducted from your check, though.To start we got a baguette and the Dungeness crab pave. The crab pave was GOOOOD. Flaky buttery potatoes, and the dill on top was a perfect flavor combo.We both got mains. I got the farro and mushroom ""risotto."" My friend got the roasted cod with corn. We both loved our dishes and didn't leave any food. Lastly, we ordered two desserts. The chocolate mousse and the caramelized croissant. The caramelized croissant was INSANE. The mousse was really good, but it was definitely outshone by the croissant. Don't skip dessert!!!!!!All in all, I would definitely come back here. We got a bottle of wine and ended up spending ~$100/person.,From the moment we stepped foot in the door the experience was incredible. Everything from the service, to the atmosphere and especially the food! Thank you for such a memorable dining experience. Favorite bite of the night - anchovy toast followed closely by the hen of the woods mushrooms. Everything was amazing though!,Had a great dinner last night at Routier. Waited too long to try, such a nice spot.  There was 5 of us so we started with the small plates and craft cocktails.  We shared the delicious Hen of the woods mushrooms, eggplant with fresh ricotta and crispy Monterey squid, all were perfect starters. We all ordered large plates, I had the best short rib confit with peppers in a shallot cream, a must try.  The others had the duck confit, halibut, and a mushroom risotto.  We all loved our dishes. We split the deserts, chocolate mousse and a roasted pear napoleon.  We also had a nice French Cabernet Franc bottle of wine.  The service was excellent, and the ambience feels very Parisian. I highly recommend, can't wait to go back and try more of the menu.,Made a reservation on a Friday night at 5:30pm. There was a $10 per person deposit at the time of booking that's taken off the bill following the meal. We got the crab pavé, chicken liver mousse, and duck rillettes for the table to share. I got the pork shoulder confit.The crab pavé was delicious. The potato was so fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside. It was the perfect vehicle for the crab. Chicken liver mousse was so smooth and creamy.  I wanted something more to go with the sweetness of the compote. Duck rillettes were okay. I didn't enjoy the texture as much. It could have been smoother. The bread that was paired with it was fresh and soft. I liked that the vegetables gave a bitter contrast for the sweetness of the jam. For both the chicken liver mousse and duck rillettes, there weren't initially enough of the multigrain crisps and bread, respectively. However, our server saw that and offered to bring us more.Pork shoulder confit was okay. It had a nice crust, and for the most part it tore apart so easily. Only thing was that there were parts that were moist and some parts were overly dry. I didn't enjoy the chard pairing too much, but I loved the figs. Our waiter was amazing. We weren't sure about what wines would be suited for our taste, so he let us try a bit of it before we decided on which glass we wanted.Bummed that I was too full for the dessert. Hopefully, I'll be back for it someday.,Love the ambiance you wouldn't feel like your on the corner of California street. The food from start to finish was delicious and well seasoned, I would like to come back and try more dishes but the corn risotto and duck confit really shined so flavorful and the duck was so tender. But please save room for dessert,I've eaten here a half dozen times in the past year and brought numerous friends. The food is always excellent, as is the service. Everyone has really enjoyed it. But I can't give it 5 stars for two reasons.  The seating area upstairs is above the kitchen and it gets really warm up there...no one wants to break out sweating halfway through their meal. They need to upgrade the ventilation, install a ceiling fan, etc.  I won't eat up there again. The other thing that really irks me is the corkage fee. I brought a special bottle of wine to pair with my meal and share with a friend, nothing even remotely similar to what they offer. I'm ok with paying corkage, but when you have a lot of $30 bottles on your menu IT'S OBSCENE TO CHARGE $45 FOR CORKAGE FOR 2 PEOPLE.  Also, the corkage fee is not stated anywhere.,Every aspect of the menu is fantastic; starters, sides, mains, and desserts are all worth sampling. Excellent service; the staff are friendly and attentive. The venue is roomy and airy, thanks in part to the high ceiling and mezzanine.,Order:· Luuma GLASS· Dungeness Crab Pavé· Chicken Liver Mousse· Monterey Squid· Mushroom Au Poivre· Pork Confit· Chocolate Mousse· Total before tip = $147.74Pros:· Five star customer service.  This place exemplifies the bar by which every service business should compare themselves.· Mousse was excellent as it should be, but the bread crisps that accompany it are lightly coated in a thin crispy syrup coating that creates the perfect flavor juxtaposition to the natural liver flavor.  Don't miss it.· The mushroom au poivre is a knockout with its perfectly well rounded, earthy flavor, in a light sauce. I would love a bowl of this over pasta - that would be an incredible dish.· The Pork Confit was perfectly cooked and had a thoughtful balance of flavors from the accoutrements, which you can tell when all eaten together, but...Cons:· I couldn't help but feel the flavor of the pork was a bit underwhelming. By itself, the pork just felt too ordinary for a place of this caliber. · I wanted to love the Crab Pave, but it too fell under the same category of the Pork - perfectly prepared, but a bit underwhelming in flavor, too much like something I've had many times before.  I think an additional touch of herb or lemon zest on the crab maybe, would elevate this to something brighter and more impactful.Comments:· I always want to reward incredible service, but the two cons drop it down a notch for me.,Located in Pacific Heights, you have to make a reservation ahead of time to dine here. The food is very shareable and its encouraged to share some of the snacks/vegetables/small plates/large plates. Their melon salad (honeydew, cantaloupe, pistachio pesto, olives etc) was so refreshing and delicious. I was not expecting it at all but that was probably my favorite dish. My friend and I also ordered their farro mushroom risotto and cauliflower dish. They paired very well with each other and I liked how the risotto wasn't too rich!,Routier had been on my radar for a while so we were excited to snag a Thursday evening reservation for 2. Recommend dining indoors because the space is so lovely. Cocktails were well balanced and tasty, recommend the gin.As for the food, we shared one of the ""Formule Routier"" prix fixe tastings consisting of salmon rilettes, duck leg confit, and creme brûlée and then ordered bread and butter, crab pave, fennel salad, and the mushroom and farro ""risotto"" a la carte.Everything was cooked perfectly and presented beautifully. Standouts were the duck leg and bread with buerre diablo for me. The crab pave was delicious though I found the potato slightly overshadowed the crab. The farro ""risotto"" was great but very earthy which my dining companion didn't care for. Pricy all in but great for a date night or special occasion.,Located on a street corner at the edge of pacific heights, Routier offers a great selection of french foods for dinner.Great is an understatement. Walking in, you're first greeted with a great ambiance. The interior is awesome, full of character and a bar that continually draws your eyes. Service is also fantastic. My water glass was never empty--the waitstaffs' attentiveness was awesome.We got the daily special (beef tartare), hen of the woods, crab pave, risotto, pork confit, & chocolate mousse.Beef Tartare - 4.5/5 fresh beef, onion, pâté highlights to complementCrab Pave - 5/5: six bite sized potato+ crab snacks. Super tasty!Hen of the woods - 5/5: mushrooms and egg yolk complement each other super well, the sauce is awesomeRisotto - 4/5 Creamy, rich, almost on the sweet side which was a welcome surprise, a solid risotto dish.(did not try the pork confit)Chocolate Mousse: 5/5: actually to die forTLDR: The only bad thing I can say about Routier is that it doesn't have a lunch service. I would highly recommend stopping by!,I stopped by Routier, an elegant French bistro. They serve moderately-priced and highly seasonal French fare from a stylish and inviting restaurant. I ordered the Nightingale cocktail - it had blended scotch, lemon and honey. It was so good I ended up skipping wine and sticking with cocktails. I tried the Dungeness crab pavé, Routier's signature entree. It consisted of crab served atop thinly sliced fried potatoes. It made for a delicious one-bite appetizer that was the perfect way to begin a meal. I wasn't too hungry so I just opted to also order the cauliflower soup and bread. The bread was solid, though the flavored butter it came with was a tad too cold and hard to be spread easily. The cauliflower soup was rather one-dimensional (very rich and low on flavor) and it came garnished with chickpeas, though they were undercooked and unpleasant. I finished with the chocolate moose and although the presentation was unremarkable, it made up for it with a great taste. Service was friendly and polished, as one would expect.,Love everything I've tried here... amazing cocktails... delicious food... a neighborhood gem.  Only wish it were in my neighborhood!  I've been back more than once and it's been totally worth the trek from the east bay... til the next time!,If you're in the mood for French food, this is the place to go. We were a party of 6 and was seated upstairs. Upstairs felt very cozy and intimate with the capacity seating of not more than 20. We each ordered the set menu which included an appetizer, main course and dessert. Two salads were added and shared among us. Let me tell you. My tummy was undeniably, extremely happy! If you want a happy tummy, take it to Routier. To make the culinary experience better, the customer service was outstanding!,Sat at the bar sine we didn't have a reservation on a Friday night and the restaurant was completely full. Service & food both fabulous. Will definitely go back again.,Amazing dinner, every dish we had we loved. We had so much fun with our friends tonight. Service was amazing. Favorites were the duck, corn risotto, liver mousse, but you really can't go wrong with anything you order. Can't wait to come back!,Great French restaurants with several interesting dishes on the menu! Luckily we were able to walk in and get a seat for two at the bar. It was quite difficult to decide what to order. We almost went with the three course prix fixe, but we weren't feeling especially hungry, so we decided to just have a nibble. I liked that there was also a good variety of vegetarian options.What we ended up ordering: - Beets with spiced tahini. Great starter salad, and quite filling! - Dungeness crab pave. Very fresh, and each bit sure was delectable, but not sure it was worth the price for 6 pieces. - Porcini and wild mushroom risotto. Very rich and flavorful. Maybe it's been a hot minute since I've eaten out in SF, but the prices here seemed pretty steep. Loved the interior decoration of the restaurant, which has right balance of modern yet classic and timeless. SF really needed more good French restaurants, and Routier is definitely a strong competitor!,We came across this restaurant as they were listed in the Michelin guide's Bib Gourmand picks - even though we didn't partake for the prix fixe, I have to say some of these dishes were pretty awesome.Here were the highlights, roughly in order of my liking:+ Heirloom tomatoes w/ crispy bread: this was fantastic. Tomatoes are in season right now and this salad really shows you what quality ingredients can do for a dish. Some tomatoes were literally creamy as goat cheese.+ Sweet corn risotto: get this to share with 2-3 people. It's fantastic. I wouldn't necessarily recommend eating it by oneself. The corn is fantastic, but that means its natural sweetness pushes the dish toward the opposite end of the savory-sweet scale.+ Squid with beurre diable: this dish is pecestarian friendly, which is a shock considering how awesome the sauce is. It tasted like there was smoky bacon bits tossed in.+ Dungeness crab pave: lots of reviews raved about this - it was solid. Generous crab and super crispy potato.The halibut with corn was just OK for me. The fish wasn't anything special and underseasoned. It goes well with the corn, but the risotto is a much better corn dish.Definitely coming back in the future!,In retrospect probably more a 3.5 but rounding up for the desserts. This is one restaurant where you have to leave room for dessert. The food here I would describe as bistro food with a California flair - it's rich and not super fussy, but it does seem to highlight seasonal produce. I tried: Dungeness crab pave, spiced mayonnaise - I had to get these because they're so acclaimed but tbh I don't get the hype. Yes they're tasty bites and the crispy potato is excellent but it's crab and potato at the end of the day. Good but I probably wouldn't get this the next time I come back.Hen of the woods mushrooms ""au poivre"", egg yolk, crushed potato - This was very tasty, loved the richness from the egg yolk. Beets with blood orange and red onion, black olive caramel with yuzu - I found these too sweet, didn't end up finishing the dish. Dark chocolate mousse - This was excellent, the coffee crumble added a unique texture and bitterness against the mousse.Semifreddo - Another delicious creamy dessert.,Enjoyed a delicious celebration dinner in the private mezzanine. The courses were beautifully presented and well timed. Service was very good but the food was the real star!  Looking forward to our next visit!,Poorly run establishment that seemed to disregard its patrons. The waiters were not organized and were disorganized. I ordered the halibut with a pesto sauce (?) and cauliflower. The menu did NOT state that it included spinach. It should have stated otherwise since I'm allergic to it. The fish was overcooked. The lamb shoulder was more of a Bolognese stew. Over sauced. The waiters kept walking by and did not check up to see how I was doing, even though Routier wasn't busy. When I asked to see the desert menu, or for more water, they made it seem like it was an issue. Lack of service is a major disappointment. I don't see how others got a 4/5 star experience here. Won't be going back. No decent service, No customers!!,Eminently   shareable plates. Would encourage  diners to try a large variety. 3 of us ate the crab in potato, the bread with spread,fresh tuna with tomatoes and zucchini,the most wonderful risotto with corn with hazelnuts,perfect halibut,hen of the woods, was worried about egg yolk, but not an issue.. my daughter's shared vanilla napoleon with berries. Would recommend the champagne, Guy de Forez Brut and the Rose' deLoire. Great service, convivial atmosphere. Overall a perfect evening.',Special double date night! Come with your vaccine card and fancy shoes. Such a lovely evening. We came with another couple after it popped up on the Michelin Star list. Wonderful service, great food, and it didn't kill my wallet ($100/person). Highly recommend. Our favorites were the tomato appetizer, corn risotto and lamb shoulder.,Beautiful space with very friendly staff. Easily made reservations via Tock, but there is a $10 fee per person. Cozy first floor with tables and a bar area. There is space on the 2nd floor as well which is accessible via stairs or an elevator. Covid vaccination cards checked upon arrival. Dishes ordered: Crispy Monterey Squid with beurre diable, pickled chilesFarro and Mushroom ""risotto"" with pecorino, brussel sprouts leaves and baconRoasted Halibut, buttered corn and summer beans, chili oil and dillCrispy lamb shoulder, summer squash, sugar snap peas and marinated Nardello peppers with fresh herbsDungeness crab paveWe enjoyed all of the dishes, but felt the lamb was slightly dry. Staff was super friendly and service was great. Would definitely recommend and would return in the future.,We all need to root for the continued prosperity of Routier! Located in the upscale Lower Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco on the corner of California and Divisadero Streets, Routier is a new restaurant, of which some owners come from the team that created the b. patisserie French bakery that happens to be lo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ated a few doors down. The restaurant took two full years to be completed, and of course when they were ready to open, we just happened to be in the middle of the pandemic, where indoor space has been all but nonexistent. Thankfully, their team didn't give up and they put a pause on everything, but over summer of last year," they strived and finally succeeded in realizing their dream of opening a modern French bistro. """"Routier"""" refers to a roadside restaurant in French and they have delivered on their goal of specializing in quality savory French food at a decent price point. My friend actually tried Routier for a takeout holiday dinner this past year during our lockdown and couldn't stop raving about it", so when it became time to try something new and realizing that after all these months, we were still stuck indoors and that takeout was the new thing to do, the suggestion of trying Routier for dinner was a no-brainer.The best thing about the menu at Routier is that they have a three course menu, which they call their Formule Routier that is intended for one person. With this three-course meal, it is apparently a seasonal menu, changing every few months or so, what sold me on this menu option is that they had one of their most popular dishes as the main entrée, the Roasted Halibut which was a California halibut, served with cauliflower topped with green garlic, peas and almond pesto. When my friend told me that this was an option, I was sold. To start our three-course meal, we received a pork rillette, served with a separate side salad made of bitter greens and served with miniature pickles. And for the dessert course we were served Strawberries and cream topped with crumbled almonds. Online ordering and pickup was super easy. As this three course meal was super affordable at only 45 dollars a person, which made our wallets happy on top of our taste buds.I will give the pork rillettes credit for being a creamy filling version of the traditional pate. It was an acquired taste for sure, and not everyone agreed if they liked this as our starter, but thankfully the tartness of the pickles and a small arugula salad that accompanied the rillettes really balanced the dish out overall. We weren't expecting a nice small Fennel Salad with sliced Granny Smith apples, dates, feta and marcona almonds topped with a curry vinaigrette to serve as a sort of bridge between our first two courses, but we gladly shared this small dish that cleansed our palettes. But the halibut was the real star of our meal, creamy and cooked just perfectly and the bed of mashed cauliflower only served to enhance the flavor of our dish with every bite. I wasn't expecting too much out of our Strawberries and Cream dessert, but I was pleasantly surprised as it was a deceptively simple looking dessert, but tasted flawlessly, as it wasn't a too heavy way to end our meal. Would a return visit be in order for Routier? It's a resounding yes, if only to try more of their nourishing family meals, plus to check out their snazzy newly remodeled main dining room, which was once a jazz club and was previously home to the tavern Wild Hare. I am so excited that people behind the scenes of b. patisserie realized their goal of bringing quality yet affordable French cuisine to the masses, they may have a long road ahead of them, but with food prepared so lovingly as it was here, even in takeout form, this road may be paved with success!,Went for a birthday dinner a few weeks ago, and had an overall great experience. Sort of elevated, cozy French bistro vibes with super seasonal food. Our server was very friendly and helpful when deciding what to order. Went with a group of 4, and we did family style, ordering the dungeness crab pave, fennel salad, sweet corn risotto, and the dark chocolate mousse. Would definitely not skip the dungeness crab pave - it is so rich and indulgent without being over the top (its bite-sizeness is key), and is not something I've seen really at other places. The sweet corn risotto was also delicious, especially considering it was the peak of corn season. Dark chocolate mousse is great for people who really love coffee flavor, as we all did. In general, just very solidly executed food and nice ambiance.,This place is brilliant. The service was world class. Great wine and food options. I had the tasting menu with the duck rillettes, salmon, and berry tart. Also had pea soup, Dungeness crab, heirloom tomato salad, and the beef large plate. We also ordered the triple chocolate cheesecake. The star of the show was the beef. All the dessert comes from the bakery next door. You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu! This was the perfect date spot.,Food was amazing! A nice French brasserie feel. Most dishes were shareable.A++ - chicken liver mousse / so creamy and smooth bursting with rich flavors. So good, I had to order one to goB - duck rillets - I feel like I had enough of this in France so I'm like meh. Compared to the mousse, this had a more grimy texture, a little more on the dry end with thicker chunksA- :  crab toastini - would've been better without the dillA : fruit salad - interesting take with large chicks of fruits and a mild green pesto looking dressing, very refreshingOverall I lived it and would definitely come back,Opening a new restaurant in the middle of a pandemic is a real act of courage and I've been wanting to give this restaurant a try for a couple of weeks now.  This is a savory restaurant from the same team as B Patisserie next door.  I ordered the Formule Routier, which is their affordable prix fixe menu.At $39, this is a great value and the meal included green bean salad, crispy lamb shoulder with farro and broccoli and roasted peach with almond cake.  This meal is the definition of comfort food for me and the lamb shoulder was just outstanding.  Coming from the same team as B, the expectations for dessert is quite high and this roasted peach/blackberry almond cake definitely cleared the bar.  The restaurant itself is a bit anachronistic but they had a nice waiting area for people waiting for their take-out. Highly recommended and I'm definitely coming back.,Routier is the beautiful new French bistro from famed chef and baker Belinda Leong of b.patisserie.  It is located on the corner of Divisadero and California in Pacific Heights. Even though it is on a busy corner, as soon as you walk into the restaurant you are transported to and the emerald green colored banquets and ceiling, warm wood tones, and gold accents creates a polish and intimate mood that precedes an even more sumptuous meal. We ordered the Grandalla cocktail with gin, green chartreuse, lemon and Cava as well as a Corpe's Reviver #2 to start our meal.  Drinks were perfectly balanced and delicious. For dinner,"  one of us opted to do the pre-fixe """"Formule Routier"""" 3 course menu and we also added one more appetizer and one more entree.For appetizers", our a la carte dish was the Monterrey squid bit beurre diablo, pickled chilis," and lemon.  They squid was light panko crusted which gave it a beautiful crunch which paired well with the luscious beurre diablo.  For the """"Formule Routier"""" appetizer", we had a chilled pea soup with goat cheese, herbs and crisped chorizo.  Both appetizers complemented each other and we decided to order a bottle of rose to go with our meal. We had the Queen of the Sierra rose of  Zinfandel, Grenach noir, and Tempranillo. The nose was intoxicating with beautiful jasmine and rose on the nose. We also got watermelon and strawberry on the palate and it had a long saline finish.    For our main courses we ordered the crispy lamb shoulder with caramelized sunchokes, sugar snap peas," ramps and fresh herbs and had the pan seared  salmon with tender greens over pureed carrots and a curry butter sauce as part of our """"Formule Routier '' tasting.  Both dishes were delicious but the salmon was a standout.  The natural sweetness of the carrots paired exceptionally well with rich yellow curry sauce.  To end our meal", we had strawberries and cream wite sesame ice cream with crushed pistachios.  It was light yet packed with a lot of flavor.  Service was great and we were guided through our meal with a great pace.  Routier will be a great addition to the San Francisco dining scene and we can't wait to go back.,JP Carmona (chef) creates heaven on earth for the palate I was blown away by the tasting menu he created to celebrate my promotion after a request from my partnerHe created 16 beautiful pieces and each course was paired with a glass of wine that perfectly paired with the flavor profile of the courseI was in food heaven for 2 hours and couldn't recommend them enoughThe star of the show for me was:The crab and caviar Pavè's - so Crisp on the outside and soft and pillowy on the insideThe chicken liver mousse with currants and onions was also - pure delightI could have left after the appetizers and been absolutely satisfied with the dinner Thank you JP You're doing amazing work and I can't wait to bring more family and friends for celebration,COVID-19 TAKEOUTI'm a loner at work. During lunch, while people gather at the communal tables to eat or go to wellness workshops (pre-covid)," I hide out in my paper fortress eating my sad desk lunch. One day in late February 2020:Boss: """"Guess who I got to come for a cooking demo in April?""""Me: """"Gordon Ramsay?"""" (Because who doesn't like to get ripped a new bunghole.)Boss: """"Ummm"," no...Belinda Leong!""""Me: """"Omg"," THEEE Queen of KAs!!!""""(Silently screams while doing the running man.)If anyone is going to get me out of a rut at lunch", it's going to be Belinda Leong!Then, COVID hit...whomp. Well, if Belinda Leong can't come to you, you go to her and support her newest venture: Routier and fangirl her from 6+ feet away!Opening this weekend, Routier is Belinda's new French-American restaurant with an Alinea and Manresa alum helming the kitchen. They're open for takeout only. Order through their website and choose a pick-up time. Pickup was smooth with COVID safety precautions taken - contactless ordering/payment and all staff wore masks properly. Tell them your name at the entrance and someone will grab your order and hand it to you. Utensils are by request only.First and foremost," I appreciated the clean and thoughtful plating for """"takeout"""" and that no knife was needed", making it easy to enjoy if you're having a picnic or even eating it in your car. Second, for SF standards, the pricing was affordable coming from fine dining veterans and for the top-notch quality. For $82 before tip, we were both full and had leftovers. I ordered the following (shared among 2 people):* Pork Rillettes w/ apple-mustard condiment ($12): bit.ly/342NgRWThe slow roasted pork shoulder was perfectly spreadable (think a rich, fancy french pulled pork) and well-balanced by the tangy apple-mustard and crunchy cornichon.With the accompanying demi baguette, it's a nice app for two or a light meal for one. * Braised Lamb Shoulder w/ farro, preserved lemon, broccoli ($25): bit.ly/31Uxgi8Braised, sliced, then seared, the lamb shoulder was uber tender and flavorful. I enjoyed the crisp, caramelized edges. The farro was nicely chewy and the broccoli crisp.  * Formule Routier, 3-course prix fixe meal ($39): bit.ly/2Y5DTgx--Beet & Strawberry Salad w/ quinoa, shallot dressingMy least favorite dish but only because I don't like quinoa (yes, I'm a weirdo) but I really enjoyed the roasted beets. --Caramelized Brisket w/ potato pavé, creamed kale The brisket was meltingly tender and the caramelized fat cap added that extra layer of beefy richness. Despite being takeout, the potato pavé (think fancy scalloped potatoes) still had a crispy exterior. I also ordered an additional side for $7. The creamed kale was a nice modern twist to the classic creamed spinach. Between the two meat entrees, this was the standout. --Chocolate Mousse w/ chantilly, coffee crumble Amazing and my favorite part of the meal....and I'm not a dessert, nor chocolate person. The mousse was incredibly smooth, rich, and intensely chocolately without being too heavy. The airy chantilly cream perfectly cut through sweet bitterness of the dark chocolate and the crumbles added a great crunchy texture contrast. Service was excellent and you can see the smiles through the staff's masks. I arrived earlier than the 5:30 pm pick-up time (1st time-slot) and was greeted by Belinda herself. She was very appreciative of the support and I got to chat with her for a bit. She suggested that I warm up the entrees before eating. I told her that I was having a picnic at The Embarcadero so didn't have access to heating device. She said, it was fine to eat as is but on the drive there, I could smell the beefy aromas wafting from my back seat. They were kind enough to warm up my food. A kind, unexpected gesture that was much appreciated, thank you!Parking can be challenging as there were a lot of people out and about so you may want to give yourself extra time to find parking. Overall, Routier's solid casual French fare is such a welcome addition to the SF food scene. It's only day two and I know it's going to be a while but I'm excited to see what's in store when it's safe to dine in again.,Cute spot, good vibe, nice music and good food / wine. Enjoying the Cremant $16/glass champagne,Opening Day!!  Woot Woot! Tired of reading about restaurant closures everywhere?  Well, I'm super excited to share a truly hot restaurant OPENING!  This place has been in the works for over a year and finally...I'm a HUGE fan of Belinda Leong's well-known French bakery, b. Patisserie.  Everyone in the San Francisco Bay Area who knows pastries knows that b. Patisserie literally RULES when it comes the kouign amann!!  It's the BEST I've personally had in the US and even outshines many places in Europe.  I try kouign amanns all over, but I stopped recently because it never beats b. Patisserie's.  Believe me, like all the other massive followers of her French bakery, I too have been anxiously awaiting the opening of her new French restaurant, opened along with her two well-known​ partners.  ***3-Course Formule Routier ($39.00)***    - Beet Salad:  All very fresh ingredients    - Caramelized Brisket:  Very flavorful with a nice balance of meat and fat.  The potato pave with nicely thin layered potatoes was​ also very good and the crispiness of the top layer held up well.  Just don't nuke this or you'll lose​ the crispiness.    - Chocolate Mousse:  This is a MUST!  Simple, but great velvety smooth chocolate that packs a nice chocolatey​ punch.  And the chocolate​ crumbles were a perfect addition.  So good I think I'll get an extra a la carte ($11.00) next time.  Service was very friendly and the pick-up process was seamless.  I feel good about spending my hard-earned money patronizing businesses that actually appreciate my business.  This is one of these places.I can't wait to dine inside this nice space one day for a full experience.  Currently,​ only open Friday-Sunday.  Order and pre-pay online​.I enjoyed my meal, especially the chocolate mousse.  That said, I'm not sure if brisket is the very best choice for takeout, but it was very flavorful.  Also, for $39.00, it was on the pricier end for the portion size of the brisket.  I'm looking forward to trying more things," like a lobster that serves 2 for $45.00. ..something for my next visit.  And don't forget that awesome addicting chocolate mousse!!Pro Tip: 1.  Belinda Leong """"owns"""" the triangle on California & Divisadero Streets with b. Patisserie", B. on the Go and now Routier, all within a minute walk of each other.  2.  Did you know Belinda Leong & her partner was awarded the James Beard Award for Outstanding Baker (2018)?  You can't go wrong with any of their desserts!,The best meal I have eaten in restaurant in long time! The service was excellent thanks Declan always making sure the water and wine glasses were always full. Every dish we ordered had a variety of flavors and unique ingredients! We shared several dishes among 4 people and everyone at the table left full! We will definitely be returning again to enjoy our favorite dishes and to see new additions to the menu!,Absolutely in love, going to be my new go-to french restaurant!! Pea soup: cold pea soup had good balance, creamy yet sweet with some goat cheese adding to the balance as well some crunch for texture. Dungeness crab pave: I could have 2 orders of these by myself. Potatoes are super super crispy outside and thinly layered inside. Crab was also seasoned well. Def need some wine with it Chicken liver mousse: I love chicken liver mousse in general and what I really liked about this one is how not overly salted it was. The caramelized onion added the necessary flavor and the crisped up bread went well with itJumbo asparagus: beautiful presentation and nice use of trout roe but i think the sauce could be toned down a bit? And asparagus cooked a little less, but personal preference California halibut: tasty pesto, perfectly cooked halibut and sautéed spinach, all went really well together, a good light main to have Finally, dessert... got chocolate hazelnut crunch cake  which was divine. Same owner as b patisserie bakery so all of their desserts must be good, excited to come back and try the other ones too :D Atmosphere wise it would be an amazing date night restaurant, but unpretentious vibe so a casual friend gathering would work too! Def going to try out more wine next time.,Highly recommend Routier.  Everything we ordered was consistently delicious and I plan to return to explore the rest of the menu.  The wild boar peppercorn pate and the hen of the woods mushrooms au poivre were the stars of appetizers.  The cod with lobster sauce was absolutely divine, but the braised lamb shank, pork confit, short rib confit and the farro risotto with bacon were all delicious.  Make sure you save room for dessert because the spiced cake with poached pears and Chantilly cream was the perfect finish.  The staff was outstanding and had great recommendations on both dishes and wine pairings.,Came here for a birthday dinner and Routier did not disappoint. The waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable about the gluten-free options. We didn't feel limited at all by the choices and they even offered to swap out multigrain crackers for gluten-free ones, which was an appreciated touch.The Chicken liver pate appetizer was rich and beautifully plated. Not my cup of tea but the rest of my party enjoyed it. The hen of the woods mushrooms were also nice and a great texture but could have used a bit more salt or seasoning to bring out the flavors as my preference. The marinated tuna was amazing. It was beautiful and had so much interesting texture with the cucumbers. The short rib confit was juicy and tender. The light strawberry and peach fool was just right after a robust dinner.Another Yelp review recommended the Mocktail, but it must have been from another season because this one was an underwhelming fizzy tonic with very little flavoring and a sprig of rosemary.Overall, the service was incredible. Very patient and attentive. The pacing was also super impressive, seemingly every plate was ready after another, and served at the perfect temperature too. Great place for a memorable, low-key celebration.,We made a reservation for Saturday night and were excited to try this French bistro-style restaurant. Unfortunately, we had to eat our dinner in our coats instead of comfortably in our dinner attire because it was so cold in there. They keep windows open and when I asked to close them as the freezing air was blowing on me, they said they had to keep them open due to the cities' Covid regulations.  I looked those up sf.gov and there is no requirement, only a suggestion and it's up to the restaurant to interpret this.  So they are choosing to freeze the customers which are sure to get colds and just, in general, be uncomfortable during a $200 dinner.  How about you invest in HEPPA filters instead? I have zero patience at this point for Covid theatre.  I'm choosing to dine indoors and want indoor temperatures.  I want to support businesses that are looking to get back to normal. These measures might make people feel good but they are ineffective and at this point unnecessary. Too bad because the food is quite good, the service was nice and professional and if this place was nice and warm, it would be a lovely date spot that I would love to come back to. We started with the crab pave, which I thought was lovely, although the crab might have been too mild for this dish, and could easily be switched up for another protein.  We had the beet salad, which was well balanced, had nice acid and sweetness, and was just a great way to break up some of the richer dishes.The hen of the woods mushroom dish was also a great, richer, very French countryside type of dish.For the entrees, we had the short rib and the lamb, both were very well executed, with great sides and portion size.  Overall we were very happy with the food. For drinks I had the martini to start and a glass of wine grenache with my meal, my husband got a beer.  We opted to go to a nice spot on Spruce, I'm sure you can guess which one, and have dessert and cocktails there in the warmth of their bar and restaurant with nice indoor temperatures.,Since Belinda Leong and Michel Suas have long been regarded as the undisputed rulers of the Bay Area pastry world, their first excursion into the characteristic sit-down dining is no surprise. JP Carmona, who was once the chef de cuisine at Manresa, was brought on board to run the kitchen as a way to make things even more appealing. As a consequence, a warm and inviting neighborhood place has been created that serves French bistro food with a very Californian twist. A casual approach masks culinary mastery in dishes such as a hot-and-cold composition of crisp, buttery potato pavé topped with sweet Dungeness crab in a herby, lemony mayonnaise. In addition, spectacular seasonal food and daring tastes are characteristics throughout the year; thus, it should go without saying that you should spare space for dessert.,This. Place. Is. Fantastic.   Best French restaurant I've been to in YEARS. Fiancé and I had the duck confit, corn risotto and something yummy for dessert. All of it was impeccable. Super nice people, too.,FOOD:Dungeness crab pave was tasty. Albeit, the dungeness crab pave, the farro/mushroom risotto, and the rock fish  slightly over salted. The corn risotto was sweet and had great flavor but was a little undercooked, while the farro/mushroom risotto was soggier and overcooked. The pork shoulder had a Shanghai influence with its braised vegetables. The flavor was good but it was burnt. The crispy lamb shoulder was not crispy and quite gamy, but tender. The cold beet soup was interesting with it's sour, sweet, and irony flavor.SERVICE:To begin with, the malehost at the door who greeted me was extremely rude in his manner. Hementioned that we were 15 mintues late and that we would have to beout by 7:30. The lady who booked the reservation assured me it wouldbe okay to arrive at 5:45pm since I was asking for a 6:00pmreservation, and that she would make a note of it. She also mentionedit would be alright if we were not sure if we would have 3 or 4people. Yet, the bald man cut me off and ignored my explanation, witha very unpleasant expression. Then after our dinner, the same man cameover to get the check and made us all feel very uncomfortable on mymother's birthday, standing there waiting for us to slide our card,pay the tip, and leave. If I had known we would be treated this way, Iwould not have come at all, but since the female was very nice and assured me it would be fine over the phone, I took the plunge.After all this, finding that he added a $10 balance onto my tockaccount by changing the reservation after the fact, has put anextremely bad taste in my mouth. Either you don't let us dine or youtreat us well. Either you add the extra $10 during the dinner or notat all. But please do not seat us, take our money, then treat usbadly. This is really the worst dinning experience we all had in along time. And it was on my mother's birthday.I contacted the owner and chef about the issue and was told that I must have been mistaken and that I misjudged the expressions since the bald greeter was wearing a mask. As a minority immigrant, I'm used to racism and can really tell when someone has ill feeling against you, mask or no mask. Nevertheless, the lady who greeted us and the waiter were both very welcoming. Somehow I could tell even with their masks on. EDIT 10/7/21: The owner made no effort to fix the issue or offer any consolation. Instead, this review was removed from yelp because he claimed it somehow violated yelp policies regarding racism and cultural bias. Now that the review is back up, you can view the unedited review above and decide for yourself if that's true. BIASED REVIEWS: It is also worth mentioning that the 4.5 star rating is likely inflated since the owner attempts to get all the negative reviews removed by claiming they violate yelp policy. Personally, I think it would probably be more effective to just treat your customers better, improving service, and offering ways to mitigate the problem. Instead, the owner redirected blame and find alternative ways to boost rating. Take a look at the other low reviews when you sort by low rating. You will see that there is a consensus about the reality of the food, price, and service.,New favorite SF restaurant right now. Dungeness crab pave, delicious morsels to kick off your food adventure. Also opted in on the chicken liver mousse. Nice healthy portion, very rich and almost decadent. Only thing I wanted more of were the crisps. Crispy Monterey squid was one of the top highlights. That, sauce. If I could have a side of that to accompany anything I would take it in a heartbeat. It took my whole being not to lick the bowl. Hen of the wood mushrooms were so meaty and packed with all the umami goodness; definitely a must try too. As far as I've read and noted, any and all of the risottos are bomb. By this point in time I was hitting a wall and definitely needed to save room for desserts. In my opinion, it's a safe bet to get one of each. I mean it's Belinda from B patisserie, what could go wrong?! It was the perfect ending to a fantastic meal. Also service was definitely top notch! Will be back again and again AND again!,Had an early birthday dinner here and I had really high hopes. Was hoping for a more inviting and fun place since it's called Routier, which literally is a diner. What I found instead was restaurant that can't seem to make up its mind on being new Californian or classic French bistro. The interior was moody dark blue and white led lights, the fare... well let's just say it wasn't that interesting. The Dungeness crab pave was very dill forward to put it mildly, and there were exactly six tiny puffed potatoes with an even smaller dollop of crab. The crispy squid was ok, but felt like it was an alt version of a lackluster calamari that lacked acid tossed in some torn kale leaves. The entrees, the risotto was ok, the grains were not mushy but it was just not that creamy huggable dish you come to expect. Instead, it felt like a savory fancy cooked steel cut oats w toppings. The duck confit looked amazing but the duck meat itself was dry and stringy, which is odd since confit means usually it's braised in fat, how do you get that to turn dry and stringy is beyond me. Unless it sat there for a long while out and dried up. Lastly, the chocolate mousse. I picked it because I was expecting an indulgent dark chocolate ganache like experience but instead I got a super light fluffy mousse that reminded me of something you can get from a pudding cup. Service was ok and attentive, wine selection was very good and reasonable. Food quality was good but the whole poor cooking and confusing personality of what it really wanted to be makes this whole place very underwhelming and by extension overpriced. The same folks own the sandwich shop and patisserie next door, which are excellent. So perhaps stick to that instead. For awesome Californian cuisine and intimate French bistro classics the city has much better and abundant choices and possibly even at comparable or lower prices. With so many alternatives, this is going to be a hard pass for us. Happy dining,Last Saturday, we had dinner here.I liked the vibe, and it appears that the staff has been there for a long time as well. The tables are very close together.The wine list is extensive. Several are also available by the glass. We ordered a small plate of the Roasted Hen. Very tasty and filling. Crispy lamb and pork shoulder confit were also on the menu. The lamb was excellent, with consistent cooking throughout. Pork is a substantial portion. I was going to order sweet corn risotto, but it was too pricey.For dessert, we had dark chocolate mousse and strawberry cheesecake.I would have liked to be wowed a little more for the price, but it was a solid four-star experience overall.,There was a lot of hype for this place, and there are a lot of great things about it, but also some mediocre things as well. GOOD- our waiter!! Alejandro was awesome. He was so well mannered and educated about the menu. He explained everything so well, and gave great recommendations. He knew how/when to chat with us without being all-encompassing. - my crispy lamb shoulder was absolutely delicious!! - all staff was sooo nice, it made the night amazing! - lots of yummy sounding things on the menu makes me want to come back! Seems like a very seasonal Restuarant, which means an ever changing menu which is great!! NOT SO GOOD- we felt our food was yummy, but not amazing. We aren't food critics, and honestly I'd still absolutely go back to this place. My vegetables were undercooked to my liking, but my lamb was sooo yummy so I didn't mind so much. We felt that the side dishes didn't totally make sense with the main dishes. I would have loved to have polenta or a more substantial side with my lamb, but they probably did that to keep it light!! - Halibut was under seasoned and lacked flavor. The corn/side dish carried the flavor- corkage fee is $45!!!!!!!!!! Enough said.,Excellent. Food was delicious, atmosphere was casual but nice, service was really good. Can't wait to go back!,More than a neighborhood gem, it's a destination for anyone seeking an amazing meal, wonderful service, in a classy yet casual atmosphere.  From the moment we stepped in with friendly greetings and smiles, we were enamored by bright comfortable interior...enjoying our experience even before food and drink was served and continued throughout the evening.We started with some tasty well balanced cocktails, just boozy enough, not overly sweet, a perfect start to dinner.  Followed by a couple small plates, salmon rilletes to spread on perfectly grilled toast, garnished with a variety of spring vegetables.  Then dungeness crab pave, thinly sliced layered potato topped with crab and spiced mayo, amazing.For entrée we shared the pork shoulder confit which was so good.  A bit crispy on the outside, fork tender inside with a wonderful jus & veggies complimenting.  Also got the sweet corn risotto, a perfect contrast to the pork, light perfectly cooked rice and tasty corn sauce.We can't wait to return as there were many other things we wanted to try.We love places like this where for a couple hours are transported away to a quaint French bistro, with amazing food on par with any fine dining restaurant, without the pretense, just comfort and satisfaction.,My new favorite spot in Lower Pac Height. Stellar food, great selection of cocktails and wine, incredible dessert, and very friendly staff. I love the bar seats and there's an intimate upstairs area as well. I've been there 3 times and each time the menu has been a bit different. The atmosphere is always lovely with a French brasserie/ salon type of vibe.,Delicious food, nice ambiance, cute dinnerware and super friendly staff. IMO, the menu is French with a fusion twist. I've made three visits in three months. .,Belinda Leong can do no wrong. This fantastic spinout from b patisserie/b on the go team always delivers (figuratively; they do offer pickup though which we use most often). I am a huge fan of the formule routier (starter, main, dessert) for a reasonable price point and we often come down with a craving for the delectable chicken liver mousse. I could seriously eat a whole bowl to myself.The menu often features a lamb shoulder main, which is presented beautifully and has amazing texture and seasoning. I have also enjoyed the short rib," """"risotto", and the seasonal soups/salads.Dining in is elegant and easygoing. Service is friendly, attentive, but not overbearing. The cocktails are balanced, the wine list offers something for every palate. I'm pleased as punch to live within a couple of blocks of Routier.,If you want to get ripped off with tiny expensive portions and an obnoxious waiter this is the place for you. Went once and it was bad. Gave it a second try and it was worse. We didn't even get to the main dining room despite long standing reservations. No they seated us in a tiny second floor room which had all the charm of a graveyard. BTW I live in Paris, here on business.,The chef here is MAGIC. All the food was so delicious we ended up having the bread (a must...cause devil butter), lobster risotto, jumbo asparagus, the crab pave, and the crispy lamb. None of it disappoints and I cannot wait to come again. The welcoming ambiance and kind staff makes this a place I cannot wait to become a regular at! Will be back ASAP,I had been looking forward to visiting Routier since first hearing of this new collaboration between Belinda Leong and Michel Suas. Last night, my boyfriend and I finally made it there for dinner. Even with all my anticipation, I had no idea what a treat was in store for us. The space is reminiscent of a French brasserie, but colorful, airy, and decorated so tastefully, especially with the bouquets of fresh flowers at each table. The hostess and waiters were genuinely welcoming -- warm, attentive, and kind. It feels like the kind of place I would want to come back to, just for the pleasure of the atmosphere and graciousness of the people. We started by sharing the salmon rillettes, heirloom tomatoes with tonnato sauce, and crab pavé. Each dish was perfectly seasoned, balanced, delicious. The potato pavés were crispy and decadent mouthfuls -- a perfect pairing with the delicate crab. The salmon rillettes were perfectly smooth and paired with avocado cream, pickled vegetables, and greens. The heirloom tomato dish was an unexpected delight -- every tomato perfectly ripe and flavorful, and complemented by the richness of the tonnato. I've had tonnato sauces before that were overly fishy or not well emulsified. This one sang. For main dishes we had the halibut with buttered corn and beans, and lobster grandi aioli. In both cases, the fish/shellfish was on point, and paired with accompaniments. The miso aioli with the lobster was especially delicious.  I was close to requesting a small container of it to take home. Dessert, given the partnership with B. Patisserie, was sure to be lovely and it was. We had the triple chocolate cheesecake and berry tart. Both were just right for the end of the meal -- decadent, but ethereal, with so many layers of flavor and texture. Looking around, it was clear how many other tables were enjoying the ease and good hospitality of Routier. The staff were universally kind and attentive, and even  opened the door for us on saying goodnight. It was a welcome break from the often overly obsequious or overwhelming pace (and noise level) of places here.This is a restaurant that makes me happy to live in San Francisco (if I can't be in France) and I look forward to coming back as soon as possible. Bravo, Routier. Je vous remercie.,"We came as a group of 4 on a Friday night at 6 pm with a reservation. It's not full at all. The decor is very Frenchy and service is excellent!We ordered 1. crab pave 4/52. chicken liver mousse (a bit too sweet) 3.5/53. short rib confit 3.5/54. Farro and mushroom risotto 5/55. hen of the woods mushrooms """"au poivre"""" 5/56. chocolate mousse 5/57.  Napoleon cake 5/5For cocktail", we got mason jolie and martinque, they were alright.Total was $274 for 4 people.Will come back again!,Lovely Sunday night meal. Have been wanting to try for a long time and so glad I finally did. For the three of us, we got crab pave, chicken liver mousse, pea soup, fried Monterey squid, lobster, halibut and mushroom farro risotto. Desserts were the delectable chocolate mousse cake and the buttery, warm financiers. I really enjoyed the pave, which had the perfect crispy warm potatoes; the fried squid, which had a perfect bite with the sauce, and the umami ladened mushroom farro risotto. Pea soup had a bit too much tarragon and while I enjoyed the chicken liver mousse, I find myself comparing it to the version at Ritch Table, which I like better (maybe because at RT, they serve it with softer bread instead of the crispier toasts here.) The lobster dish was delightfully refreshing with a mix of super fresh and colorful cooked/ raw veggies. Definitely a feast for the senses! Service was attentive and friendly, with many changes of plates and cutlery between courses. Will definitely be back. An absolute gem!,Amazing service.  Extremely good food. Great ambiance.The dungeonus crab pave was extremely good.  The farro risotto was amazing. Chocolate mousse for dessert was extremely good and paired with their selection of port, extremely well.,We were so happy with the dine-in opportunity over Easter weekend. What a lovely experience - the food, the staff and the vibe. All were excellent. A photo of the spectacular spring-green soup is uploaded. We will be back soon!,Everything was amazing and full of flavor! The staff were very attentive and the ambience takes me back to Paris. My favorite part was dessert - everything on the dessert menu sounded amazing so we ordered all of it (except the blue cheese one),Blown away by this spot. It's one of those places where," after the first couple dishes you know you're in good hands. I love """"small plate"""" places because it gives you a chance to try a lot of different flavors", so this menu is right up my alley. We ordered about 8 plates, including dessert, and everything was incredible; super fresh ingredients made to order with explosively bright flavors. Small cocktail menu, but the ones we ordered we great; balanced flavors and not overly-boozy.Must-haves:- Dungeness crab pavé- Chicken liver mousse- Melon pesto salad- Strawberry tart,We had the best meal we've had in a long time. Wonderful variety of flavors, great cocktails, truly exceptional service. The waitstaff are incredibly attentive. The hen of the woods mushroom dish was a favorite. Would have liked a slightly longer dessert menu but overall, a wonderful place to fine. We will return soon!,Absolutely delicious food! Every single dish was fabulous and left me marveling at how it was created and I immediately wanted to return. Lovely ambiance and staff as well. A++,Came here for a fancy dinner with my best friend this past weekend. My friend was super jazzed as apparently the restaurant is owned by the people who own B Patisserie, which she goes to pretty We were able to grab an 830 reservation, which went nicely with the restaurant vibe as it was still pretty packed when we arrived. The space is really beautiful and looks like a French bistro, beautiful bar in bar, high ceilings and great lighting. We were seated upstairs, which was honestly really lovely as it was a bit quieter and less crowded. We went a little while orders but decided to get the chicken liver pate, the fried squid, and the bread with deviled butter for apps and then split the the farro 'risotto' and the sole in lobster sauce for mains. We also each ordered a gin cocktail that came with cardamon bitters. The appetizers were honestly amazing - the squid was fried perfectly and served in a really nice and unique sauce, and the chicken liver was SO GOOD. The onions, the sweet jam, the crackers it all just came together beautifully. I was a bit sad to not get the crab pave, but will definitely get it next time. The mains I thought were actually just okay - nothing wrong, super well cooked, but I was expecting some more flavor pop for both. They were both very unique and I can say I haven't really had something similar, which was nice. We ended up ordering 2 desserts to share that we mostly took home - a coconut moose and some kind of very chocolately cake. They were absolutely excellent, although we ended up bringing most of them home as we were stuffed from everything else.The service here was 10/10 - our waiter was so nice, so patient and so helpful! Really helped make this a truly lovely experience :),One hidden gem! Great food and great price. Nice staff. You will likely need to make aReservation prior to going.,Savory French food in a bright, airy atmosphere. The flavors were nice. Cocktail menu limited to 4 beverages but all unique and enjoyable. The lobster risotto was short of lobster but made up for it in creamy rich flavor. The chicken liver mousse was also dense with sweet flavor. The fennel salad was interested with the hint of curry.,Routier was fabulous, the best that SF has to offer. All cocktails equally delicious especially the Mezcal one with amaro. Recommend the crispy Monterey Bay squid shatteringly crisp and tasty in its sauce. We also had Dungeness crab pave which was delightful. The fennel salad with hint of curry was a stand out as was the beet gazpacho served with the Formule Routier Prix. Amazing value. Rock cod with the prix fixe had just hint of lobster in the sauce. The halibut served over corn was cooked perfectly and the seasonal sweet corn risotto was delicious topped with crispy chanterelles. We shared everything and recommend this. The plum with marscapone served with the prix fixe will please those who love fruit desserts and the dark chocolate mousse was textural and salty and addictive. Go with the picpoul de pinet white wine on the wine list at $37 it was amazingly easy to drink and we had two bottles for three people. Service was friendly and efficient got a bit harried as the room filled but was always pleasant. We were never rushed. This is a gem of a restaurant with high ceilings and an airy brasserie feel including a bar where folks were eating and an upstairs seating area as well. Was buzzing but not too loud and easy to carry on convo. Just got a Bib Gourmand award from Michelin for its value, make reservations now you won't regret it.,Excellent food and service. Each bite was flavorful and was just the right amount. I can't wait to go back soon.,Great service, delicious food, reasonable price. Definitely recommend it.  Especially all breads are amazing.,One of the best new restaurants in San Francisco in 2021--and that ain't an easy feat!We were a party of 5 on a rainy night and were asked to show vax cards and IDs at the door, which we appreciated.   A lovely table upstairs was comfortable and the waiter and som knew their menu well.  The appetizers (crab pave, hen of the woods, chicken liver and fennel salad) were surprisingly creative and delish.  Entrees--lobster Grand Aioli," and risotto were outstanding.  The meat dishes (lamb shoulder and short ribs) were great but felt a bit more """"normal"""" as one would find elsewhere.Wine choices were reasonably priced--a bottle of California Cab and a French Malbec", were perfect complements.We can't wait to go back again.,Second time back since it opened.  The food is consistently delicious.  So flavorful.  Cocktails were perfect.  I had the beef, which I rarely do and it was YUM!  Again, get the Dungeness crab pave...one of the best apps I've ever had!,Loved our dinner at Routier last night! The service was so friendly and warm, and we really enjoyed the food. We can't wait to go back.Bests:Dungeness crab pave, spiced mayonnaise ($22)Crispy Monterey squid with our buerre diable, pickled chilies ($18)Really delicious:Blistered shishito peppers with cherry tomato vinaigrette, chili ($11)Baguette, buerre diable ($4.5)Crispy lamb shoulder, summer squash, sugar snap peas, and marinated Nardello peppers with fresh herbs ($31)Roasted halibut, buttered corn and summer beans, chili oil and dill ($28)Dark chocolate mousse, coffee crumble and chantilly ($11),My friend and I snagged an 8:30 reservation for last night, Saturday.  This review would be a 5, except for one major issue.  The lack of apology or follow up for *OLD fish*! The roasted cod, corn and beans, chili oil, and dill was perfectly prepared but... At first I thought the weird taste at the back of my throat was the chili oil.  But as I ate more of it, there was an ammonia taste and smell.  My friend said her fish tasted rancid. We both didn't want to eat more in case we got ill, and left the rest of the fish on the plate.  When the manager came to check on us," my friend asked when the fish was purchased; he answered Friday.  We told him the fish tasted old and I told him it had an ammonia smell.  He said """"oh"," I'll let the chef know"""".  It's known that an ammonia smell is from old fish. He never came back", and as we left the restaurant," we passed him and he just said """"good night"," see you again"""".  If he had returned to followup", or apologize, this review would be a 5 even with the old fish.  We weren't even looking for a freebie or anything, just an apology and/or followup.  From a Michelin BG rated restaurant, an offshoot of b. Patisserie, we expected more. The rest of the dishes, including the corn and beans on the cod dish, were excellent and unique.  The dungeness crab pave was delicately crispy with a fresh crab taste.  The beet salad a very interesting combination of savory and sweet; it was prob our favorite dish.  The pork shoulder was flavorful and tender. We had the dark chocolate mousse that was light and the crispy coffee crumble perfectly complimented it.  The pumpkin mascarpone mousse was also light and the pumpkin taste was delicate, not overpowering. Love the crispy pastry chips that are probably chips from b. Patisserie's famous Kouign amanns Like I said before, this review would be a 5, even with the fish, if the manager apologized or followed up.  I'll probably be back anyway; it was good.,Takeout on 11/8/20:Salmon pave - yummy beautiful dainty slices of cured salmon on top of a crispy potato pave. a green pesto-like sauce in between. yum.Tomato tonnato - savory tuna puree on top of fresh and tasty heirloom tomato chunks with yummy crunchy homemade croutons. Croutons were my favorite. Interesting and fresh dish. Glad we tried it.Pork shoulder confit, winter squash braised in apple cider and lentils - porky and rich, the light squash was a nice contrast. Nice touch of nicely paired acid and sweetness from the apple cider and fresh apple matchsticks.Black cod in lobster sauce, tomato compote, spinach, potato pave - black cod was delicate, lobster sauce was my favorite flavor of the night. I found the tomato compote to be a bit overpowering with the cod and lobster sauce and pushed it off to the side (but still ate it at the end). Spinach was cooked perfectly, as was the pave. Would order again.Apple tarte fine - the. pastry. was. DIVINE. flakiest thing I've eaten in a long time. highly recommend, def re-orderChocolate mousse - was alright. chocolately. not a huge fan of mousse, however way you put it. wouldn't order again.,Update: ate at Router live (during the window where we all thought COVID was finally over...).  It turns out their exceptional take-out food is even better when served fresh to your table, and that was coupled by really exceptional and attentive service across the Board.  This place really is firing on all cylinders, and we'll be back soon.,Renée-Nicole, Sommelier formerly of Charlie Trotter, and Gary Danko fame, is headlining an outstanding new, Francophile treasure in Pacific Heights. My wife and I just celebrated our 26year anniversary by securing our mature teenagers indoors, and hightailing to the city for a well-deserved night away. Having followed Renée-Nicole on twitter for years, I had been anticipating this restaurant's opening for months. The wait was worth every second! Having lived in France for 9 years prior to moving to the US, every moment eating Routier's wares reminded me of the outstanding dining experiences we'd had in France. From Michelin star excellence at Loiseau in Saulieu, to baked delicacies at DuPainPourDemain in Dijon, or any number of brasseries and cafés in Paris, Routier took us both back there in time. The salmon pavé was heavenly aromas atop a crunchy pillow of deliciousness. The beef cheeks were as flavorsome as they were gooey, and the financiers matched the best I'd tried across numerous French departments. Coupling this gastronomic masterpiece was a delightful Beaujolais to bring everything together. We'll be back when this is all over. Book us a table for two!,Great food," great service. Farro """"risotto""""", Maison Jolie cocktail, crab pave, and pate were all exemplary. Welcoming staff and the table was well maintained. Enjoyed.,Celebrate indoor dining here. Food is delicious and unique, vibe is fantastic and especially quiet in upstairs dining room. Dishes are best shared so everyone in your group gets a bite or two. Highlights were bread and butter--believe it or not--steelhead rillettes, summer squash, and lamb shoulder. Among our party of 4, we shared 7 dishes, no dessert.  Bill with mixed drinks and tip came to a tad over $300, so probably best for a special occasion. Nice addition to the SF dining scene. Lovely service in a warm and welcoming atmosphere.,Heading into SF to see Bourdain doc and literally stumbled in.  Open parking meter right in front sealed the deal. Zero expectations. Routier hit every mark at a high level. Comfortable neighborhood brassiere vibe that was thoughtfully designed. Always happy to sit at the bar and bartender (John) set the perfect tone for a real pleasant quick dinner out. Whoever is running the kitchen knows wtf is up. No exaggeration best brassiere meal I've had in SF. Crispy Squid, Crab Pave," and Lobster Risotto were equally mind blowing especially the risotto. Restaurant risotto is tricky: too al dente or congealed mush or Routier's perfectly executed silky creamy version. Nice value priced compact wine list. Would love to see a baguette """"burger"""" or steak frites option but that's just me. Legit spot built for the long haul def worth trying. Can't wait to go back.",We were excited to be eating at this restaurant since we had heard good things. At the table next to us I saw an entree that looked great so I ordered it. I couldn't believe what they served me. Our neighbors had dinner plates with good sized portions of food. I was served a tiny little plate with only a fraction of the amount of food our neighbors were served. Really, my entree was served on what looked like a bread plate, it was that small, not even the size of a salad plate. The portion was tiny compared to our neighbors. Tiny! In fact everything brought to our table was small. If you look at the photos on their website of food served at the restaurant they look normal sized. We didn't get anything like what the website photos depict. As soon as I got home I had to have a snack. Also worth mentioning is the fact that the deserts were really uninspiring. They like mousse there which is easy for them but boring. Where are the pastries? Where is the apple tart? Or any tart for that matter? After our dinner the four of us took a pole to see who would return to the restaurant. No-one said that they would return. Too bad.,Fabulous new French spot on food and service. You can tell the restaurant is focused on quality and adventures in dining. Can't wait to come back and try something new. Great wine list and cocktails as well.,I've been to this spot before (for a quick cocktail) but tonight I got the panna cotta at the bar for the hell of it and it was maybe the best panna cotta I've ever had? I haven't been here for dinner before because I work nights," but I was so impressed with this dessert that I think I'll put Routier on my list of places to make it to soon. The cocktail I had was also delicious and so well balanced.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rise Over Run,"Awesome new rooftop bar in a city that needs more rooftop bars. It's a little tricky finding The Line Hotel but if you check out one of the glass doors on Turk right where Turk meets Market, you'll find yourself at The Line. Go in, ask front desk to send you up the elevator, and you'll end up at Rise Over Run. They offer you both indoor and outdoor seating on the roof. Outdoor has the views and the firepits but indoor is a cool solarium that protects against the elements. We sat inside and it felt like we were gathering in a greenhouse. There was a decent choice of drinks on the menu and I went with the Tiki drink that had matcha in it. I don't remember the name of the drink but it was the only one with matcha in it. Came out as a creamy milkshake kind of drink- amazingly delicious but I don't know that I could get more than one in a night.,I always love a rooftop! The service here was helpful and sweet; overall an excellent experience. We ordered the fried chicken thighs and the spicy tuna tostada, and a glass of Prosecco: - Prosecco: I am not a wine connoisseur by any means, but I really enjoyed this glass of prosecco. It was chilled and came to our table quickly! - Fried chicken thighs: the star of the show. I mean, look at that picture! They put it in a fancy stand with three dipping sauce options. The chicken was great and super crispy. I preferred eating it alone with no sauces, to be honest! - spicy tuna tostada: good but not memorable. While I would get the fried chicken again, I don't know if I would order this.,My best friend and I were staying at the new Line Hotel and decided to try our luck at getting into their cute rooftop bar. We went right at opening and fortunately since it was raining as well there were plenty of seats at the bar. We got the Full Moon Over Rise and the Tuk Tuk Julius. Both of the drinks were delicious. I was amazed that the Tuk Tuk Julius tasted just like an orange creamsicle! We were both very satisfied with our drinks. The food however wasn't remarkable. We only had two smaller dishes but the tuna tostada was a bit on the salty side and the chili shrimp were undercooked and not very flavorful.I'd definitely come back again for the view (when it's not raining) and try more of the wonderful drinks.,Come for the city views. Stay for the drinks. Enjoy the music and pretty hipster people and love the bar bit foods.  The chicken thighs. Salmon tostada with crispy chili are delicioso and the pork belly is a must. The dhs are here theusday nights (Feb 2023),Amazing cocktail bar with a cool greenhouse vibe. Located at the top of the Line Hotel, we came here with two friends and, among us, tried every cocktail on the menu. Honestly not a single miss, which is incredible. My personal favorite was the tuk tuk Julius, which was essentially like an adult orange julius- so good, very glad I got that last otherwise I could have had like 10 of these haha. The food menu isn't extensive but is actually surprisingly excellent. The fried chicken in particular was tender and juicy- somewhat surprising for a place that primarily sells alcohol. We came at night and the view was nice- I imagine once it gets warmer, there's a cool outdoor space that would also be nice for an early evening hang. Definitely highly recommend!,Very impressive cocktails and a beautiful rooftop, perfect for dinner and drinks with friends or a date. We brought a group of 6 friends for a walk in and they were able to get us a table outside by the fire. It's was so cute and cozy. Every single drink we ordered was a 11/10, so tasty and unique. I'd recommend the ""one way ticket"". Will be back to have dinner,Rise Over Run is a new rooftop bar in the city. They're located on top of the Line Hotel. This place has great vibes, there are strawberry bushes on the rooftop, a great view of the city and a nice menu of small bites and drinks. Although I do wish they'll extend their menu as they iron out the kinks!I came here on a Thursday night and made reservations with special request to sit at the fire pit because it's been extremely cold the last weeks. When we arrived the super kind front desk guy helped us and immediately we spent the first 10 minutes just having a conversation and him telling us more about the building. His customer service was outstanding! I never met anyone else who is genuinely so happy to talk to customers for that long :)He showed us our way to the rooftop where we were taken care of by Sophie. I was not expecting the fire pit seating because it is a highly desirable spot especially on cold nights like right now. But Sophie held it for us, I was so happy. It really is the best seat in the house because you're not only staying cozy and warm, but you get the view of the skyline right in front of you. If the fire pit and heat lamps aren't enough to keep you warm, you can ask for blankets. We ordered a couple of drinks, oysters and fries. The drink that stood out to me and I HIGHLY recommend is the Tuk Tuk Julius - it's like you're drinking a spiked Thai iced tea with a hint of orange. Please get it. Thank me later. Their crinkle cut fries were also very crunchy and came out hot, everyone's favorite kind of fries. As for the oysters, they only serve the best, Miyagi oysters. We were checked on pretty often and the service was pretty quick. Great vibes, mellow music and it's not too busy right now. Definitely pay them a visit before everyone finds out about the new rooftop bar in town.,I thought Rise over Run was ok. For a new rooftop bar in the city, I was excited to check it out l, but after visiting it wasn't mind blowing or anything. The views are mediocre and the staff is super slow when ordering and bringing out the food & drinks. In regards to the food, I thought the fried chicken was pretty good - it was super crispy and the sweet sauce that came with it was a nice touch. The oysters are fresh. I liked the tuna tostada as well, but it was a bit overpriced for one tostada. I would pass on the pork belly though. As for the drinks, I got the tuk tuk julius. It tasted meh the flavors didn't fuse well together. Tbh the drinks downstairs in Tenderheart which is also located in the Line hotel tasted better imo. Other than that, they do give you blankets since it gets chilly outside which is nice, but overall I don't think I would frequent this spot.,This is a great rooftop bar at the new Line Hotel in the Tenderloin in SF.It hasn't been publicly known that the hotel has this amazing bar in an Atrium on the rooftop. When you approach the greet stand you are able to see  the views of the city which are amazing and this is a beautifully designed space that makes for a luxury hang out. We sat at the small bar and the waitress  was wonderful. She provided an insight to the drunk menu and recommended each of us a drink on the menu to our spirit preferences. The drinks were far from disappointment because each drink was delightful, tasty and very well balanced in ingredients. Great space but make sure to check out the outside seating area with individual fire pits to keep you warm and toasty on the cold SF evenings.,Super delicious food.  Really really great atmosphere and wow, the view!!! Incredible service, can't recommend enough! Thank you to Chelan for the great service! Super friendly with a fantastic smile. Thanks Preston for delicious drinks & great service!,It's great bar and great service Apologies for really bad drunk at the bar. The staff were really helpful that what my husband told me.,What an incredible find! We are math teachers and we were in town for a conference. We found Rise Over Run on Yelp and we were so glad that we did. Only recently opened but an amazing experience. Good food, beautiful view and environment, and fantastic staff. We shared the burger and oysters. Loved the blankets by the fire!,So excited for SF to get a fabulous new rooftop bar! Views and ambience were great, music was awesome, loved the food and drink.,Great brand-new rooftop bar in the heart of the city! Excellent drinks and impeccable service by our fabulous bartender Jessica - will definitely be back and highly recommended to all my friends and family. See you soon, Rise Over Run!,Hard to find...a little loud, this spot is a great place to meet friends for some tasty cocktails and equally yummy bites.  The space is cozy and stunning.  Exterior is great around the fire pits.,OKAYYY TENDERLOIN! I see you. This new rooftop bar is really swanky. Love the fire pits, cocktails are delicious and well made. I had their mescal with chili drink, can't remember the name, very well balanced. Great service. They have some food but I didn't try it. Just there for the vibes. Would love to come on a warmer night and maybe catch some golden hour up there. Great for date night. One downside is it's pretty pricing.,This hotel is a showstopper especially among the caliber of hotels in San Francisco! Definitely the hottest & newest in town, the LINE has thought of everything & brought the hotel, cocktail & food game to the next level. For years San Francisco has needed a hotel that is this gorgeous & thought out!! Rise over Run rooftop bar is stunning & has the best, most unique cocktails I've ever had in San Francisco, rivaling many I've had in my life! We got to meet the chef Daniel who is a cocktail genius & generously gifted us an extra cocktail, The Connection, which was dill forward and delicious, but every single cocktail is a revelation of amazing flavors that thrills! We had pristine oysters with incredible taste, perfectly shucked and the boneless chicken thigh wings presented in a cage with very much appreciated homemade dressings. Every single cocktail is a home run. There is lots of security on the property and to ensure safety outside. Run, don't walk to all the experiences this hotel has to offer!,Perched on top of the 13th floor is Rise over Run. This place has everything as far as the vibe and atmosphere. Unfortunately, the menu or lack there of leaves a lot to be desired. Its there, like right there, the potential to be amazing just definitely going through growing pains. Hoping they build the menu to include a Vegetarian option other than Crudités and French fries as we are in San Francisco. Other than our servers amazing matte lipstick come for the cocktails or wait until the Summer when I'm sure it will be all the talk!,Nice place, amazing city view, very surprisingly good drinks! The service is really nice too,Always looking for a new rooftop in SF. Rise over run brings sophistication and fun to the TL making it one of my favorite scenic restaurants in SF. Once you get over the stunning view you're able to indulge yourself in craft cocktails and a limited menu with only the best. Not only were the food and drinks good, but the service completely elevated our experience. Absolutely loved the attention to detail each service member had. Moderately priced with such an upscale sense of hospitality. We will absolutely return!,This place is such a vibe! Great music, gorgeous views at night. We sat inside and the views were just as great. Ordered the tuna tostada (great taste overall) and the chicken thighs which were also very tasty! Comes served on a food tower with several pieces with three different dipping sauces. Definitely will be back!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CreoLa,"The very definition of a hidden gem.I found this place on Yelp and my friend made a reservation for 6 people (they DID require a ""deposit"")This place has limited indoor seating due to the super cool 2 story layout. Kinda a small dining room on main level, then a balcony of seats on floor 2 that surrounds the dining room on 2 sides.  Our table of 6 was all by itself on the right upper level- so perfect for us to all catch up with each other.Our FANTASTIC waiter Frederick was friendly and attentive, I wanted a lot of ice, he brought us 2 pitchers of ice! We ordered drinks (note that due to them only have a wine/beer license, their ""cocktails"" are made with low-proof rum or vodka.)We ordered some fried okra and some corn muffins to start and share.  The okra comes with a snappy dipping sauce. (Note the corn muffins are pretty small).I ordered the fried chicken (leg and thigh) with Jambalaya and the collard greens. My man had the short ribs with red beans and rice and cream cheese grits.  Both entrees were heaven, but the fried chicken is one of the top 5 fried chicken dinners in SF. Very crispy and not greasy.For dessert we split all three dessert offerings: a steamed white chocolate bread pudding, pecan pie and the beignets.  Of the 3 we all enjoyed the bread pudding the most.Note there is a $26 lunch special we all agreed we wanted to come back for - which includes an appetizer a entree and a dessert. (If I am remembering correctly),I really wanted to like this pace. We are in need of good creole cuisine. Unfortunately they were having a private party that night. We sat outside, but I think you miss out of the experience. The smells of all the food. The feel of the place. All missing. The food looked alright, but lacked the outstanding taste.I had the shrimp and grits. I normally love this dish. This just didn't grab me. My friend had the Shrimp & Crawfish Étouffée that was slightly better.The cornbread was wonderful! I could have eaten a whole plate of these! And it didn't even need the extra butter, yum!,I enjoyed the vibes of this place. It was decorated nicely for the holiday season.The food was decent. I'm not sure if anything stood out so much that would make me come back. Fried okra appetizer was good, great plate to share. The shrimp Po boy was decent. The portion was pretty large, and I only had half and took the rest to go. And it comes with a side salad which is nice. Overall, the mains were good, but not great. Beignets with a salted caramel sauce and the bread pudding were both great dessert options. I would recommend these.,Def worth heading into Cole Valley for this gem of a restaurant. We were sat upstairs and enjoyed it. They currently have cute holiday decorations. The service was fantastic. Our server Julian was incredibly attentive and accommodating. Really appreciated that he asked for food allergies right at the beginning. The food was great. Our table shared the fried okra, hush puppies, and boudin balls--all were tasty. I had the short ribs with collard greens and creamy grits. Highly recommend. For dessert with the bread pudding and beignets--would also highly recommend.  The only thing worth nothing was the restaurant was bit smoky inside and a few us needed a moment to stop coughing.,Meh? It was nice to come here at least once, but I wouldn't come back for any dish or side. We had the boudin balls, fried okra, braised short rib, gumbo, shrimp and crawfish etouffee, and fried chicken to share between the three of us. Highlights - service was fantastic, the ambiance reminded us of NOLA, and the etouffee was seasoned and cooked very well. Things that we'd pass on if we came back - the boudin balls didn't have much flavor, the gumbo was extremely briny, and the short rib didn't come out as tender as we would have liked. For the price point, we were also expected some larger portions, but it is what it is. We would opt for a different creole restaurant the next time around.,Came here with my friends for lunch during the SF Restaurant week. It's a cute little restaurant at the corner of the intersection. There were still quite a few people there at 1pm on a Saturday. I got the seafood gumbo as my appetizer and the shrimp & crawfish etouffee as my entree. The pre fix menu included a piece of beignet as dessert. Seafood gumbo - I've had better. There weren't much of that Cajun kick. Shrimp & crawfish etouffee - my first time trying etouffee so I don't have anything to compare it with. The stew/sauce it came with was on the sweet side. It was decent, but not mind blowing. The corn bread (?) it came with was pretty good though. Beignet - my first time having a fresh beignet. It was soooo good. Perfect sweetness & texture. I loved the sugar powder they used too, but that was prob just genetic powder lol. Overall, 3.5 stars. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if you're in this area and craving dessert, I'd recommend giving their beignet a try. Rounding it up to 4 stars for the cornbread and beignet.,Love this bright corner spot serving up elevated Nola cuisine! Really cute space, would be a great spot for a private party. Fantastic chicken jambalaya - I've never had the pleasure of a whole piece of chicken in my jambalaya let alone one soooo juicy. Friend got the mushroom jambalaya which looked good too, and she cleaned her plate. We tried the boudin balls (delish - and yes you can taste the liver) and oyster brochettes, both of which I'd recommend. Was a little meh on the hush puppies (give me more corn!) and beignets (I expected lighter - these were quite dense). Then the fried okra was maybe just a little too much fried food with remoulade you know? Staff was lovely and really busy. FYI they do charge you a deposit for reservations so make sure they subtract that from your final bill!,I went for SF restaurant week and got their lunch menu. I often find that SF restaurant week is really worth it. Usually it's smaller portions, or the same food bundled together into a pre fixe menu and more expensive. I had previously been to CreoLa and really enjoyed their food so I decided to visit again.I got the cornmeal crusted catfish, which comes with two sides. The catfish pieces were huge. The crust was perfectly intact and wasn't soggy. It didn't feel greasy either even though it was deep fried. Highly recommend order this.The beignet was fresh and hot. More doughy than other beignets that I've had, but still good.The vegan soup was the most disappointing because it was just black eyed peas and green beans (which I ordered for my sides). Nothing special about it.The service was pretty good. We were seated on the second floor and the staff would come and check in on us from time to time.The restaurant itself is very cute and definitely had some New Orleans vibes. If they played jazz music that's be the cherry on top.,CreoLa was a beautiful splash of color and flavor in the middle of the workweek, when I visited SF in July. It's one of the *few* times where I'll admit that my environment was so comfortable and rich (piano music, large windows for people-watching) that I didn't mind the speed of service---mind you, it wasn't slow, but it wasn't speedy. However, this is likely due to the fact that the food is made with ingredients that are quality, and taste+feel incredibly fresh. I definitely got the sense that my food was made to order.Be on the lookout for lunch specials that allow you to sample a bit of everything. I definitely could have done that (eg. that day, they were serving pre fixe lunched with your choice of entree). I opted for a gorgeous catfish po'boy, because that Cajun-style fish is so flavorful. Perfectly crispy, sandwiched between perfectly soft and buttery French bread. The kind you expect to cut into your mouth, but this one didn't. I also shared in the Cajun jambalaya, and just look at that color. Spicy, salty, right where my heart needed to be that afternoon.But despite the generous portions, we always have room for fresh beignets with caramel sauce. From the entrees to the piping-hot pastries, CreoLa was dripping with decadence and sheer experience. Definitely give it a try, and always leave room for dessert.,Food was 4/5 stars but the ambiance and service knocked it to a 5. Such a cute little place that transports you out of SF with the jazz music and interior design! The seafood it came with was cooked well; and the dishes were solid. We got the gumbo, fried okra, crawfish and shrimp etouffe, green beans with shaved garlic and side of cornbread. I liked all the dishes but would say it didn't blow my mind. But I really appreciated the server who was so kind and checked up on us at all the right times.,I'm impressed. CreoLa's cute interior sets the stage for the amazing meal you are about to have. They have nailed cooked chicken. My chicken jumbalaya was so incredibly moist and flavorful. We even started our meals with a bene and coffee for an affordable $6! CreoLa is great for a casual brunch and also a nice dinner out. Since it's located right next to the park, you can take a walk after to burn off the calories from your delicious meal.,This place and food is amazing! Fredrick our waiter was nothing more of perfect and awesome. We ordered the Chef's Special catfish and it was just full of flavors. We also ordered the Cajun Jambalaya and the chicken was so moist and flavorful. I could not stop saying ""damn"" because the food was so damn good. Definitely making this place a tradition to stop and eat whenever we are in the city.,Had a wonderful dinner out at CreoLa! Planned a day trip with some friends to Haight Street and heard about CreoLa from a friend! We enjoyed a nice meal inside and enjoyed the nice ambience and views of the park by the window. Service was wonderful, and the food was delicious and authentic. I enjoyed their corn sangria and the shrimp and grits was exceptional! Highly recommend checking out this spot, they also had a great & reasonable wine list to pair with the food. Great spot!,Ordered DoorDash delivery. We got the gumbo & the jambalaya. Mmmmmm Oh so delicious! Food delivered nice & hot. I was pleasantly surprised. Portion for delivery/ take out is kinda small for gumbo at $16 bucks. I feel the dine-in experience would be portioned much better. Jambalaya was really good as well.  Looking at the Yelp photos I really want to try that salad of theirs w/ walnuts and apples. Tried to make it for SF Restaurant Week. But I mean hey.. I'll dine-in and update my review soon. ( sorry no pictures ) And remember y'all..... #YaGottaEat2LiveDDB,Very good food. Great service. New Orleans decor. It very much reminded me of a french colonial home. They have a everything from gumbo to fried chicken. We ordered hush puppies, bacon wrapped oysters, etoufeé and beignets. Everything was delicious.,Great service and great food.  5 stars!Service:- Creola has a small parklet that we can bring our dog.   Parket is sheltered from the wind and has heaters.- Friendly wait staffs.  Quick and attentive service.- clean bathroomFood:- Got two prix fixe menus during SF restaurant week.   Pricing and value is decent.- Hush puppies - awesome, crunchy in the outside, warm and fluffy inside.  Sauce is good.- Black eyed pea and green bean soup is much better than we expected- Seafood gumbo - we will definitely get the gumbo again- etouffee is awesome.   even the shrimp is fresh and not over-cooked- Fried chicken - It's good but there must be better fried chicken in town.  love the red bean and rice side dish.,I felt energized after this meal. Plenty of room during weekend brunch, no reservations needed. I got the breakfast jambalaya and it was just the right amount of food. Everything was tasty and flavorful without being too heavy, salty, or greasy. The vibes inside was like a trip to NOLA.,Don't miss this little gem of a restaurant just because it's not on the same street as all the other popular restaurants in Cole Valley!Between two people, we shared the cajun jambalaya w/ chicken, fried oysters en brochette, and crispy boudin balls. The boudin balls had a variety of ingredients (sausage, pork belly, rice, and chicken liver) and it is so DELICIOUS. These little balls hold so much flavor and dipped in their Remoulade sauce makes this the perfect appetizer. We chose to sit in their outdoor seating and I liked how they had patio heaters between each table. This city can get quite cold (and I'm especially sensitive to the cold), so this is an essential! Also, since it's not located on a super busy street, you don't hear loud cars zooming by as you are eating. Overall, super happy that we decided to explore the neighborhood and stumbled across this restaurant. However, taking one star away because of the slow service we received despite there not being a dinner rush nor too many customers. We waited a little over half an hour for our food to come and when we requested hot sauce, our waiter kept forgetting about it! All things considered -- I think if you're looking for good food, not on a time crunch, and looking for a place to chat, this is a place worth checking out. :),All around good. Very attentive friendly staff. Insanely good, fresh and flavorful food. Cool space. Reasonably priced. What's not to love? CreoLa will be a regular spot for us.,Food was good but service was great.  Julian was our server and I would rate 6 stars.  We 8 people in our party and they sat us upstairs, like a den.  It was great, felt like a private room.We actually forgot to mention our children have food allergies, Julian asked about any food allergies.  Very kids friendly place.I had chicken jambalaya.  The whole juices chicken thigh on top of jambalaya.  It was good but a little salty for me.  But my son loved it, he had the same.  Most of the parties has catfish special, it was good.  The portions were a little small but perfect because room for dessert.  He had beignets and rice pudding.  The desserts were not that sweet so was very good.,When in SF restaurant week, there is a wide selection of different restaurants and menus that are all tempting but my friend and I decided on Cajun/Creole cuisine and were not disappointed!!! The highlight for us were definitely the beignets and bread pudding which were fresh and hot!!! The service was great and the ambience was really cute as well (they decorated for fall and spooky season). The fried chicken and short ribs were good and the food was seasoned well and I liked how it wasn't super heavy! All in all, definitely would return!,Truly a hidden gem. Loved everything we ordered. Service was great and we went at quieter times of no rush.,Stopped by after a walk at golden gate park as they had crawfish by the pound. So glad we stopped! Great seafood for a great price,One of my girlfriends and I came here last week for SF Restaurant Week and the food was bomb. I have to give a big thank you to the staff from check in to our departure. So, I accidentally booked a reservation at their second location not even realizing there was more than one (I've got my eye on you reservation system that I can't recall right now LOL). The host couldn't find my name even though I showed him my reservation confirmation. They brought over who I believe was the manager who double checked as well and then asked if I made the rezzy at their sister spot. Yup, did that.But he was able to accommodate my friend and I outside for seating which worked out fine. He made sure to pull a heating lamp up for our table because my friend gets cold easily. Plus it's SF at night. Outdoor seating was cute with strings of light and this grass-like wall that was part of the decor. Our server, Stephanie, was so sweet and answered all of our questions making sure we were well taken care of. The food was sooo yummy from start to finish. I chose the seafood gumbo, catfish st. Charles, and bread pudding for my trio. The chef did his thing with each dish! I would have given this restaurant 5 stars if their menu were more clear on ingredients of the food. My friend lives a vegan lifestyle and ordered their one entree option. On the side it came with cornbread which wasn't specified as being vegan. Turns out it wasn't but I'm glad my friend confirmed with the manager before taking a bite. She has some food allergies as well so things could have gone south. I would return to this spot!,Visited this cute, quaint restaurant with my friend and husband. All three of us loved our meals! The service was good and everything was pretty much perfect. Try the collard greens! They were absolutely scrumptious. My fried chicken was crisp and tasty. Next time I will try the short rib. Yummy!,Me and my boyfriend had a great experience! Food was delicious and exactly like described in the menu. We went during the San Francisco restaurant week and it was totally worth it! they had a great menu and we were able to taste a lot of their food. The attention was amazing! We didn't have a reservation but the host was very friendly and she accommodated us, the server was excellent. We're very happy with our experience, we will definitely come back.,You know that feeling when you take a single bite of a restaurant's food and you KNOW the rest is gonna be amazing? CreoLa will give you those chills. The flavors were so incredibly balanced, flavorful without being all salt, crisp without being oily, sweet without hurting your teeth. It was so so good! I haven't had a ton of authentic cajun food before, but this was light and healthy and complex and absolutely hit the spot. One of the best meals I've had in recent memory, especially the oysters! They were so unbelievably tender on the inside and lightly crisp on the outside. And the dipping sauce! Please do yourself a favor, go to CreoLa and get the oysters and also the rest of the menu, too. Service was great, and they have both indoor and outdoor seating, though not a ton of heat lamps. Super cute and fun vibe!,The food is quite good but the portions are a little small for the price. This might be better for my health but usually NOLA type spots give you a lot of food. We had the fried okra, shrimp and grits, and the cornmeal crusted catfish with sides of jambalaya and red beans and rice. Their fried stuff is really good. The breading is excellent and they do a great job not overcooking whatever the tried thing is.,I live a couple blocks from this place and I was always intrigued about the charming look -  so me and my boyfriend decided to try it out and boy we were NOT disappointed.Although it took a bit long for the server to come ask us for us order, the friendly service and amazing quality in food made up for it.The highlights for us were most definitely the pear salad with lavender vinaigrette and the braised short ribs, paired with the Cabernet on the menu was just *chefs kiss*Unfortunately they have no heaters inside and have a window upstairs they cannot close so it's rather chilly inside. This in combination with the long amount of time to be served is the only reasons why I didn't give 5 stars. However I do highly recommend if you're in the neighborhood to try it out, the ambience makes for a lovely date night spot. Will be back soon!,One of my favs. Shrimp Etoufee and Catfish were delicious. I highly recommend if you are looking for a New Orleans style bistro.,Food was excellent, we had Jambalaya, Etoufee, catfish and red beans and rice. Everything was wonderful. We are amazed this does not have more reviews, but the food was flavorful and had just the right amount of spice.,Blackened Catfish with greens, red beans with rice, and an excellent pea soup. Also came with a wonderful small corn cake. I usually like their Gumbo but last time was a disappointing batch but this vegetarian pea soup is really flavorful. A must try!,Outstanding, authentic and high quality food. YES Go there NOW. Have been there 3x now; have tried the signature entrees Etouffee and Jambalaya. Takes you to New Orleans.  On the most recent visit my companion - a dessert fan - ordered the Pecan Pie. Wow! If you like Pecan Pie it'll do you for some nice long time.,Great service. The waiter was polite and attentive. I had the fried chicken which was good but not great.,Sometimes you just get lucky parking right next to this restaurant when visited San Francisco recently. We didn't have an idea and it looked nice and cozy on a Sunday afternoon we decided to go in and we're not disappointed. Great southern menu I had Po'Boy sandwich which was lovely and we ordered some beignets. I want to come back and sample more of their menu. Really enjoyed the casual simple vibe and friendly staff,We were near by at a Soccer game for my son and we were looking for a place to grab dinner with him before we parted ways for him to go back on campus. Creole was perfect great ambiance and the location was easy to see parking as well it the city so but we followed the recommendation of our waiter and was close. Food checked off all our boxes delicious, hot, nicely plated and service was top notch.  Highly recommend it I had the Catfish special hubby had gumbo and short ribs and son had Andouille Po Boy.....everyone was happy,Truly fantastic New Orleans-style/Creole cuisine with a bit of a unique approach to each dish. Chicken jambalaya was deconstructed. With an incredibly tasty and well prepared chicken quarter on top of rice with a fantastic sauce. Blackened, catfish, stuffed with crab and shrimp was amazing and elevated. Hush puppies were a little dense, but everything else was spot on. Highly recommended!,Solid brunch place for some Cajun style food.I got the Catfish roll and it was pretty good. The fish was fried just right, neither too dry or not crispy enough. The outdoor seating was nice, and the service was okay. The jumbalaya is like a fried rice, I was expecting it to have more sauce with it, still fairly tasty though. Good place overall, would recommend.,Casual girls day lunch out. Our first visit to this corner spot and found the ambiance relaxing, quaint & clean. Service was friendly. We all ordered the various lunch specials and found everything delicious. The warm beignets, yum. Will come back.,CreoLA...ahahhaha like Crayola..New Orleans restaurants in San Francisco. The San Francisco of the South. HAHA If u like New Orleans cooking. Here it is. I had the hushpuppies..hashpuppies today. I love hushpuppies. I had the cream grits and it was pretty good. It was like jook Chinese jook. I also had the bread pudding and it was gourmet tiny serving in a circle shape with cinnamon. It was a fun shop to try the food. It was on Stanyan and I hadn't been here. I tripped on the entry. Here's to New Orleans food.,Food is great and the waiter forgot our dessert on the prefixed menu and the kitchen's lead time is a bit long,Went there for dinner on a warm SF day. There is a special SF week restaurant menu. $44 for 3 courses. Most items from special menu are from regular menu. I am not too hungry so only ordered from regular menu. A lager and a buttermilk fried chicken (leg and thigh). As usual food and drink are good. Nice warm day to sit outside also,Amazing cajun food in a quirky little stylish two story corner space. Carries an excellent cider. Probably my favorite. Not cheap or fast, so plan accordingly.,Our first time here w/friends and family.SF has long been missing a true Cajun style restaurant with all the fixings.We were seated upstairs so we could see all the happenings below.Charming environment, sweet space and not too loud.Due to the extensive menu and the fact there was 4 of us, we could order a little bit of everything, which we did, natch.The best part for me is EVERYTHING was HOT upon arrival. Too often some part of every meal for me is ""luke warm"" and I have to send it back. Complimentary Corn Bread Muffins, The Corn Bread Muffin starter was To Die For.Appetizers - Oyster Brochettes and crispy boudin balls. Again, a winner.Entrees - Cajun Jambalaya with a kick and so plentiful, I was able to take a full serving home. Brined Fried Chicken - OMG, just the right amount of crisp and nice and moist on the inside. Incredible flavor and seasonings.Shrimp and Crawfish Etouffee & Shrimp & Grits, these were both such a hit, our friends allowed us a taste before they pulled their plates back for their own delight.Red Beans and Rice & Collard Greens, We probably didn't need these, but gee, we had to try everything. Again, these did not disappoint.Dessert - We really didn't have much room left, but again, they were both too enticing now to try. These were both the best of either I have ever had anywhere, Bread Pudding and Pecan Pie.The server was so engaging, professional and attentive.Our beverages were always topped off w/o even asking.Meal pacing was perfect.I think this ran about $45 per person including tax and a generous top - 25%.Our only negative was the fact a window was broken over the front door, which created a very cold draft to the upstairs seating. They had one floor heat lamp, but it just couldn't keep up w/the chill. So we ate w/our jackets on the entire meal and were all freezing by the time we left. We did mention this when we left, but I can't remember what the server said.Hopefully they can get that fixed sooner rather than later.Seeking real Creole food w/a flair that won't break your bank, this is a must to add to your dining list.,Cute spot with delicious food! Parking was relatively easy on a Sunday evening. When you walk in, it feels like a southern estate - it's a two level restaurant and it feels like a house. We are upstairs and noticed the nice chandelier and being able to look out into the street.We ordered the fried chicken, cornmeal crusted catfish, cream cheese grits, jambalaya, hopping John, collared greens, and beignets. It all came with a corn muffin.It was obvious the muffins were fresh along with the the chicken and catfish - steam was coming out as you cut into it and pipin' hot. Jambalaya had a lot of flavor! The only recommendation I would make is that the passion fruit spritz tasted watered down and did not have much flavor. The beignets were good, but didn't care for the caramel dipping sauce - it would be nice if there was a variety.Overall, good food and friendly service. I'll be back!,We decided to come here on a whim on Saturday morning, and we ordered the fried chicken with collard greens and red beans and rice, shrimp and grits, an Abita Haze, and a purple corn sangria.  Dessert was the beignets and two coffees.The mains were awesome. The shrimp and grits was well seasoned and smoky, but not overly powerful.  Shrimps were perfectly cooked.  The grits were much smoother than what we were used to, but it wasn't gummy or plain.  The au jus from the shrimp and sauce melded well with the lighter grits.Fried chicken was perfectly seasoned with salt, pepper, and other spices.  Skin was nicely crisp, and went well with the sides. Red beans and rice had nice plump red beans, nice cuts of green onion, and just a bit of juice (Chicken stock maybe?).  A tad salty, but it went with the moist chicken.  Collard greens were, for lack of a better word, al dente. It was cooked through with the ham hock, but my friend is used to almost a braised collard green consistency (at least when it comes to Southern style cooking).  I personally didn't mind since I just love collard greens.  The sangria was a tad on the sweet side, but it wasn't overly cloying.  If you like sweet drinks, try it. For those who don't, probably stick to the beer or wine. Finally the beignets.  They used a different wheat flour, as the taste of the grain cane through.  It was a different flavour profile for a beignet, but it was still nice.  My only issue was the consistency.  The waitress thought they were fluffy, but they were a bit too dense.  It wasn't doughy or carb central, but whatever flour they use makes it a heavier beignet.  If you take a bit, you see how the dough leans more to one side, rather than being uniform throughout.  In summary, good flavour, dense consistency (for a beignet).  I expect a beignet to practically melt in the mouth, like a malasada or even a funnel cake.  Beignets from Iron Horse in Sac or Angeline's in Berkeley are the light, fluffy pillows that will melt without you even trying.Service was lovely.  The waitress was very nice and accommodating.  She kept our waters and drinks filled and checked on us throughout the meal.  The chef even came by and jokingly said our food will get cold (we were taking pics) since he made the dishes five minutes earlier.  Very warm welcome overall.  Decor (from what I saw) reminded me of the architecture in the French Quarter.  Very cute and welcoming.  My only gripe would be the bathroom gnats.  Bathroom itself was clean, but there were literally 10 gnats flying in the one stall.  They may want to invest in a huge fan at the doors to keep the gnats out or get some bug spray out before the lunch and dinner shifts.But for the food and service, I'd love to return on a somewhat regular basis.  Probably once every few weeks, especially once they have indoor seating again.,Insanely good. Hardly crowded. Try fried chicken, ribs, collards, jambalaya, dessert of pecan pie. Skip the chicory coffee.,This place was so good I ate here three days in a row.5/5 stars, highly recommendCome for the gumbo ; stay for the beignets... try the hurricane too,Delicious friend chicken! We love to get the family meal with 2 breasts / 2 legs / 2 wings. Everyone gets what they want. Yummy mashed potatoes, green beans, and okra 100% necessary to complete the meal!,Found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Made reservations and got there early, and they were able to accommodate us. We were taken upstairs, with a nice view overlooking the quaint restaurant. Once seated, we ordered appetizers, starting with the shrimp hush puppies and bacon wrapped oysters. The shrimp hush puppies were really good (regular hush puppies with cut shrimp in a sauce). The bacon wrapped oysters were different, but also good. For dinner, we ordered beer braised short ribs that came with collard greens and jambalaya. We also ordered the gumbo. The food took about an hour to arrive, they said there was a ""glitch"" with the orders in the computer. Both dinners were decent in size portion and taste. Collard greens were just ok.For dessert we had both the bread pudding and beignets. The beignets were ok, the caramel sauce saved it. The bread pudding didn't taste homemade, and the pecans were dry. The vanilla drizzle was ok.Overall a cool experience in the heart of San Francisco. The ambiance and music was really soulful. On to the next foodie adventure!,This place is a gem. Good food, ambiance and they played light jazz after 2pm the day we were there. Red beans and rice were perfectly seasoned as well. NOTE: try the pecan cheesecake and the bread pudding!,Summary: mixed service, food ok, priced high for what it is.We show up with reservations.  It's 2 of us and they seat us at a small table.  Given that there wasn't a single other occupied table in the place - I asked if we could sit at a bigger table as I wanted to order a lot of dishes and wanted more space on the table.  They would not accommodate this request.  And not a single other table was occupied the whole time we were there - I would have been less annoyed if they had at least another customer come in and use a table.   Also, I think one of the severs was new and the more seasoned server made a few mistakes.The gumbo was solid.  I would get that again.  Everything else was meh.  Chicken is way better at Popeyes  and for a fraction of the cost.  The braised short ribs were fairly dry -- still good as it's hard to mess up short ribs, but perhaps one of the least tasty preparations of it that I've had.  The jambalaya was plain and boring.  Popeyes does a better red beans and rice (as do I).  Theirs was literally rice with a few token beans on top.  No gravy.  I don't think they know what red beans and rice is supposed to be.  Green beans were fine.  Cheese and grits were fine.  2 Apps, 2 Entrees (came with 4 sides), and 2 beers: $101.  I would rather have gone to Popeyes.  Actually, as I write this, I'm craving some of Popeyes red beans and rice...  I'll probably get their gumbo to go next time.  That was only $6 or $9 and the best thing they served.  I give them 2.5 stars, but rounded down because of the table thing that annoyed me.,Was looking forward to trying this place but ultimately let down by the food and service. Sat down around 730pm and by 755pm the waiter had not co",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e by to say hi or take our drink order. I got up and looked around for waiter. The hostess saw me get up and kindly took our order. Ordered off the restaurant week menu. Cup of gumbo, salad, fried chicken, and pecan pie cheesecake. Nothing I ate tasted restaurant quality, Chicken was overcooked and skin was flavorless and lacking in texture. Also, they were out of one of the sides I ordered. I replaced it with red beans and rice and very much regretted it when I took my first bite of it. Pecan pie was worst dessert I've had in the City. Having spent $120+ it was a big let down.,Great service, generous management, and delicious food. Highly recommend.,Best beignets in the city - just absolute perfection on light, crispy outside and hollow but gooey inside, topped with powder sugar.,Ordered short rib with the side of cheese grits, 3 fried chickens, 3 oysters, rice, one shrimp po boy with a side of salad, everything was $100 plus $15 tip. Good service. Nice ambiance and good food . It's just Expensive like everything else nowadays.,So there are a lot of aspects that are good - the ambience is great, the decor is nice, and it is extremely clean and inviting. The food however is average and for similar fare Brenda's is far and away a better overall tasting experience. The corn hush puppies were the best thing we had - the remoulade was really tasty and they were pleasantly crunchy. However both the fried chicken and shrimp and grits were under seasoned. The jambalaya had no saucy element and everything was a bit over cooked in general. Sadly, there are better options, especially in the area.,It pains me to leave a not-good review for this restaurant.  The food is tasty and good.  The service is friendly, attentive, helpful.  But the portions were soooo absurdly small.  I ordered the short ribs for $28, excited that it came with two sides.  Like most of the dishes on the menu, it's not cheap.  But this is typical for Cajun/Creole in the Bay; it's a luxury cuisine.  For the sides I ordered jambalaya and collard greens.  What came was a few bites of short ribs, and a couple of tablespoons of jambalaya (mostly seasoned rice) and a pretty tiny cup of collard greens in liquid.  I'm a medium sized male-bodied person, for reference, healthy appetite but not an extreme one.  I left really hungry, as though I'd ordered only an appetizer. If they'd just been a bit more generous with the Jambalaya, I might've overlook the minimized main and other side, having gotten some filling, tasty carbs.I want this restaurant to survive and succeed! There aren't that many New Orleans style restaurants in the Bay, and it's one of my favorite cuisines.  I don't understand their strategy -- are they really cutting that much cost by minimizing the portions?  Is this just me?  Did I order the wrong thing?  It had been a while, but I'd ordered takeout from here before, and don't remember such portion austerity. I was one of the few customers at around 6:30 on a Thursday.  I'm not sure if they're going to make it, which is sad.  But I'd you're charging almost $30/entree, why not at least be generous and make the guest feel well-treated?!,Came for brunch. Had the mushroom scramble with coffee and beignets. My friend got a selection of their sides. All of the food was very delicious. Services was extremely friendly. I'm planning to bring more friends here!,My dad was really jonesing for some creole food - I think he just wanted good southern fried chicken. So when we learned CreoLa was open for Brunch on FRIDAYS too (thanks, Yelp), we decided to drive down from Novato. We were not disappointed.We were seated immediately - arrived about 12:30 with a reservation. The staff is very friendly, got us our drinks and took our orders promptly. Dad and I both ordered the fried chicken with jambalaya on the side - he also got collard greens but I had to do the traditional red beans and rice.The chicken arrived perfectly cooked, the thigh and leg were moist, not overdone a bit. The batter had a dash of spice but not really hot at all. The jambala is amazing, i was pleased it was offered as a side dish, even if it was a five buck upcharge. Well worth it. the sausage was full of great herby flavor, and it brought me right back to New Orleans in the '80s.  Magical. The red beans and rice were completely authentic, and the collard greens had just the right amount of acid, cooked well but not wilted, and disappeared from dad's plate before I could have a second taste.My wife downed the etoufee like it was her last meal. She never even offered me a taste, which says a ton about how much she liked it. She swears it was the best she'd ever had. AND no need to worry about crawfish - they're really in the roux, you're not picking them out of shells so don't worry. every drop on the plate is edible (or my wife ate a bunch of shells and refused to admit it ;).Beignets: Adding rye and a hint of barley flours made these amazingly flavorful. Not just sugary puffs. I recommend highly.With the beignets and coffees, our tab came to just over $100 including tip for the 3 of us. And it was worth every penny.,Great little place to enjoy food wine and SF while waiting for family member having a procedure at UCSF.....love exploring the City,I have had my eye on CreoLa for some time, which I happened upon during some walk or another through the neighborhood, and finally had sat down for a bite here this past week. I developed an affinity for Creole cuisine during my first trip to New Orleans and hadn't had a good representative of such cuisine outside of Louisiana. Until we went here.I'm not sure if it's a rule or a code of life, but if there is crawfish etouffee on the menu, I always order it. However, this precludes me from trying other things on the menu. And so the first thing I liked about CreoLa is that I could order other entrée-type dishes as sides. I did this with the jambalaya. Both were excellent. The shrimp and crawfish in the etouffee were both completely shelled, which I really appreciate because I dislike picking apart seafood. The dish was excellent more generally, a lovely sauce with just a hint of sweetness. The jambalaya was a good counterpart to it, which had a dry heat. I usually don't love andouille sausage, but the sausage in this jambalaya was had a smoky flavor and a pleasantly grainy texture. After wolfing down the etouffee, I deposited the rest of the jambalaya rice on the remains of the etouffee sauce to soak up every last bit. My gf had the fried chicken, which was perhaps the best fried chicken I ever had. It came out piping hot. The brine on the chicken conveyed a nice saltiness and buttermilk glaze both held in chicken's juices and gave the chicken a perfect crispness. CreoLa also had a robust selection of beers from Abita. I had the Wrought Iron IPA, which had lovely herbal notes and paired well with dinner. We ate and drank this buffet of deliciousness seated in the cute and well-spaced outdoor area with swanky jazz playing in the background.,Solid restaurant. Waiter was super attentive and kind. We sat in the upstairs area which was really cute! Had the buttermilk fried chicken. Sides were delicious (collard greens and jambalaya). No complaints at all,Super friendly service, great food, nice atmosphere. The Mushroom Jambalaya and Beignets were a highlight.,First time stopping in and I'm very impressed. I'm from Cajun country and have been dying for a Cajun restaurant in SF. A good one anyways. I ordered a small jambalaya and a side of hush puppies and it was delicious. Really nostalgic and hit all the right notes. Will be back next week to try the étouffée!,The food was sooooo good. Green beans a but salty but the rest so amazing. The hush puppies were unique and I've had hush puppies from up and down the south. We had made a Yelp reservation that didn't allow you to select inside from outside. At least to my knowledge so we were stuck outside and they weren't able to accommodate. Which sucked my parents were visiting from Reno so outside dining was a bit foreign. The service was shit. It took a half hour to get our dessert. They didn't check back in. It took 20 minutes to get a glass of wine. Ridiculous.,We ordered from them during Pandemic and finally were able to go to the restaurant. The food has been consistently awesome.  The fried chicken is soooo delicious!  Other items worth trying are the Mushroom Jambalaya if you are vegan, very flavorful and the collard greens with tasso is super yummy.,Great food. Excellent service.  Gator sausage special was delicious Like the outdoor seating,I've dined here several times and sampled many menu items. All have been unique, tasty and nicely presented. Also a great beer selection! Enjoy!,First time coming here, literally the best southern/New Orleans style food I've ever had! The waiter Julian and Lucas provided us with an amazing experience! I never give out reviews but this place is worth it! The food was unexplainably good!,Made a reservation for weekend lunch and was seated promptly.  Was craving jambalaya and ordered their fried chicken thigh and leg, which were very fresh, nice and hot, crunchy on the outside, juicy on the inside. This dish comes with 2 sides. The grits side was very flavorful and had good texture, the jambalaya side was very flavorful and is more rice based with sausage and bell peppers and not as liquidity as the usual jambalaya. The corn muffin was moist and buttery (usually not a big fan of corn bread but this was so good, craving more). If I am ever craving some good fried chicken, grits, corn muffins, and/or beignets (which were crunchy on the outside, doughy and pillowy on the inside, the caramel sauce was toasty and delectable) I will be back! We scanned a QR code to look at the menu. The interior and furniture are super cute!,I came here with my wife my wife (who happens to be half Creole) after a trip to Free Gold Watch around the corner for our pinball fix.  Great atmosphere and incredibly delicious food!  We were seated promptly, but I'm sad to say we were never offered the free cornbread muffins as starters.  We were starving when we arrived, so it would have been most appreciated, but ah well.  For starters, we ordered a plate of hushpuppies (my personal favorite since childhood), and a pear salad, which had goat cheese (my mortal enemy since childhood).  I tried to be a big boy and endure the goat cheese, but in the end I just couldn't hang.  Luckily, dinner came out quickly and it was magnifique!  My wife had their cornbread catfish with sides of jambalaya and mashed potatoes, while I opted for the fried chicken with sides of red beans & rice and mashed potatoes.  Everything was really nicely prepared, and absolutely delicious.  Despite our huge appetite we left completely full (too full even for the beignets, which looked so good).  Next time my father-in-law is in town, we'll be sure to bring him here for a little taste of home!,So happy friends brought us here for dinner last night.  Fried Chicken, collard greens and red beans and rice hit the spot!   Food was delish and perfect comfort food for a cool SF night.  We picked three dessert items to try them all:  beignets with caramel, bread pudding and  pecan pie with sauce really made were delightful!.  I wished I ordered more beignets to take home.  I heard there is music some nights.  I can't wait to go back with friends.  Make resos.  It fills up quick.   Outdoor dining available.  I hope this place stays in SF forever.,The food is very good here.  Full of flavors and yet relatively light for southern food.  We ordered a shrimp and crawfish etouffee, shrimp and grits, and bread pudding with white chocolate and pecans. Since this is during Covid, they have outdoor seating, and the tables were set fairly far apart. We staff were masks. I can't wait to come back here!,Ooooo weee  good eatin..   I am a picky SouthernerI live next door  been smelling the aroma from the kitchen from my window.. had supper there tonight   By myself   Sat upstairs Had the oysters- the duck gumbo, side of greens and green beans.... service was attentive and friendly Worth every dime I spent!,CreoLa's kitchen is knocking it out of the park, hands down.  As somebody who lived in New Orleans for a bit, I was dubious that SF could do upscale creole food well - but wow.  They outdid New Orleans.  Fried catfish, rice and beans, shrimp etouffee - all delivered with the skill of a Commander's Palace chef.  Even my wife, who was dubious about catfish and southern food generally, thought it was fantastic - everything is a real crowd pleaser and just perfectly executed.Highly recommend.  Don't be thrown off by the sparse decorating or somewhat odd internal layout - this place is serving amazing food.,CreoLA popped up when I was looking for some southern/creole flavors. There have been a number of restaurants opening up in this cuisine category across the city. I would say the success of Brenda's combined with origins of the dishes being affordable & not super labor intensive has spurred this on. Regardless of why, CreoLA is here in SF now and I was rather pleased with the offerings.There are two entrees that I pictured. I was caught up in enjoying the meal and forgot to grab a picture of the refreshing sangria & dessert! Try the sangria de Chicha Morada. don't hesitate. It is a purple corn sangria that isn't too strong & won't ruin the flavor of the food.Back to the food. The first entree ordered was the fried chicken with a side of greens & cream cheese grits. Decided to go with the breast piece, a true test to properly frying chicken imo. It can end up dry or undercooked if not done right. The chicken was cooked just right! Flavor profile was okay. Not seasoned much but also not bland. Grits were cooked perfect, you really can mess them up but not here. The greens were pretty good but nothing special. All in all it was a solid meal that I was happy about.I am a huge fan of seafood so I had to go with a stable and try the cornmeal crusted catfish. Sides were the Cajun jambalaya & green beans. The catfish will be my go to when I come back. I'm really interested in the catfish poboy now. The catfish wasn't oily, the fry was solid and was overall pretty tasty. It paired really well with the jambalaya. Since I had got the greens for the chicken, I opted for the green beans. Nothing special with the green beans, but the Cajun jambalaya deserves its own entree spot. The stock it's cooked in provides a great flavor and the rice isn't under or over cooked. For dessert I went for both options. The beignets were solid, not too chewy, not too tough, & the salted caramel they come with was the favorite of the evening. Wanted to ask for some to go honestly. The bread pudding was also really tasty. I am a sucker for desserts and hate when you order one just to be left unsatisfied. Not the case here! Was the cherry on top of a great meal.The presentation of each dish was well done. The portions are pretty typical for here in Frisco. Places are trying to survive, especially with delivery services charging so much, so the prices weren't an issue at all. Service was great, the outdoor seating is insta worthy and you can't go wrong picking this place. I'll be back for sure to try more food!Cheers!,This place is so underrated and so freaking delicious! STAFF: The staff was super friendly and our waitress was very attentive (To the waitress: thank you for letting us use your doggy water bowl ). SEATING: Due to COVID, they have a lot of outdoor seating and it was shady. FOOD: We ordered the gumbo, shrimp and grits, and the shrimp po boy! -The gumbo was flavorful, delicious, not heavy, and well balanced. 10/10 would order again! -The Shrimp & Grits was soooo good! Not heavy, broth was packed with flavor, shrimp was perfectly cooked, the additional veges/sausage complimented the dish. 10/10 would order again!-The Shrimp po boy was pretty nice. All I can say is that it's good for a po boy in CA. 7.5/10 OVERALL: I would come again! There's so much love put into crafting these delicate dishes and I can feel it. I highly recommend checking this place out.,We had blacked catfish with 2 sides: rice and beans, and Jambalaya. My husband had shrimp etouffe. Everything was so delicious! The jambalaya was smoky and complex. The catfish, shrimp, and crawfish was juicy. The etouffe got the sweetness from the crawfish and was no too heavy at all. Everything was just right. The service was great. We will definitely come back. Highly recommended!,So I was so excited to visit this restaurant after reading all the stellar reviews.  We were a group of four and we arrived on time for our 8:30 reservation.  We were seated promptly,  with a terrific view of the street.  It's a very cute restaurant with the charm of New Orleans.  The space was chilly because they had a back door open and it was windy and cold outside, but it's SF in a post-pandemic world. The menu looked amazing and we had a hard time deciding what to choose from because there were so many wonderful looking dishes.  Our waiter seemed helpful, at first.  However he didn't take a drink order.   Once we asked if we could order wine/beer, he did let us order beverages along with several appetizers (hush puppies," boudin balls and gumbo) for the group to share.  We then tried to ask him what was good on the menu and his response was """"the food"""". We tried to chat with him to get a sense of what would be good choices for us to order", but he wasn't willing to have a conversation about the food.  He brought us our drinks, then took our orders.  The appetizers we order never arrived.  We were later told that they were delivered to another table. (All 3 of them ?!?)  On the plus side, our entrees were very tasty.  Two of us had fried chicken, one had catfish and the fourth had short ribs.  We all loved our meals.  However,  the side dishes ordered by one of my table mates was incorrect so that needed to be fixed.   The appetizers that didn't arrive were removed from our bill and they comped us a dessert.   However, the bill was incorrect in that they charged us to bring the correct side dish for my table mate. That was taken care of.   The manager was helpful in getting that taken care of, but he seemed anxious for us to leave.It seemed that the were in a hurry to close (which I get), but we were respectful and didn't languish after we finished our food.  We departed at 9:35, 1/2 hour after closing.  There were still people dining after we left.  I'm tempted to go back and give it another try, but there are so many restaurants in The City that seem to want our business more, that I don't know if I'll give it another shot.  If I were to create categories for this review, I would say food 5, service 2.,While the food was quite good, the staff left a lot to be desired. Though not particularly crowded, the waitstaff was more interested in socializing than working. The waiter handed us our menus and immediately asked us if we'd like something to drink or some appetizers before we had a chance to settle in and review the menu. Finally, we ordered an appetizer and some entrees. All of a sudden there was a great deal of noise coming from in front of the kitchen. Several f-bombs were dropped in the casual but overly loud conversation. Our bottled water was brought by the waiter who unscrewed the caps with his bare hands while his mask was not covering his nose. Our meals came after a long wait. They forgot the appetizer so I told them to forget it. Instead, the manager brought the appetizer with an apology and no charge. The main courses were quite good and were accompanied by two traditional New Orleans of one's choice. The fried chicken is very good, as were the green beans and red beans and rice. The blackened chicken was also good. When it came to dessert, we ordered the beignets and coffee. The waiter brought the coffee to the table, but when we asked for milk, he informed us that they had run out. One of our party doesn't drink coffee without cream, so that was a disappointment. The odd thing is that there is a corner market directly across from the restaurant where they could have easily purchased a container of milk. Good staff is hard to find in these times, but competent people would be acceptable too. It is a shame because the food is really quite good, hence the four stars.,Where do I begin. After we were seated outdoors, we were told water would be right out, and they would turn on the heater. Our server then disappeared for 25 minutes, until I flagged down a busser and asked him to get us some water. At this point we were more than ready to place our order, and did so along with our drinks. It took another 15 minutes until we got our drinks, all the while our heater was still not working. When we got our hush puppies, we asked if they could move a heater from another table, and our server was reluctant to do so, but eventually did. Unfortunately were already chilled to the bones, and the heat was fairly weak. It had been over an hour until we finally got our entrees, when I unfortunately got the meat jambalaya. However I am allergic to shrimp, and explicitly ordered the vegan one. I asked to send it back as I was unable to eat it, and since we were so hungry, I didn't have another hour to wait for the kitchen to cook the the tofu version. At this point, we cut our losses, and went to Whole Foods down the street for some pizza and ice cream instead. Also, I have to ask, why is the Sf restaurant week pricing more expensive? We only came here because it was apparently, as our server put," """"quite a good deal", but when I added up everything, the majority of the combinations were, in fact, cheaper. Will not recommend or come here again.,Wonderful chicken and even better short ribs! Really nice interior and atmosphere. Had a great time.,I keep driving by this place," each time saying """"I gotta go here.""""  Tonight was the night -- finally!  Greeted warmly by the host (who asked to check our id's and proof of vaccination -- thank you!).  We were a group of 4.  Our waiter - John - was super friendly and attentive.  Given that each of us cleaned off our plate", I'd say this place is a hit, and return visits are in the plans.  I ate the Blackened Catfish (tasty with a little kick of spice) with two sides -- the creamy and luscious cream cheese grits and the al dente green beans with shaved garlic.  My dining partners enjoyed the Seafood Gumbo and Pear Salad to start, with entrees -- Fried Chicken, Shrimp Etouffee, and Cornmeal Crusted Catfish.  One does not say 'no' to their desserts -- Beignets and Bread Pudding.,I grew up in Baton Rouge but have lived in SF for over 25 years, always lamenting the lack of good Louisiana food (and the freezing summers!). But lo and behold, CreoLa snuck in under the radar, opening at the toughest time--right before the pandemic hit. And it's the best I've had here. Rivals anything in NOLA! Just delicious.We started with some a pile of seasonal crawfish. Spiced perfectly. I had the crispy fried chicken with collards and red beans and rice. My friends had the jambalaya with tender, juicy chicken on top and the delicious etouffée. Boudin balls, creamy and crispy. Nice service. Literally zero complaints. Only accolades. It was a cold night last night and they weren't busy enough. Please support them! I need them to stick around. It's a tough world for small business owners right now--particularly restaurants.,Salty food Super slow service waited 20 minutes before a drink Not a friendly waiter,Delicious quality service and great waiters. Food takes a long time to come out but to me it was worth the wait! Was with a friend who has roots to NOLA and said they did a great job. I live down the street here and it is certain that I will be returning here,Service - the lady was friend but she mistook our shrimp and grits for the shrimp dish below. Drinks - we ordered mimosas and she made them STRONG! Dessert - save it for the end and get the 6 piece beignet. They were okay, but still with it.,Decided to stop by this new spot with my partner to have dinner. The food was really tasty and our server was amazing. Pricing is a little on the higher side but this is San Francisco. I noticed the gentleman (not sure if it's the owner or head chef) was saying goodbye to this group of people and was asking them about the restaurant. The restaurant was empty and it was only us at our table, he didn't stop to ask us what we thought about the food and restaurant and I personally felt that he wasn't really personable or maybe we didn't fit the classy criteria that this restaurant is going for. We eat out almost every day in the city, every new restaurant of that size, usually the owner will come and talk to us to see what we thought and gives it a personal welcoming feeling. I might be overthinking it but I just find it a bit unwelcoming," especially knowing this restaurant took over a neighborhood icon """"Bangkok 900"""" Thai restaurant. I'm all for a good restaurant taking over if they can offer good food. Service is most important thing especially when you're new and trying to """"make it"""" here in San Francisco. This won't stop us from visiting in the near feature as I stated before that the food is really tasty but hopefully they make this into a more Welcoming Establishment", that's what southern comfort is all about.,What a cute little restaurant by the Golden Gate Park. Nice interior, and enough seatings. We went around brunch time so wasn't that crowded. They offer a brunch special and a regular menu. The Gumbo and Beignets ( with salted caramel sauce on the side :D ) were superb !!! Didn't expect them to be that amazing. Will come by again next time we run at the park.,THE  GUMBO!! I grew up on the Gulf Coast and this is the first gumbo I've found on the West Coast that is what it should be. Rich, flavorful, and the ingredients are well prepared. Also, the beignets are way better than Brenda's. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu!,It was fine and decently tasty, but nothing to write home about. I'd probably come back to try more things simply because I live nearby, though not cheap enough to do it often. Nice to have more variety in the neighborhood though and service was good.- Hush puppies came with some crab and overall had good texture and flavor. - Fried chicken needed something else - we had to request hot sauce because it was a bit bland. The breading was fine, but honestly would prefer Popeye's. Collard greens were fantastic. The plate needs one more side though, like a black eyed peas or macaroni and cheese or a biscuit. It's a bit small and lacks variety for $23. - Beignets were tasty, but it's hard to go wrong with a warm donut with powdered sugar. Size was inconsistent and made it feel like state fair food instead of a dessert order at a restaurant.,I did not like the shrimp n gritts they had too much of some wierd spice in them. Ill stick to brendas soul food in sf for my killer shrimp n grits.,Beautiful restaurant inside! Cute decor and fresh flowers at front/candles are a nice touch.I really liked my waitress! She was the best!! (Thai girl, I think) I hope we can dine in soon after quarantine.Food is tasty and has that homemade feeling. Fried chicken is really crispy. Portions are small, I'm always hungry after I leave. The cost is pretty pricy for a weekly/after work dinner. I would only Dine in, to experience the ambiance and music. I ordered a to go combo pack, (chicken, greens, beignets and those ball things) portions seemed really small. If the plates were bigger and cheaper I would prob takeout at least once or twice a week. Now CreoLa is just a neighborhood date spot. I'll walk to 9th ave for some cheaper to go bites.,Super yummy food. The best southern place we have tried in SF. Better than front porch. Julian the waiter delivered flawless and attentive service. Impressed. Coming back soon.,So excited for a new restaurant in the neighborhood! We went there for dinner on Valentine's day and the place was pleasantly poppin. Pros:- Good atmosphere: I love a place with minimal/tasteful decor and maximum food/service quality.- Beer selection was nice: I got the Saison and the bf got the Wrought Iron IPA. Both were delish.- Food was very tasty: Can't go wrong with some good shrimp & grits and boy were these tasty. Beignets were heavenly. Boudin balls were excellent.- Lighting upstairs was great: dimly lit, but I could still read my menu. Cons:- Lighting downstairs was a little bright.- Food could have been a bit spicier.- No hard liquor...yet(?)Overall great addition to the neighborhood. Excited to go again.,We had food from here twice - Once our friends brought it over the second time we did pick up. Sorry - no pics because both times we devoured the food too quickly. The fried chicken is absolutely the best! Crispy and flavorful skin, and super juicy! Makes my mouth water just thinking about it. The shrimp and grits is my second favorite here..and all the sides are great!We had a bit of a hiccup with our pick up order - which is expected from a newish restaurant. I recommend that you double check your order before leaving especially if you are driving a ways.,I used to live in San Francisco and was delighted to see that this gorgeous restaurant opened in Cole Valley.   was enjoying a solo trip, so I made a reservation to dine alone in the outdoor patio area.  From what I could see, the interior of the space is beautiful, and I look forward to the day when I can visit again and sit inside once the pandemic is over.  I also look forward to exploring the wine list,  which I didn't get a chance to do because I was too busy enjoying the yummy craft cocktails.  I enjoy traveling and dining alone.  At CeoLA, the service was so fantastic, I wasn't alone for long.  I was waited on by Edwin, the Chef Owner.  I loved the fact that he didn't blink an eye when I ordered way too much food for one person, and pretty much dusted all of it.  In my defense, I hadn't eaten since lunch and did a lot of walking around all day, but I pretty much pigged out on everything because it was so delicious.  At the end, I was glad I tried everything I did, and wished I had more time to go back for more.  I started with a lime Moscow Mule and okra.  Okra is one of my favorite foods, especially when it's fried.  Often times, it's cut up and fried in a heavy batter, which is okay.  At CreoLa, Chef slices whole pieces open in a flower shape and batters it delicately with clever spices, making it perfect to pick up and eat with my hands. After devouring my appetizer, I moved on to the sangria, and I figured I better eat some greens, so I ordered a sweet butter lettuce salad.  Even this simple dish stood out as unique and thoughtfully prepared. As I ate my sumptuous gumbo entree, Chef Edwin entertained me by answering all of my questions with genuine humor and pride in his craft.  It was from Edwin I learned that Creole food was also a staple in the Dominican Republic, where his mother came from.  Chef is a long time Bay Area resident, and we traded stories about both working in flagship San Francisco restaurants in the 90's.  Chef is one of the most friendly and interesting people I've had the pleasure of meeting. He surfs, and  also has a CreoLa location in San Carlos. He just smiled as I took down an entire plate of the best beignets I've ever tasted, and another sangria for desert.  I left CreoLa, full and happy.  I can't wait to visit again.,Their fried chicken is full of flavor, and crispy skin and I love that I get to pick dark meat.Last night I had my favorite chicken again, and was surprised to find corn bread.My wife got the etouffe, with mashed potatoes and asparagus sides  I had to steal some from her plate.We live close by with a bunch of options, but I keep on going back to Creola!,"I love this place! I got Seafood Gumbo and I love it! Rich flavored and full of ingredients. Totally recommended. We ordered fried chicken and it is ok too. The service was also very good.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
