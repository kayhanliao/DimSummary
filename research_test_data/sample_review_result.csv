0,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,"KOREAN-THAI, KOTHAI! It has a nice ring to it. January 28, 2023 - Date night. When Kothai popped up on my yelp account, I knew I had to try it.Honestly, I wanted to order everything on the menu. I wanted to indulge in the world of Korean and Thai mixed together. As a half Chinese and half Korean breed, I've tried plenty of Korean/Chinese cuisines. Never had I ever had Korean and Thai infused together. It my brain, it already made perfect sense because I LOVE spicy. I cannot eat a meal and feel satisfied without having high level of spiciness. So you can already feel how excited I was when 2 culinary countries known for spiciness and flavor come together. ECSTATIC!Thai Crudo was pretty impressive. It was their take on a papaya salad. I didn't know Hamachi will compliment papayas well. It worked! The flavors were very soft, not overly seasoned. It made this appetizer truly appetizing. It was the perfect starter to get our appetite's wet. Beets and pear salad was so refreshing! They were not stingy with the amount of beets and juicy pears they served. Husband is not about veggies, but he kept going for seconds and thirds. Korean BBQ Steak with their ""garbage"" sauce is a must. My goodness! The steak itself was prepared med-rare and it was super-juicy-super-tender-super-duper-yummilicious! I've had my share of Hamachi Kama. But the way KOTHAI prepared it was phenomenal. It was a burst of flavors that tingled my taste buds. The breadcrumbs were crunchy. creamy and acidic. The broccoli rabe added bitterness and pepperiness to balance the breadcrumbs. And when eaten with the hamachi, it's like a firework in your mouth. As I'm writing this review, my mouth is getting watery. My least favorite was the Tom Yum. The rice noodles were over cooked that it was slimy. But that's okay, some people might like that. I'll have to go back to try their beef noodle soup in hopes that it'll be more enjoyable. Thai Tea - MUST GET! Strong, creamy and not too sweet. It's my kind of style. I'm sensitive to caffeine so I was up jittery all night, but so worth it! It's the best Thai tea I've ever had. In a world where boba/thai tea drinks are life, finding my favorite Thai tea spot is a true gem. Service was slow at first. We had to wait a while to order, but once the order was made, it was smooth sailin'. The owner (Korean) served most of our dishes and he seemed so personable. He engaged in conversation with us which really made us feel welcomed. He also expressed his gratitude to us for trying his restaurant. It was refreshing to be acknowledged because many places nowadays lack this form of hospitality. There's several more dishes that I want to try so we'll definitely be back! Oh~ I can't wait. Welcome to SF KOTHAI! You've settled in the most perfect place, a city that's always cold, your dishes will bring such warmth to our souls.",34
1,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,"I heard about this Thai/Korean fusion restaurant that opened up recently and I just had to try it. I came here to eat lunch with a friend and both of us enjoyed the meal. We did order a little bit too much and did end up having to take some food back home.The three things we ordered:- korean spicy noodles with pork- tom yum noodle soup with small rice noodles- bibimbap (not pictured)We also ordered their thai tea and their lavender coffee. For me personally, I thought the thai tea was too sweet for me. I would have preferred if there was less sugar in the tea. The korean spicy noodles were great! It had a great amount of flavor and I would order this again. The bibimbap was also delicious. The server came up to me and recommended us to eat the meat with their green sauce and that was delicious! Make sure you try their green sauce that they will provide to you. Lastly, the tom yum noodle soup tasted a little bit different from what I am used to. This wasn't my favorite dish out of the three, but it was still good. Overall, I would come back again to try their dishes. The service was great as well, and the interior was really pretty. This place is definitely a good spot for a date night or for a casual lunch or dinner with friends.",34
2,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,"Great dishes and execution. I loved the Tom Yum, grilled fish and Korean noodles. The food was fantastic and gave me and my partner positive moodletts for the times we went. Pro-tip: It's not on the menu but the cheesecake is amazing.",34
3,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,"Kothai Republic has so much potential and I can foresee that if they tweak their dishes just a bit, this place can exceed expectations. Came here on a Tuesday and there was no one in the restaurant but my boyfriend and I were enticed but the pictures so we decided to give it a try.Waitress was amiable, quick and efficient and made sure we were checked up on constantly. The food, on the other hand, was of high quality ingredients but I didn't really care much for the execution of the dishes. The pear and beet salad was a strange combo and the sweetness of the pears overwhelmed the overall crisp salad which I personally could not palate. The beef noodle soup was delicious but the broth was overly salty for me. The beef was tender and juicy and made up for the broth. The noodles were cooked to perfection and was able to withhold Â the flavors the broth well.Overall, I do see this place taking off in the near future.",34
4,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,"Food truck turned brick and mortar. Still definitely working out the flow (saw our food pass our table twice, return to the kitchen to check which table and then brought to our table hahaha) but overall very well ran kitchen with great food. Would've tweaked a few things about the food but overall would give them a 4.5/5Ambiance: 4/5 smallish open seating area that is simple and clean. beautiful plates! Definitely be prepared to wait if you arrive 7p or later on a weekend night. Service: 5/5 staff was prompt and made sure our glasses were never empty.Food: Kimchi fried rice balls: 5/5 really nice texture. Mayo sauce on top was Yumm. Korean noodle: 5/5 would def order this again. They subbed the chicken out with pork and the pork was perfectly cooked and the sauce on it was the right amount of umami. It was paired with a refreshing cabbage slaw and the noodles were seasoned perfectly. Tom yum: 5/5 probably not your typically Tom yum but oh so yummy. Def more creamy than I'm used to but it was really good. Portion size is generous. The pork in mine was a little firm but the shrimp were JUICY and THICCCC. Spice was just right as well. The noodles do really soak up the soup though so would recommend splitting this if you don't eat a lot - wouldn't recommend taking this home for leftovers. Would def order this again. Beef noodle soup: 5/5 again not the typical BNS - the noodles are more like vermicelli/rice?? Not the egg noodle I'm used to. Almost had a pho like spin on the broth as well. But the add in spice sauce was fire and the meat was TENDER in this soup. Same comment as the Tom yum- finish it here; won't go home we'll. Chicken noodle: 3/5 chicken itself was really tender and good. Noodles were cooked well but a little bland. They come with a mushroom sauce which I didn't feel like it added much to the dish. I would love to see this dish with garlic noodle instead ! Overall definitely a place I will come back to!",34
5,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,"Amazing. Will 100% come back again!! The food was exactly what we were looking for. Tom Yum Soup- Our favorite of the night!! It had fried pork skins in it that added such a nice savory crunch to the soup. The flavor of the soup was rich and complex, not too sour, and not too sweet. Kimchi Rice Balls- We reallyyy enjoyed these!! The crispy exterior with the mayo sauce and savory kimchi fried rice was a good combo. Korean noodle- awesome. I'm Korean, and I definitely know I had something like this before so it reminded me of mom's cooking and still tasted really good. They substituted it with pork on the menu this night, and it paired really well with the fried rice. Chicken Noodle- The chicken in this dish was really good good. Super moist and tender chicken that fell off the bone. The noodle wasn't as flavorful as I hoped, but it was fried well. Beef Noodle Soup- My friend got the beef noodle soup and he loved it! The Thai iced tea was to die for, all of my friends are milk tea fans and this one had great proportions of cream and tea. The service was also pretty good. They were so friendly and quickly and kindly accommodated any requests, and made sure to keep filling our waters. I'll be back for sure!!! So happy to find such a great place!! My only recommendation is to come earlier rather than later, since it fills up at around 7pm!",34
6,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,"We went at 6pm on a Friday night and was immediately seated. It's good to go early because it was a full house by the time we left, with people waiting at the front and outside. It was the two of us and we ordered three items: peer and beet salad, hamachi, and tom yum noodle soup. I thought I would need dessert after but we were full at the end. Our eyes eat first and Kothai beautifully presented all their dishes. The salad started my appetite with the delicious taste of feta cheese and picked onions. In contrast, the pears and beets were light and refreshing, a great combo! I would reorder this dish. Hamachi seafood dish came out the same time as our salad. Again, a feast to our eyes. The skin was perfectly crispy and the inside was tender. No need to add lemon as the chefs have already done that for you. Don't forget the broccolini with the crunchy breadcrumbs. Tasty! I would recommend a bowl of white rice to complement all the flavor.Finally, after conversing for a while, the Tom Yum noodle soup, came out. The soup isn't like the normal soup at Thai restaurants like Banana Island. I would liken it to ramen soup which is thicker. Surprisingly, it was still light to the taste. The bean sprouts and crispy skin toppings provided texture to the noodles. Yummy! It's been awhile since I gave a 5 star review, but this is one of them. Service was a bit slow but they are still new and it was a Friday night. Viet Gao has a competitor on the block!",34
7,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,"Possibly closer to a 3.5 than 4, but since it's a new restaurant and I've only tried 2 items I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.I was super excited when I saw this place opened and it's a fusion of two of my favorite cuisines, Thai and Korean. The interior is super bright and modern, and street parking was relatively easy to find on a weekday at lunch time. There was no wait so we were immediately seated. The waitress bought over the menus and immediately asked me if we wanted water or hot tea. Maybe I should've known better than to assume since it's SF, but since it's partially a Korean restaurant I assumed hot tea would be free but was surprised after I ordered and actually had time to look at menu that it was $5.We ordered the tom yum soup upon recommendation by one of the staff members, and the Korean Spicy Noodle. The dishes were beautifully presented and we were super excited to taste it. We really enjoyed the Tom yum noodle soup; it had a nice kick and was flavorful. Unfortunately we did not enjoy the Korean Spicy Noodle (non-vegan version) dish anywhere near as much. The crispy chicken as mentioned on the menu actually came in the form of a fried chicken ball that just did not work for me. It seemed to have a very strong curry/lentil flavor mixed with shredded chicken that just did not pair well with the dish in my opinion. The noodles themselves were alright, nothing spectacular.I do hope to come by again in the future and try some of their other dishes as I do think there's quite a few unique items they have that I have yet to try!",34
8,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,We saw this new restaurant the other day while walking and decided to return to try. The restaurant is lovely with wonderful bright lighting from the windows and stylish furniture. Their liquor license is pending but that wasn't an issue for us as we tried the Thai iced tea which was really good. It tasted the way Thai iced tea should. Hubby and I really liked the bibimbap. Tasty and even more Unami when you add the sauce on the side. I would order this dish again. The Tom yum soup was good and I really liked the rice noodles and 3 pieces of roast pork (gimme more!) but it was too spicy for me. We ate the dish and left some of the soup behind. The wait staff was also very nice. We sat near the kitchen staff window and were able to see the busy staff at work. Such a nice place. Menu is limited but we plan to return to sample some of the other dishes.,34
9,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,"Great new addition to Inner Sunset. Overall a great experience but since they're new want to post some feedback on what could be improved. The meats were very good, especially the skirt steak galbi special they served the night my friends and I went (would recommend bringing that into the default menu!). Biggest area of improvement were the noodles. The noodles tended to be very bland, especially the chicken noodles. I'd consider mixing the sauce into it instead of having it plated separately. The kimchi noodles were definitely a bit better flavored. This is more opinionated but I would have preferred more of the kimchi spice to shine but instead I got a lot of gochujang flavor.",34
10,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,"I'm so excited to have this amazing restaurant in the neighborhood. For now it's easy to walk in, but I'm sure people will catch on. The soups were very tasty- broths were complex, lots of noodles and textures. I'm not sure which one I liked more. Â They were perfect for a cold night.",34
11,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,"For dine in on Tuesday, January 10, 2023The restaurant would be closing in 50 minutes for the afternoon when we left the hospital for lunch. My sister asked for recommendations because it was our first time eating there. I had intended to order chicken noodle and was disappointed that it wasn't available. For starters, we went with the popular Kimchi Rice Balls. I chose the Bibimbap and my sister, the Beef Noodle Soup.It was very clean in the restaurant and we were able to see the chefs cooking in the kitchen.The Kimchi Rice Balls had a crunchy exterior and plenty of flavor. The beef noodle had 2 big pieces of beef shank, on choy, and crispy pork rinds. My Bibimbap had beef cubes, sliced shitake mushrooms, sprouts, baby carrots, zucchini rolls, radish kimchi, and a soft egg not overly runny. There was flavor already and I found myself only putting dabs of accompanying sauce for extra flavor.We had enjoyed our little adventure out to try a restaurant near the hospital and the storm had held. It was time to go back to the hospital.",34
12,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,"A spot worth trying with an explosion of flavors!O R D E R E D- pears & beets- hamachi crudo- korean spicy noodle- chicken toast- hamachi kama- chicken noodle- beef noodle soupV E R D I C TIf you haven't tried out Kothai, you are missing out! They have the perfect spot for lunch with their open window / open kitchen interior and you have so much light that comes in to keep you warm and your food looking bright. All of their dishes hit the spot in the flavor department, as well as being photogenic. The Kothai team puts their own spin on some staple dishes, as well as some they created on their own. They put a mix of Korean and Thai flavors and spices that won't leave you disappointed. I don't have a favorite dish because Â everything was delicious - I will saw the pears and beet salad did blow my taste buds away as soon as I tasted it. Everything was so fresh and portion sizes were perfect with some extra to take home for later. You can taste all the effort the team puts into each dish and how everything brings the flavors all together. Parking would be either residential or in the public lot at the end of the block near Irving and 9th. They are located RIGHT on the corner or Judah and 9th. They're great for both dinner and lunch, see you soon!",34
13,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,"In the past 2 weeks, we've been here 3 times. Yes, it's that good. It's comfort food with a pleasant twist. My favs so far are the chicken noodles (dry style) and apple cheesecake (not on the menu but GET IT). The flavors, textures, and presentation are so carefully curated and thought out. These guys are passionate about their craft and it shows. One of the owners (Hi Sung!) genuinely cares about what you think and will take any critique into consideration to try to make their food even better...which is hard to find nowadays, especially when you've been in the food industry for as long as he has. Oh yeah, and it's BYOB! Come give it a try before it gets too popular and busy!",34
14,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,My partner and I were really excited to try this new restaurant in the neighborhood! This Korean/Thai fusion food truck-turned-restaurant is a wonderful addition to the inner sunset. Service was great and super friendly. The interior is clean and minimal with beautiful plate ware. We loved the beef noodle soup and the Korean spicy noodle dishes! We're glad we came in and can't wait to try other dishes next time :),34
15,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,We stumbled unto Kothai Republic. Just come check out their beef noodle soup. Say no more.The cleanliness of the space and open ambiance brought us in but the taste and quality made us return two days in a row. They're also super friendly and with a mission. It's unbeatable at the price point. We've been to literally all restaurants in the neighborhood and we are very excited for Kothai Republic. Taste: Quality: Ambiance:,34
16,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,Nicely decorated and good service! The restaurant is within walking distance of Golden Gate Park. Dishes were beautifully presented and excellent balance of spice and flavor. Good portions - we walked out full! Forgot to take pic of arugula salad with pear and toasted coconut - refreshing and dilling. I squeezed a lime on the Tom Yum soup and was very happy.,34
17,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,"Everything was so good! Brought a few friends and was able to try literally everything. Perfect date night place too, not too expensive with Michelin like plating and nice ambiance (^u^)",34
18,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,We were a party of 3. We shared appetizers and each ordered an entree. Me and one friend do not like cheese so they were kind enough to put the feta cheese on the side for the person that likes cheese.Some up us cannot handle spicy so they were able to accommodate us. Everything was delicious. We would definitely go back again. All of us said our entree meats were cooked to perfection: so moist and tender.,34
19,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,Solid place! We had the Tom Yum and the Beef Noodle soup. Delicious :)The staff are extremely friendly and the atmosphere is super chill. You can tell they staff are very passionate about customer service.,34
20,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,"Shiny, new, very inviting setup. The owners seem like family and are very, very happy to see you. This was really pleasant. The food is tasty-- I had the kimchi rice balls and the Tom yum soup. The soup is AMAZING. I will definitely come back for it. It was packed full of proteins and I don't think I've ever had better prepared giant shrimp in a soup. Shrimp are so easy to overlook, but these were tail free, enormous, and perfectly cooked so they weren't tough or rubbery. And it was incredibly filling. I'd come back again and again just for the soup alone!",34
21,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,"Best new addition to the Inner Sunset's 9th Avenue corridor. A small, focused menu brings out incredible flavors. Best tom yum I've ever had. As the family will tell you, they take the time every day to create their own shrimp stock, a detail which matters when it comes to depth of flavor. Everything else we ordered was elevated without ostentatiousness, well-portioned, and satisfying. Can't wait to go back.A warm, welcoming, bright space, Kothai Republic has that undeniable feel of a new restaurant in SF which (if we're all very lucky) will grow to be an iconic neighborhood spot.",34
22,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,My first time at Kothai - I went for lunch and had the beef noodle soup - really enjoyed it!Broth was tasty and all ingredients looked fresh and good - looks like a lot of care is put into the cooking. I am glad that we have such a special addition to the neighborhood and hope they will keep up the good work - we needed such a restaurant.I'll be back for more - thank you!,34
23,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,"Highly recommend this wonderful new spot! Flavors and seasoning were bright, crisp with fresh herbs. Unique combination of Thai and Korean - can't believe haven't tried before! Wasn't too garlic forward which suits our palette. Recommendations - hamachi collar, spicy Korean noodles (the meat is an extra delicious surprise.) Â swing by arzemendi for a sweet cookie after!",34
24,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,"Kothai Republic is a welcomed new addition to the great food scene in the Inner Sunset. Clean, minimal aesthetic inside lends itself well to a either date night or a casual night out with friends. For dinner, we had the beef noodle soup and bibimbap. The soup had a great, rich broth and super yummy braised brisket. The bibimbap had super fresh vegetables and was a sizable portion for around $18. For an appetizer, we ordered the kimchi rice balls which had a panko-type crust on the outside, filled with kimchi, fried rice, and bacon on the inside. My only feedback is that I wish there were 3 kimchi rice balls instead of two - they were awesome, and awe would have loved to have split a third one! Service was great and attentive as well. Overall super positive dining experience, I will be back!",34
25,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,Small mix of Korean and Thai selections. Â Very good tom yum and other items are tasty as well.The space is comfortable and a good addition to the neighborhood.I look forward to my next visit.,34
26,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,"Loved all the food, especially the pear and beet salad. The space has a nice clean design with lots of natural light and the service was great. I can't eat gluten and they explained which dishes are GF and which can be altered to make them GF. We'll be going back soon!",34
27,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,Really nice new restaurant on 9th with great Korean food! The staff were very kind and gave us a free appetizer. The Korean spicy noodle was fantastic!,34
28,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,KP was outstanding! The food was delicious and service impeccable. Shared the Asian pear/ beet salad and bibimbap braised beef. Dishes were beautifully presented and cuisine outstanding. I would go back again and again.,34
29,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,"Tom yum soup is a must try if you enjoy a kick of spiciness in the broth, it's hearty with intense shrimp flavor, and probably boiled in high heat for a long period of time. Kimchi is super fresh, as you bite into the leafy cabbage, the crunch of will ignite the nostalgia of hometown cooking. A dish I will order again. It's a great addition to the neighborhood.",34
30,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,This restaurant has a small menu but the food is different but Â very tasty .Healthy and thought out.Give this place a try.Fusion Asian food.Servers are nice and helpful.Refilled our hot water. Checked on us many times.We went for lunch.I had the Bimbibop. I substituted for chicken.They gave me a chicken leg. So tender.My friend had the beef noodle soup. She was very satisfied,34
31,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,"Amazing new family-run restaurant! Super delicious flavors (we had the crispy pork, bibimbap, noodle soup and wish we had room for more), friendly service, lovely modern space, nice ambiance. Excellent portion sizes and prices.",34
32,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,Outstanding food made with attention and love. Â Front of the house staff is friendly and informative and the kitchen staff pays attention to every detail. Â I came here for lunch with two friends and all three of us were blown away. Â This is a family operation and we're going do our part to make sure they are successful! Â Don't miss the skirt steak!,34
33,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,"Creative and tasty menu! The beef stew tasted amazing, and the Bibimbap bowl was hearty. Vegetables were flavorful and substantial. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Definitely will be coming here again.",34
34,s2R3RUJ09eBFvHVIUS4Shg,Kothai Republic,5.0,One of the best restaurants I have eaten at in the sunset districts. Each food item was immaculate with an abundance of flavors in every single bite. The owner was amazing and created a fantastic menu. Highly recommend this place.,34
