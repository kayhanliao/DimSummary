HOW TO MAKE GIT BRANCHES 


1. Git branch (check if git branch is main)
2. Git checkout -b ##BRANCHNAME
3. Use git normally 
4. When your gonna commit stuff write git push ## BRANCHNAME and whatever   
5. 

Why are we doing this? 
Because we should be workin in parallel and we might have conflicts or w.e so if u push and pull at diff times shit breaks u know. Also its good practice
