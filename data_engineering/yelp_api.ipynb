I recommend using the Yelp waitlist so you can explore things in the area just in case it's full! <br/><br/>We ordered the Daeho Suyuk Royal Brisket, and it was huge! It was a brisket in a broth with mushrooms and (I think?) green onions on top. There was a lot of meat, and they gave sides like kimchi and seasame oil (if you ask) so you can add some more flavor.<br/><br/>If I'd come again I would try the bibimbap and kalbijimm, seeing it on other peoples tables looked really tasty!</span></p>,\n",

I got the spicy beef rib soup, and it came with a half-centimeter layer of oil on top. I had to spoon out all the oil before it became remotely edible. I'd never seen so much oil in a Korean soup before: it filled one of the banchan sections. The flavor was fine but a bit too spicy; at the end I couldn't finish the soup because the bottom was so concentrated with pepper flakes. <br/><br/>Maybe it's just not for me, but if you love super hot and super oily, the spicy beef rib soup would be a great fit for you. It's just not something I would personally ever want to eat again.</span></p>,\n",

The 3-4 portion kalbijjim came with 3 bowls of rice to which you can chose from either purple or white rice. <br/><br/>The meat was fall off the bone tender and seasoned so well! All the fixings, potatoes, and onions over rice made for a delicious bite. The bibimbap also came with a bunch a vegetables to help balance the heavy meal which served as a nice break.

It's comfort food at it's finest and perfect for a cold SF night. The serving size without the extra meat was probably good for 4 medium sized appetites, so we ended up with a good amount of leftovers.<br/><br/>The galbijjim was as good as I remembered it, but definitely a lot more expensive. However, I do believe you can't put a price on good food, and if you really want something and it lives up to the hype, then it's worth every dim. Plus, it's a dish that I'll never be able to make on my own. <br/><br/>I hadn't been here in a while and I forgot that you had to order before you sat down. So when you name gets called, have your order ready, and be prepared to wait an additional 20-30 minutes before you get to your table. The waitlist you have to do in-person, and can't be done via the app, which is a bummer. <br/><br/>The wait on a Saturday was quoted at nearly 2 hours, but we were able to get a table under that.

I recently tried their kalbi jjim and it was out of this world. The meat was incredibly tender and flavorful, and the sauce had just the right amount of sweetness and spice.<br/>Additionally, the portion size of the kalbi jjim at Daeho is huge and can easily feed a group of 3-4 people. So, it's a great option for sharing with friends or family.<br/><br/>The staff is friendly and attentive, and they made sure my dining experience was enjoyable from start to finish.<br/>Only complaint was that since we had a lot of leftovers, we had to pay $1 for the togo boxes which was a bit ridiculous but better than wasting food I guess! <br/>Overall, I highly recommend Daeho to anyone looking for authentic Korean cuisine in the area. The kalbi jjim alone is worth the trip!</span></p>,\n",

For a group of 8 people, I'd recommend two kalbijjim with extra meat or only one of the two with extra meat. I also love the cheese, rice cakes and noodles as extra toppings.<br/><br/>The vegetable bibimbap is good but the portion was smaller than I expected. I think 2-3 people can share it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the wait times can get really long around dinner hours 5pm-7pm. We arrived around 4:10pm on a Sunday and were the second to be seated.

We joined the waitlist on Yelp about ~30 minutes prior to our arrival, and were able to order immediately after checking in. The ordering process is interesting - you have to order with the host and get seated after waiting for a bit. The restaurant is super clean, and the decoration is simple and modern. <br/><br/>After waiting about 20 minutes after ordering, we were seated and the food arrived almost immediately! This was pretty nice. We ordered 2 kalbijjim with extra meat, cheese, and rice cakes, and my grandma ordered the combination seolleongtang (which was gluten free because she has celiac). The food was freaking amazing!!! The short rib had such great flavor and spice. The rice cakes were chewy and yummy and the cheese on top was the perfect finishing touch for the dish. The purple rice is also so good!!! My grandma is not a big eater, but she proceeded to eat the entire huge bowl of soup, so I guess it was excellent as well!<br/><br/>We ordered 1 mild and 1 medium spicy, and I didn't notice a significant difference in the spice levels. <br/><br/>I loooooved this place and will definitely be back! I definitely recommend joining the Yelp waitlist ahead of time, as it gets super busy!</span></p>,\n",

      "I got food delivery from here last night, so I can't say anything about the service or ambiance, but the food was very mediocre. I got the spicy beef rib soup, and it came with a half-centimeter layer of oil on top. I had to spoon out all the oil before it became remotely edible. I'd never seen so much oil in a Korean soup before: it filled one of the banchan sections. The flavor was fine but a bit too spicy; at the end I couldn't finish the soup because the bottom was so concentrated with pepper flakes. Maybe it's just not for me, but if you love super hot and super oily, the spicy beef rib soup would be a great fit for you. It's just not something I would personally ever want to eat again.\n",

      "Braised short rib...mild was perfect. So glad we added the extra cheese on top. It was sufficient for 3 people with soju to share. If you're very hungry probably only enough for 2.I really enjoyed the sauce. It reminded me of a tomato based sauce. I would come here again as long as the wait isn't more than 1/2 hour.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "One of my favorite Korean spots for traditional dishes! Portions are huge and ideal for family style dining. We love the Su-yuk Yang ji brisket bone broth with mushrooms/leek, make sure you season it yourself as it comes completely without any pepper/salt. This last visit we also tried the hot stone bibimbap, which everyone really enjoyed as well. The restaurant itself can be very busy, especially on the weekends. Make sure to utilize the Yelp waitlist!\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The portions are SO BIG! Squid and beef rib include a very big squid and a ton of ribs! The ribs are tender and fell if the bone but still had a nice texture to it. The sauce is amazing and goes so well with the side dishes! The chive kimchi go extremely well with the squid! Everything is so good.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's been 3-years since I last ate here, and damn, the food is just as good as I remember! We were only a group of 2 so we decided to go with the galbijjim level 1 medium with the rice cakes and cheese (which is a must in my opinion).The meat is so tender and flavorful, plus all the sauce you put over the rice. It's comfort food at it's finest and perfect for a cold SF night. The serving size without the extra meat was probably good for 4 medium sized appetites, so we ended up with a good amount of leftovers.The galbijjim was as good as I remembered it, but definitely a lot more expensive. However, I do believe you can't put a price on good food, and if you really want something and it lives up to the hype, then it's worth every dim. Plus, it's a dish that I'll never be able to make on my own. I hadn't been here in a while and I forgot that you had to order before you sat down. So when you name gets called, have your order ready, and be prepared to wait an additional 20-30 minutes before you get to your table. The waitlist you have to do in-person, and can't be done via the app, which is a bummer. The wait on a Saturday was quoted at nearly 2 hours, but we were able to get a table under that. There's so much to walk around and see in Japantown that to fill the time was no prob. Just. be close enough to check-in once you get the text that your table is ready.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I've been here a couple times, and it's always really good. I got the kalbijjim with tendon and rice cake. The tendon is super soft and rice cake is perfectly chewy. It comes with a large amount of beef, carrots, potato, onions and other veggies I probably forgot. The banchan is also really good, and I always take it all home. Since the portion is so big, I also eat this for days after and its still so yummy. Service is also quite good, and attentive despite how busy they are. I came here with my friend once and they seated us right away, even though there were a lot of people waiting. If you have a smaller party and everyone is there, be sure to ask the host if theres room!\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place is a little overpriced but it never lets me down. The sauce is not too sweet and not too spicy. The cheese is perfectly melted. The rice cake and veggies are cooked just right. The ribs are tender and juicy. I always find myself coming back to this place every time I visit the bay. It definitely lives up to the reputation!\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I visited this place last night with my 6 family members. We joined the waitlist on Yelp about ~30 minutes prior to our arrival, and were able to order immediately after checking in. The ordering process is interesting - you have to order with the host and get seated after waiting for a bit. The restaurant is super clean, and the decoration is simple and modern. After waiting about 20 minutes after ordering, we were seated and the food arrived almost immediately! This was pretty nice. We ordered 2 kalbijjim with extra meat, cheese, and rice cakes, and my grandma ordered the combination seolleongtang (which was gluten free because she has celiac). The food was freaking amazing!!! The short rib had such great flavor and spice. The rice cakes were chewy and yummy and the cheese on top was the perfect finishing touch for the dish. The purple rice is also so good!!! My grandma is not a big eater, but she proceeded to eat the entire huge bowl of soup, so I guess it was excellent as well!We ordered 1 mild and 1 medium spicy, and I didn't notice a significant difference in the spice levels. I loooooved this place and will definitely be back! I definitely recommend joining the Yelp waitlist ahead of time, as it gets super busy!\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Daeho is always a solid spot for a hungry group of friends! The max number of people that can seat together at a table is 8-9.The kalbijjim and kalbitang are really good! For a group of 8 people, I'd recommend two kalbijjim with extra meat or only one of the two with extra meat. I also love the cheese, rice cakes and noodles as extra toppings.The vegetable bibimbap is good but the portion was smaller than I expected. I think 2-3 people can share it.Unfortunately the wait times can get really long around dinner hours 5pm-7pm. We arrived around 4:10pm on a Sunday and were the second to be seated. Get there early if you don't want to wait too long!\n",
