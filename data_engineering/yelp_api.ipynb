       "[\"- everything about kothai is aesthetic - they have a gorgeous, modern interior with wood tones, and their choice of tableware is minimalist, but sophisticated. my friends were impressed by the weight of the sharing plates haha - the menu isn't that extensive (only 1 page long), and they seem to change it periodically- service could've been a little better. we had a pretty large group so we made a reservation, but still had to wait a fair bit before being seated. they also took a while to take our order and get us the check. - portions are larger IRL than in the pictures which we were pleasantly surprised by!- they have a garlic chili crunch sauce and a green garlic chili sauce which was actually pretty spicy- spicy korean noodle (3/5): the plating was nice, but the flavors did not impress me unfortunately. this is a cold noodle dish (which the waitress double-checked i knew after i ordered) that comes with pork jowl. the pork was a little too salty and the spicy sauce that the noodles were coated in wasn't anything impressive. it wasn't that spicy, but you can definitely feel it on your lips by the time you finish your meal. - korean BBQ skirt (4/5): steak was at a perfect medium rare, and super juicy and flavorful. the kalbi marinade was just the right amount of sweetness, and paired well with the burnt onion puree/sauce which was earthy, full of umami, and had just the right hint of horseradish. a little on the pricey side though. - i tried my friend's beef noodle soup, and it just tasted like taiwanese beef noodle soup with more mild flavors. - kothai attempts a korean and thai fusion, however the fusion of the flavors from these two cuisines doesn't seem to complement one another too well. the flavors are just a little off, and leaves me craving the authentic version instead. - i had been wanting to try this place due to the hype, and though it is very aesthetically pleasing, the food unfortunately fell flat, and i most likely wouldn't come back again\",\n",
       " 'The food was overall not bad. It was decent, nothing special, but the portions were extremely tiny for an absurd price (the price of two appetizers and one entree was $50). Although it wasn\\'t bad, it was definitely not worth the price. I\\'ve had better Korean/Thai food at a way cheaper price. Some would say it\\'s quality over quantity, which is what I thought before my experience, but afterwards, I can confidently say that it is more about presentation than anything else.Regardless of the food, I had more of a problem with the service and my waiter in general. I don\\'t want to name any names or call anyone out due to their job safety, but my whole table was completely taken aback by a comment he had made at the end of our meal. My group had stopped by for a quick bite to eat before leaving the city and had literally just stopped for boba on the way there. We came into the restaurant with our boba drinks as well. After eating (two appetizers and one entree), our waiter came up to our table and asked us, word for word, \"Was there something wrong with the food? Did you not like it?\" I proceeded to tell him that everything was fine. He explained that he asked us because we \"had not eaten much\". However we were just not extremely hungry, or willing to pay that price for a satisfactory meal. Not to mention, there were very few things on the menu. The comment made by the waiter severely influenced my decision to write this review. It was definitely an irregular and quite disrespectful question to ask a customer, and I was shocked by the audacity he had to ask it.',\n",
       " \"Ordered the Tom yum and the beef noodle soup the other day! In terms of the flavor - I thought both were pretty decent. Tom yum had just a bit of a kick and classic soury soupiness. I wish the beef noodle soup would have had a deeper/richer flavor of the beef broth and a bit less sweetness which I guess can come down to personal preference as well.Loved the ambience/decor of the restaurant as Idt there are too many like this in the 9th ave area. I think it's a bit pricer (both were $22-23) than what I was expecting, but reasonable if you factor in the general ambience of the restaurant.\",\n",
       " \"Kothai Republic has so much potential and I can foresee that if they tweak their dishes just a bit, this place can exceed expectations. Came here on a Tuesday and there was no one in the restaurant but my boyfriend and I were enticed but the pictures so we decided to give it a try.Waitress was amiable, quick and efficient and made sure we were checked up on constantly. The food, on the other hand, was of high quality ingredients but I didn't really care much for the execution of the dishes. The pear and beet salad was a strange combo and the sweetness of the pears overwhelmed the overall crisp salad which I personally could not palate. The beef noodle soup was delicious but the broth was overly salty for me. The beef was tender and juicy and made up for the broth. The noodles were cooked to perfection and was able to withhold \\xa0the flavors the broth well.Overall, I do see this place taking off in the near future.\",\n",
       " \"Amazing service, very clean, lots of sunlight, and delicious food. The service is very attentive, all cutlery and plates were very clean, and the seats comfortable to sit on. The noodles and rice dishes are completely worth it. They were delicious and one plate/bowl could be shared with ~3 people, or you could eat it for one person and be completely full.However, the amount of food for some the appetizers is quite small for how expensive it is per plate. For example, the Thai Crudo and the Kimchi Rice Balls are quite expensive for only a few bites. I wish the Thai Crudo had more raw fish ): only a few bites more please!I also thought some of the appetizers and entree plates aren't quite balanced -- I personally felt some of the plates could use some acidity, be it lime, pickled vegetables, etc. Additionally, it would also be great if they had multiple desserts to try, but it's okay since the street the restaurant is on has multiple dessert places. All in all, as a Thai person who ate here, I enjoyed it and thought it was worth trying at least once.\",\n",
       " \"Came here last week to get some lunch for my friend's birthday and I am so glad that we picked this place! I had no idea what to expect initially given their shorter menu that deviated from common Thai and Korean dishes but boy was this place amazing. I ordered the Korean Spicy Noodle with Grilled Chicken and Peanut Sauce and the Tom Yum Noodle Soup. Both items were absolutely delicious! The chef did such a great job with flavor and the dishes were perfectly balanced with elements of spiciness, sweetness, and some acidity. Kothai is clearly very intentional with what they put on the menu and work hard to perfect those dishes. On top of the delicious food, a free Cheesecake topped with a tasty Apple Crumble was given to my friend for free to celebrate her birthday. The cheesecake was not overly sweet and had a nice crunch due to the apple crumble topping. The service was incredible as well with prompt and friendly servers. I will definitely be coming back here again! Do check this place out when you are craving some delicious food without a pretentious ambience.\",\n",
       " \"Ambiance: it's cozy - great for night out with friends. Maybe a little tight for romantic date night. Servers were all super friendly and gave great recommendations on the menu. Food:Kbbq Skirt Steak [4/5]: yummy, tender, juicy - with fantastic marinade. Burnt onion puree was a nice sweet touch. Hamachi collar [4/5]: probably my favorite part of any fish because the meat is so tender here. (My BF thought it was slightly fishy but he isn't a huge seafood fan - I thought it was perfectly fine) Skin was crispy as well and loved the kick of the chili oil. Ceviche [5/5]: this dish came first and WOW. I absolutely LOVED this. The red shrimp had a nice tangy bite, loved the kick of the garlic. Had great texture, was super fresh, light, and super tasty. 10/10 recommend!! Korean Spicy Noodle [4/5]: was yummy and what you'd expect from spicy cold noodles. The grilled pork jowl had tasty marinade on it (my BF said it tasted like tofu hahaha - not a bad thing just an interesting comment) but was enjoyable. It was kinda cold that day so probably shouldve gone with a soupy noodle. Apple Pie Cheesecake [4/5]: cheesecake in a mason jar - super cute and yummy. Tasted exactly like your traditional apple pie and of fall :)\",\n",
       " 'The restaurant decorated nicely. It has the perfect vibe for rainy day with the tall glass windows. The customer service was awesome! They constantly filled your water. I ordered the spicy Tom Yum. The bowl looked small, but there were so much food (lots of noodles). I really enjoyed the spiciness of this dish. It was not fake or crazy spicy. The shrimps were fresh and jumbo size. Would totally go here again!',\n",
       " 'Definitely lived up to the 5 star rating. The food was very good and it was in a great location. We enjoyed the sights and sounds while enjoying fine beef noodle soup.',\n",
       " 'Overall great experience! The food always was surprising, tasty and well executed. In my opinion, the restaurant offers an amazing price/value and would recommend if you want to enjoy a more \"upscale\" cuisine.The \"Kimchi Rice Ball\" were definitely my favorite! We also took the chicken toast which was full of different spices and mix of flavors. To enjoy it the best, make sure you divide the toppings, cucumber & red onion, equally as they definitely offer a nice final touch to the dish. Unfortunately, some of the appetizers were already sold out when we arrive, 7:30PM, which was a bit surprising and disappointing.The TomYum Noodle Soup has a good balance between the two cuisines. I really enjoy the bites of crispy pork belly! The dish can be spicy.The dessert was a Apple Crumble cheesecake - light and yummy! I personally prefer my apples with a bit less cinnamon and a bit more caramelized.On another note, some table might be cold as people get in and out of the restaurant. I would suggest (1) put the wait long sign on the window so people\\'s don\\'t have to get in which will result in less traffic and (2) maybe a curtain or fake wall around the door could help with the cold from outside and create a nice separation.']"

       "'Fun experience, cool atmosphere and delicious food. Got the stew and it came steaming and sizzling to our table. It tasted amazing. It was very busy but the wait staff took care of everyone without issues. Will definitely be back_______JOINED_THE_MESSAGE_ON THIS_STRING_______I came to Daeho after checking out the Cherry Blossom Festival in Japantown. I recommend using the Yelp waitlist so you can explore things in the area just in case it\\'s full! We ordered the Daeho Suyuk Royal Brisket, and it was huge! It was a brisket in a broth with mushrooms and (I think?) green onions on top. There was a lot of meat, and they gave sides like kimchi and seasame oil (if you ask) so you can add some more flavor.If I\\'d come again I would try the bibimbap and kalbijimm, seeing it on other peoples tables looked really tasty!_______JOINED_THE_MESSAGE_ON THIS_STRING_______Good food. Nice service.A bit noisy but worth to near with it for that delicious food._______JOINED_THE_MESSAGE_ON THIS_STRING_______I recently visited Daeho Kalbijjim & Beef Soup and was thoroughly impressed with the quality of their bone broth soup. Despite being picky about my bone broth soup, the flavor and depth of the broth surpassed my expectations, and the meat was cooked perfectly.The Kalbijjim was also a standout dish - the meat was incredibly tender and the sauce was the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The service was also excellent - the staff were friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu._______JOINED_THE_MESSAGE_ON THIS_STRING_______So gooooood, spicy but tasty. A little expensive but worth it. Try the soup, the beef rib, all good._______JOINED_THE_MESSAGE_ON THIS_STRING_______Just as amazing as the name lives up to be. Spicy, savory and full of flavor Daeho does not disappoint. Our party of 6 came on a Tuesday for dinner and was able to get seated within 10 mins. We preordered the large kalbijjim and added glass noodles and of course cheese! Also adding a seafood bibimbap. The amount of food was definitely filled us up but if you\\'re heavy meat eater maybe opt for more than one plate of kalbijjim. The 3-4 portion kalbijjim came with 3 bowls of rice to which you can chose from either purple or white rice. The meat was fall off the bone tender and seasoned so well! All the fixings, potatoes, and onions over rice made for a delicious bite. The bibimbap also came with a bunch a vegetables to help balance the heavy meal which served as a nice break. Not to mention they serve a variety of kimchis along with the meal. Overall a delicious and filling meal. We all left happy and needing to go on a walk after!_______JOINED_THE_MESSAGE_ON THIS_STRING_______This place is always busy and there is a good reason why! The food is incredible; it\\'s expensive but you can split one of the large kalbijjim\\'s between 4 people easy and split the tab. I tried one with cheese and one without - I say the cheese is more for show (and cheese lovers) but not a huge difference in the taste of the meal.Tip on the wait; it\\'s best to get there right when they open and hop in line to put your name on the waitlist. KEY thing to remember is that when they text you the first time to \"check in\" it\\'s not really a check in, its because your table is almost ready and they have you order your food ahead of time (this is so it comes out within a few minutes of you getting seated). Be aware that they may make you wait a 2nd time until your actual table is ready (last time I waited an additional 30-40 mins but just walked across the street to have a drink). The process is a bit weird I know, but I get it, they\\'re trying to accommodate everyone and have food out quickly to rotate tables. Overall, I\\'ve had nothing but a good experience here._______JOINED_THE_MESSAGE_ON THIS_STRING_______Very good, flavorful fresh food but very expensive. Expect a big bill and to be still hungry after your meal. Nice decor, long wait times but worth it._______JOINED_THE_MESSAGE_ON THIS_STRING_______Braised short rib...mild was perfect. So glad we added the extra cheese on top. It was sufficient for 3 people with soju to share. If you\\'re very hungry probably only enough for 2.I really enjoyed the sauce. It reminded me of a tomato based sauce. I would come here again as long as the wait isn\\'t more than 1/2 hour._______JOINED_THE_MESSAGE_ON THIS_STRING_______One of my favorite Korean spots for traditional dishes! Portions are huge and ideal for family style dining. We love the Su-yuk Yang ji brisket bone broth with mushrooms/leek, make sure you season it yourself as it comes completely without any pepper/salt. This last visit we also tried the hot stone bibimbap, which everyone really enjoyed as well. The restaurant itself can be very busy, especially on the weekends. Make sure to utilize the Yelp waitlist!'"
